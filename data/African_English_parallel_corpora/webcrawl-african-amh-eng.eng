Of course, she does not “submit” to abuse—that is not right or lawful or God-honoring.
We also know from Scripture that it is at this judgment when the dead will be “judged according to what they had done” (Revelation 20:12) and that “anyone’s name” that is not “found written in the book of life” will be “thrown into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:15).
Both are valid meanings of the Greek word translated “from.” However, it is important to recognize what believers are promised to be kept from.

If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and receive forgiveness from God, here is prayer you can pray.
To be clear, salvation is more than saying a prayer or “making a decision” for Christ; salvation is a sovereign act of God whereby an unregenerate sinner is washed, renewed, and born again by the Holy Spirit (John 3:3; Titus 3:5).

 In the above passage, we not only find the word “all” being used repeatedly, but we also find “all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered,” “the waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet,“ and “every living thing that moved on the earth perished.” These descriptions clearly describe a universal flood covering the whole earth.
‘Never, Lord!’ he said.
“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).
In summary, the church is not a building or a denomination.
Ephesians 1:7 says, "In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace."
How could tongues be a gift for self-edification if not every believer can possess it?
A correct reading would be “the grave” or “sheol.” Jesus said to the thief beside Him, “Today you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43); He did not say, “I will see you in hell.” Jesus’ body was in the tomb; His soul/spirit went to be with the blessed in sheol/hades.
May God open the eyes of the Jehovah’s Witnesses to the truth of the gospel and the true teaching of God’s Word.
Jesus Himself indicates that punishment in hell is just as everlasting as life in heaven (Matthew 25:46).
When we walk in the Spirit, we find that the sinful appetites of the flesh have no more dominion over us.
God the Father bears witness of Jesus’ identity as well: “But about the Son he says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom’” (Hebrews 1:8; cf.
Only those who are born again have their sins forgiven and have a relationship with God.
The word spirit refers only to the immaterial facet of humanity.
Now, why would Paul tell them to strongly desire the “greater” gifts if they already had been given all they would be given, and there was no further opportunity of gaining these greater gifts?
Death in the Scriptures refers to a “separation.” Everyone will die, but some will live in heaven with the Lord for eternity, while others will live a life in hell for eternity.
 1) Physicians are not God and should not be viewed as such.
Jehovah’s Witnesses reject the concept of Christ’s substitutionary atonement and instead hold to a ransom theory, that Jesus’ death was a ransom payment for Adam’s sin.
 Teaching – the Scriptures and a biblical worldview (Psalm 78:5-6; Deuteronomy 4:10; Ephesians 6:4)
Carson
When one is saved, he/she has been born again, spiritually renewed, and is now a child of God by right of new birth.
The Holy Spirit is the means by whom the Father does the following works: creation and maintenance of the universe (Genesis 1:2; Job 26:13; Psalm 104:30); divine revelation (John 16:12-15; Ephesians 3:5; 2 Peter 1:21); salvation (John 3:6; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:2); and Jesus’ works (Isaiah 61:1; Acts 10:38).
  That verse teaches us several things.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
                                                                                         Answer
A literal, physical rule of Christ is the only way the covenants can be fulfilled as God promised they would.
Because of that, they are to be separate from the world—in the world, but not of the world—and nowhere is that more important than in life’s most intimate relationship—marriage.
Pornography is addictive (1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19) and destructive (Proverbs 6:25-28; Ezekiel 20:30; Ephesians 4:19).
He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.
The Wednesday opinion states that there were two Sabbaths that week.
After Jesus describes some of the end-times happenings, He says, “Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened” (Matthew 24:34).
That such a God would bend an ear to His creatures causes praise and adoration to pour forth in abundance (Psalm 27:4; 63:1-8), produces heartfelt repentance and confession (Psalm 51; Luke 18:9-14), generates an outpouring of gratitude and thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6; Colossians 1:12), and creates sincere intercessory pleas on behalf of others (2 Thessalonians 1:11; 2:16).
First Corinthians 15 goes on to describe how Christ’s resurrection proves His victory over sin and provides us the power to live victoriously over sin (1 Corinthians 15:24-34).
                                                                                         Answer
The lake of fire is the permanent and final place of judgment for the lost.
Paul learned that, although the pressure he faced was beyond his ability to endure, the Lord can bear all things: “This happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead” (2 Corinthians 1:9).
Angels possess intelligence (Matthew 8:29; 2 Corinthians 11:3; 1 Peter 1:12), show emotion (Luke 2:13; James 2:19; Revelation 12:17), and exercise will (Luke 8:28-31; 2 Timothy 2:26; Jude 6).
For example, David, in his defeat of Goliath, teaches us that God is greater than anything He asks us to face (1 Samuel 17), while his giving in to the temptation to commit adultery with Bathsheba reveals just how long-lasting and terrible the consequences of a moment’s sinful pleasure can be (2 Samuel 11).
Almost every major religion teaches that Jesus was a prophet or a good teacher or a godly man.
Systematic theology takes all the information about angels from all the books of the Bible and organizes it into a system called angelology.
The tithe was a requirement of the Law in which the Israelites were to give 10 percent of the crops they grew and the livestock they raised to the tabernacle/temple (Leviticus 27:30; Numbers 18:26; Deuteronomy 14:24; 2 Chronicles 31:5).
It’s no surprise that the world rejects God’s design, but God’s people should be joyfully celebrating that design.
Psalm 14:1, written by David around 1000 B.C., mentions atheism: “The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” Recent statistics show an increasing number of people claiming to be atheists, up to 10 percent of people worldwide.
Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools” (Romans 1:19-22).
Yes, human beings are called to make a genuine decision to place faith in Christ unto salvation.
It was simply a matter of God’s convincing His human followers which books should be included in the Bible.
The lamb was then roasted and eaten with unleavened bread.
 Questions about the Church
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness!
We make many important decisions based on this emotion, and even get married because we feel that we are “in love.” This may be the reason about half of all first marriages end in divorce.
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor…to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve…to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.”
Both of these passages encourage us to pray and to keep praying.

Preterism teaches that every event normally associated with the end times—Christ’s second coming, the tribulation, the resurrection of the dead, the final judgment—has already happened.
The religion of Islam, which a majority of Arabs follow, has made the hostility predicted of Ishmael more profound.
If you place your faith in Jesus, trusting His death as the payment for your sins, all of your sins are forgiven and washed away.
                                                                                         Answer
However, these three occasions are the only places in the Bible where speaking in tongues is an evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit.
Therefore, being “healed” in both these verses is speaking of being forgiven and saved, not physically healed.
An illustration would be a man randomly handing out money to five people in a crowd of twenty.
It is important to distinguish the indwelling from the filling of the Spirit.
Jesus was simply exposing the hypocrisy of the Pharisees.
Pornography appeals to the “lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes” (1 John 2:16) and is therefore condemned by God as well.
                                                                                         Answer
No one deserves anything from God; therefore, no one can object if he does not receive anything from God.
 Typically, when this question is asked, the person asking qualifies the question with “outside of the Bible.” We do not grant this idea that the Bible cannot be considered a source of evidence for the existence of Jesus.
Romans 12:3-8 lists the spiritual gifts as follows: prophecy, serving others (in a general sense), teaching, exhorting, generosity, leadership, and showing mercy.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
In the parable of the two sons, Jesus rebukes the chief priests and elders for failing to do the will of the Father; specifically, they “did not repent and believe” (Matthew 21:32).
 ወንዶችም ሆኑ ሴቶች እንደ እግዚአብሔር የተፈጠሩ ናቸው፤ ምክንያቱም እንደ እግዚአብሔር አእምሮ ፍቃድ ስሜት ስሜትና የሞራል ጥንካሬ ያላቸው ከመሆናቸውም በላይ ከሌሎቹ ፍጥረቶች ሁሉ ይበልጣሉ፡፡ እንስሳት የሞራል ስብዕና አቅም የላቸውም እንዲሁም እንደ ሰው ልጅ ቁስ አካልነት የሌላቸው አካላት የላቸውም፡፡ የሰው ልጅ ብቻ የእግዚአብሔር አምሳል ያለው መንፈሳዊ አካል ነው፡፡ እግዚአብሔር የሰው ልጆችን ከፈጠረው ጋር ከእርሱ ጋር ግንኙነት እንዲኖረው አድርጓል፡፡ ለዚህ ዓላማ የተነደፈው ብቸኛው ፍጥረት ሰብአዊ ፍጡር ነው፡፡ያ በመሆኑም ወንድ እና ሴት ከእግዚአብሔር አምሳል የተቀረጹ ናቸዉ፡፡ እነሱም የእግዚአብሔር ትንሽ «ቅጂዎች» አይደሉም፡፡ እውነታው ወንድ እና ሴት መኖሩ እግዚአብሔር ወንድና ሴት መለያዎች እንዲኖረው አይጠይቅም፡፡ አስታውስ በእግዚአብሔር አምሳል መፈጠር ከቁሳዊ አካል ጠባዮች ጋር ምንም ግንኙነት የለውም፡፡.
God says, “Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?” (Amos 3:3).
In addition to praying and sharing our faith, we must also live godly Christian lives in front of our friends and family members so they can see the change God has made in us (1 Peter 3:1–2).
“Hallowed be your name” is telling us to worship God, and to praise Him for who He is.
For example, David, in his defeat of Goliath, teaches us that God is greater than anything He asks us to face (1 Samuel 17), while his giving in to the temptation to commit adultery with Bathsheba reveals just how long-lasting and terrible the consequences of a moment’s sinful pleasure can be (2 Samuel 11).
The fruit of the Spirit is what God desires our lives to exhibit and, with the Holy Spirit’s help, it is possible!
Meditating on God’s Word and obeying its teachings will bring success in life (Joshua 1:8; James 1:25).
Notice that what we need comes “through our knowledge of Him,” which is the key to obtaining everything we need.
“But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20 NAS).
 The greatest commandment in Scripture is this: “Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength” (Deuteronomy 6:5).
Since it is an exhortation, it follows that it is also possible to not be filled or controlled by the Spirit.
The Bible teaches that the good works we do cannot make us acceptable to God.
But when the Spirit is in control, He produces godly qualities within us, apart from the strictures of the Law (verses 22–23).
                                                                                         Answer
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Dispensationalism teaches that the promises God made to Israel in the Old Testament (for land, many descendants, and blessings) will be ultimately fulfilled in the 1000-year period spoken of in Revelation 20.
John 3:16 tells us, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Salvation is gained by faith (Ephesians 2:8), by receiving Jesus as Savior (John 1:12), and by fully trusting Jesus alone (John 14:6; Acts 4:12), not by reciting a prayer.
The Bible is the description God gave us about who He is, and His desires and plans for humanity.
The verb tense in Ephesians 5:18 indicates a continual process of “being filled” by the Holy Spirit.
The hunger that you feel is a spiritual hunger, and can only be filled by Jesus.
In fact, we can almost reconstruct the gospel just from early non-Christian sources: Jesus was called the Christ (Josephus), did “magic,” led Israel into new teachings, and was hanged on Passover for them (Babylonian Talmud) in Judea (Tacitus), but claimed to be God and would return (Eliezar), which his followers believed, worshiping Him as God (Pliny the Younger).
Unconditional election is the view that God elects individuals to salvation based entirely on His will, not on anything inherently worthy in the individual.
Joshua cast lots to determine the allotment of land to the various tribes.
Jesus’ praying to the Father was a demonstration of His relationship within the Trinity and an example for us that we must rely on God through prayer for the strength and wisdom we need.

 The core beliefs of Christianity are summarized in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.
The intended result of spiritual gifts is that the church as a whole can grow, being strengthened by the combined supply of each member of Christ’s body.
In calling His elect, God says, “Bring all who claim me as their God, for I have made them for my glory.
Without the authority of the Bible, any attempt to explain God’s attributes would be no better than an opinion, which by itself is often incorrect, especially in understanding God (Job 42:7).
Does God forgive divorce?
The fact that Cain was scared for his own life after he killed Abel (Genesis 4:14) indicates that there were likely many other children and perhaps even grandchildren of Adam and Eve already living at that time.
The word translated “tongues” in both Acts chapter 2 and 1 Corinthians chapter 14 is glossa which means “language.” It is the word from which we get our modern English word “glossary.” Speaking in tongues was the ability to speak in a language the speaker does not know, in order to communicate the gospel to someone who does speak that language.
No early church council decided on the canon.
Because of Scripture’s silence, getting inked falls under the category of a “gray area,” and believers should follow their convictions in the matter, respecting those who may have different convictions.
 Did Moses copy the Law from the Code of Hammurabi?
We can be saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone.
The new earth and the new heavens are sometimes referred to as the “eternal state.” Scripture gives us a few details of the new heavens and new earth.
Those who have not placed their faith in Jesus Christ must pay the penalty for these personal sins, as well as inherited and imputed sin.
                                                                                         Answer
His very name means “adversary” or “one who opposes.” Another of his titles, the devil, means “slanderer.”
                                                                                         Answer

The sheep (believers) enter into eternal life, while the goats (unbelievers) are cast into “eternal punishment” (Matthew 25:46).
Paul gives us the reason why: “The things that mark an apostle—signs, wonders and miracles—were done among you with great perseverance” (2 Corinthians 12:12).
Truly, the Bible is God’s love letter to mankind.
                                                                                         Answer
What we can know for sure is that it is God’s plan for a married couple to stay married as long as both spouses are alive (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:6).
Seeing someone whom we thought to be a Christian exhibiting the behavior of being demonized should cause us to question the genuineness of his/her faith.
By the way this is done, God places sole responsibility for the covenant upon Himself.
God is just; He is no respecter of persons in the sense of showing favoritism (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 18:30).
The ultimate goal of dating or courting is finding a life partner.
Christians lived according to Jesus’ laws, believed themselves to be immortal, and were characterized by contempt for death, and renunciation of material goods.
                                                                                         Answer
The fact that all of the apostles were willing to die horrible deaths, refusing to renounce their faith in Christ, is tremendous evidence that they had truly witnessed the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
The purpose of a biblical fast is not to lose weight, but rather to gain deeper fellowship with God.
Paul goes on to remind believers that they are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, who inhabits their hearts at salvation (2 Corinthians 6:15-17).
                                                                                         Answer
His praying showed His dependence upon His Father in His humanity to carry out His Father’s plan of redemption, as evidenced in Christ’s high priestly prayer in John 17.
Imputing our sin to Jesus, God treated Him as if He were a sinner, though He was not, and had Him die for the sins of the entire world (1 John 2:2).
The preterist takes this to mean that everything Jesus speaks of in Matthew 24 had to have occurred within one generation of His speaking—the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 was therefore “Judgment Day.”
Considering His closest followers had fled in fear at His arrest and crucifixion, it is most unlikely this ragtag band of frightened fishermen would have gone head to head against trained, professional soldiers.
It means a meeting of the mind and soul to form one unit.
                                                                                         Answer
6) The Roman army recruited soldiers from among the provinces, introducing these men to Roman culture and to ideas (such as the gospel) that had not reached those outlying provinces yet.
The apostle Paul addresses this issue in Galatians 3:3 when he asks, “Are you so foolish?

How could anyone, knowing the price Jesus Christ paid for us, go on to live a life of sin (Romans 6:15-23)?
The Holy Spirit takes up permanent residence in the hearts of believers (Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 6:19-20, 12:13).
To grieve the Spirit is to act out in a sinful manner, whether it is in thought only or in both thought and deed.
                                                                                         Answer
Ultimately, that should be our reaction as well.

“For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved” (Romans 10:10).
The Son of God is “of God.” The claim to be of the same nature as God—to in fact be God—was blasphemy to the Jewish leaders; therefore, they demanded Jesus’ death, in keeping with Leviticus 24:15.
"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation: the old has gone, the new has come!"
And Jesus’ mention of “this generation” should be taken to mean the generation that is alive to see the beginning of the events described in Matthew 24.

Throughout the Bible we see God lovingly and mercifully calling people into a special relationship with Himself, not because they deserve it, but because He is a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.
                                                                                         Answer

In this passage, though, we are given a warning: we are not to be deceived, because these events are only the beginning of birth pains; the end is still to come.
Son of Man is a fulfillment of prophecy. Jesus’ claim before the high priest to be the Son of Man was a reference to the prophecy of Daniel 7:13–14, “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven.
In response to this loving leadership, it is not difficult for the wife to submit to her husband’s authority (Ephesians 5:24; Colossians 3:18).

According to the Bible, though, the appropriate and restrained physical discipline of children is a good thing and contributes to the well-being and correct upbringing of the child.
 The baptism of the Holy Spirit may be defined as that work whereby the Spirit of God places the believer into union with Christ and into union with other believers in the body of Christ at the moment of salvation.

Romans 5:8 tells us, "But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
If there were more than one God, the universe would be in disorder because of multiple creators and authorities, but it is not in disorder; therefore, there is only one God.
It is God’s power and grace that saves people, not our efforts.
This word represents a special kind of “mother love.” The idea that flows out of this word is that of caring for our children, nurturing them, affectionately embracing them, meeting their needs, and tenderly befriending each one as a unique gift from the hand of God.
Another principle that would protect the longevity of a marriage is that the husband should obey God and love, honor, and protect his wife as he would his own body (Ephesians 5:25–31).
God imputed Christ’s righteousness to those who humbly ask for forgiveness of sin (Isaiah 53:5-6; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
The literal interpretation gives each word the meaning it would commonly have in everyday usage.

When the Bible does not cover a certain subject, we have some general principles in His Word to guide us.
We see this wonderful truth in verses like 1 John 4:10: “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.” In the Old Testament, God provided a sacrificial system whereby atonement could be made for sin.
“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
Paul did not go to the synagogue to fellowship with and edify the saints, but to convict and save the lost.
Psalm 14:1, written by David around 1000 B.C., mentions atheism: “The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” Recent statistics show an increasing number of people claiming to be atheists, up to 10 percent of people worldwide.
Revelation 13:5 says that this will go on for 42 months, which is 3 1/2 years.
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.

Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the LORD, but only from the physicians.” The issue was not that Asa consulted physicians, but that “he did not seek help from the LORD.” Even when visiting a doctor, our ultimate faith is to be in God, not the doctor.
Verses such as Genesis 6:6, “The LORD was grieved that He had made man on the earth, and His heart was filled with pain.” Also, Exodus 32:14 proclaims, “Then the LORD relented and did not bring on His people the disaster He had threatened.” These verses speak of the Lord “repenting” or “relenting” of something and seem to contradict the doctrine of God’s immutability.
However, full preterism has some serious flaws in that it denies the physical reality of Christ’s second coming and downplays the dreadful nature of the tribulation by restricting that event to the fall of Jerusalem.
 By far, the most searched for terms on the internet are related to pornography.
Scripture also encourages us to stay away from attempts to “get rich quick” (Proverbs 13:11; 23:5; Ecclesiastes 5:10).

Regarding Jesus’ birth—Isaiah 7:14: “Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.” Isaiah 9:6: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.
Another way of expressing this same basic thought is when people say, “The God of the Old Testament is a God of wrath while the God of the New Testament is a God of love.” The fact that the Bible is God’s progressive revelation of Himself to us through historical events and through His relationship with people throughout history might contribute to misconceptions about what God is like in the Old Testament as compared to the New Testament.
First, it is important to recognize the purpose of the tribulation.
Romans 16:5 says, “Greet the church that is in their house.” Paul refers to the church in their house—not a church building, but a body of believers.
'“ Many people misunderstand the Lord’s Prayer to be a prayer we are supposed to recite word for word.
The new earth and the new heavens are sometimes referred to as the “eternal state.” Scripture gives us a few details of the new heavens and new earth.

Ephesians 1:22–23 says, “And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.” The body of Christ is made up of all believers in Jesus Christ from the day of Pentecost (Acts 2) until Christ’s return.

It seems inconsistent for God to promise believers that they will not suffer wrath and then leave them on the earth to suffer through the wrath of the tribulation.
It is critical to know the author, intended audience, and historical background of each passage one interprets.
He is the only man to have conquered death forever (Hebrews 2:14–15).
God promised Abraham that his posterity would have Canaan as “an everlasting possession” (Genesis 17:8), and Ezekiel prophesied a physical and spiritual resuscitation of Israel (Ezekiel 37).

The Bible tells us that we have all sinned and are therefore separated from God (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23).
It is one of the main purposes of the Christian life, though, to progressively allow the Holy Spirit to produce more and more of His fruit in our lives—and to allow the Holy Spirit to conquer the opposing sinful desires.

We are encouraged to ask God for the things we need in “give us today our daily bread.” “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors” reminds us to confess our sins to God and to turn from them, and also to forgive others as God has forgiven us.
The first verse on the Romans Road to salvation is Romans 3:23, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
First Corinthians 12:31 seems to indicate that this is possible: “earnestly desire the best gifts.” You can seek a spiritual gift from God and be zealous after it by seeking to develop that area.
God’s love for everyone could be thought of as His “merciful love,” since it results in the fact that God does not immediately punish people for their sins (Romans 3:23; 6:23).
We are sinners not because we sin; rather, we sin because we are sinners.
 Many people ask, “Is there a prayer I can pray that will guarantee my salvation?” It is important to remember that salvation is not received by reciting a prayer or uttering certain words.

Even when the biblical roles are properly understood, many choose to reject them in favor of a supposed “emancipation” of women, with the result that the family unit is torn apart.
We should not live our Christian lives wondering and worrying each day whether we are truly saved.
Predestination is the biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved.

The very idea that human beings think in non-physical, moral terms is striking.
Spiritual gift tests or inventories, while not to be fully relied upon, can definitely help us understand where our gifting might be.
This sometimes results in the baptism of the Spirit being confused with “receiving the Spirit” as an act subsequent to salvation.

Dispensationalism has two primary distinctives: 1) a consistently literal interpretation of Scripture, especially Bible prophecy, and 2) a view of the uniqueness of Israel as separate from the Church in God’s program.
In 1 Corinthians chapters 12–14, Paul discusses miraculous gifts, saying, “Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?” (1 Corinthians 14:6).

If God is impartial and loves us with impartiality, then we need to love others with that same high standard.
‘But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven’” (Matthew 26:64).
    What does it mean that husbands are to love their wives?
Our few days here on earth are so short and precious in relation to eternity that we ought never to waste time on selfish things, but to use it only on “what is helpful for building others up according to their needs” (Ephesians 4:29).
At that time, He will restore full fellowship with redeemed mankind, while the unredeemed will have been judged unworthy and cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11–15).
In other words, Jesus is sending one like Himself to be with us and in us.
In these verses, Jesus is reinforcing the accuracy of the Scriptures down to the smallest detail and the slightest punctuation mark, because it is the very Word of God.
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, here is a sample prayer.
Christ is promising to keep believers from the very time period that contains the trials, namely the tribulation.
The more time we spend intimately with God and His Word, the easier it is to recognize His voice and His leading in our lives.
The Jewish Sabbath was abolished at the cross where Christ “canceled the written code, with its regulations” (Colossians 2:14).
Notice that we “all” have been baptized by the Spirit—all believers have received the baptism, synonymous with salvation, and it is not a special experience for only a few.
God the Son Incarnate: The Doctrine of Christ by Stephen Wellum
It would be a real and intelligible language (1 Corinthians 14:10).
“For the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).
                                                                                         Answer
There is no one who is not affected by the harsh realities of life, and the question “why do bad things happen to good people?” is one of the most difficult questions in all of theology.
 What can a married couple do to ensure that their marriage will last?
According to the Bible, the church is the body of Christ—all those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ for salvation (John 3:16; 1 Corinthians 12:13).
There are two lists in Galatians 5:19-23.
Through Jesus Christ, we can have our sins forgiven and restore a right relationship with God."
Note that in Luke 23:56 the women who had purchased spices after the first Sabbath returned and prepared the spices, then “rested on the Sabbath.” The argument states that they could not purchase the spices after the Sabbath, yet prepare those spices before the Sabbath—unless there were two Sabbaths.
To the Romans he wrote, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
3) “You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.” This is a command against taking the name of the Lord in vain.
For unbelievers, life after death is eternity in the lake of fire.
As He hung there on the cross, He took the sin burden of the whole human race upon Himself.
Jesus alone speaks with the authority of God because Jesus alone conquered death.
is blatant adultery (Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3).
The Savior who was promised in the Old Testament is fully revealed in the New Testament.
Make any other decision, and eternal separation from God in hell will be the result (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).
It is God’s wise plan for how the family should function.
                                                                                         Answer
“The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).
In Paul’s writing, the spiritual is pivotal to the life of the believer (1 Corinthians 2:14; 3:1; Ephesians 1:3; 5:19; Colossians 1:9; 3:16).
Perhaps this sometimes applies to remarriage after a divorce.
Rock carvings in South America depict men riding diplodocus-like creatures and, amazingly, bear the familiar images of triceratops-like, pterodactyl-like, and tyrannosaurus rex-like creatures.
This is not to say that God does not work miracles or even speak through dreams today, but anything God says, whether through a dream, vision, impression, or “still small voice,” will agree completely with what He has already revealed in His Word.
We are all three times condemned due to inherited sin, imputed sin, and personal sin.
Christians believe in one God that exists in three persons—the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.
                                                                                         Answer
With the strong biblical evidence that a Christian cannot be demon possessed in view, some Bible teachers use the term “demonization” to refer to a demon having control over a Christian.
It was simply a matter of God’s convincing His human followers which books should be included in the Bible.
Nowhere in Scripture is there any hint that Sabbath-keeping was practiced from Adam to Moses.
Purchasing the spices after the first Sabbath (Passover) would have meant they purchased them on Saturday and were breaking the Sabbath.
In it we see how a loving, merciful, and just God deals with sinful men in all kinds of situations.
While this evidence is more subjective than the first two, it is no less a powerful testimony of the divine origin of the Bible.
He, the perfect Son of God, became the fulfillment of the countless Old Testament prophecies concerning a Redeemer (Genesis 3:15; Psalm 22; Isaiah 53).
God promises forgiveness of sins and eternal life in heaven to all who receive, by grace through faith, Jesus Christ as Savior (John 1:12; 3:16; 5:24; Acts 16:31).
Changed lives, reformed attitudes, and answers to prayer are all part of our personal perception that God exists.
Jesus fulfilled many of the prophecies of the Messiah during His birth, life, ministry, death, and resurrection.
Inside the Atheist Mind by Anthony DeStefano
We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.” Two key points make it highly unlikely that Romans 8:26 is referring to tongues as a prayer language.
God the Son Incarnate: The Doctrine of Christ by Stephen Wellum
It is the Holy Spirit’s job to conform us to the image of Christ, making us more like Him.
   Return to:
The Bible has a great deal to say about the way we can successfully raise our children to be men and women of God.
God imputed Christ’s righteousness to those who humbly ask for forgiveness of sin (Isaiah 53:5-6; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
John 3:16 tells us, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Salvation is gained by faith (Ephesians 2:8), by receiving Jesus as Savior (John 1:12), and by fully trusting Jesus alone (John 14:6; Acts 4:12), not by reciting a prayer.
For the New Testament, the process of the recognition and collection began in the first centuries of the Christian church.
Bolstering faith are human experience, logic, and empirical evidence, all of which help answer the question does God exist?
Muhammad, Confucius, and the others molder in their graves to this very day.
Only God Himself could provide an infinite, eternally valuable sacrifice (Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
So, back to the original question – “How can I know for sure that I will go to heaven when I die?” The answer is this – believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved (Acts 16:31).
In order to understand and interpret the passages in Scripture that deal with end-times events, there are two things that must be clearly understood: a proper method of interpreting Scripture and the distinction between Israel (the Jews) and the church (the body of all believers in Jesus Christ).
Just as God had mercifully brought the Israelites out of Egypt when they were nothing but penniless slaves and had given them a land of their own (Leviticus 25:38), so He expected them to express similar kindness to their own poor citizens.
First, angels were created as an order of creatures higher than humans.
The apostle Paul also mentions physical training in illustrating spiritual truth in 1 Corinthians 9:24-27.
About halfway through the seven years, the Antichrist will break the peace covenant with Israel and make war against it.
It is not uncommon today for people to believe that two diametrically opposed religions could both be equally “true,” even though both religions claim to have the only way to heaven or teach two totally opposite “truths.” People who do not believe in absolute truth ignore these claims and embrace a more tolerant universalism that teaches all religions are equal and all roads lead to heaven.
Yes, God can and will forgive any sin.
So, if God is a “something,” then He must have a cause, right?
“If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!” (Galatians 1:9).
 How can we recognize the voice of God?
In response to the accusation that grace promotes sin, the apostle Paul declared, “What shall we say, then?
For instance, Acts 20:7 states that “on the first day of the week we came together to break bread.” In 1 Corinthians 16:2 Paul urges the Corinthian believers “on the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income.” Since Paul designates this offering as “service” in 2 Corinthians 9:12, this collection must have been linked with the Sunday worship service of the Christian assembly.
Over and over again, the Bible warns against the accumulation of wealth and encourages us to seek spiritual riches instead.
First Corinthians 12:31 seems to indicate that this is possible: “earnestly desire the best gifts.” You can seek a spiritual gift from God and be zealous after it by seeking to develop that area.
Many Christians throughout history have written about their struggles in being assured of their salvation.
Conditional salvation is the view that a believer in Christ can, of his/her own free will, turn away from Christ and thereby lose salvation.
Also see Daniel 7:25, where the “time, times, and half a time” (time=1 year; times=2 years; half a time=1/2 year; total of 3 1/2 years) also refers to “great tribulation,” the last half of the seven-year tribulation period when the beast will be in power.
Second, Matthew 22:30 is referring to the “angels in heaven.” It is not referring to fallen angels, who do not care about God’s created order and actively seek ways to disrupt God’s plan.
                                                                                         Answer
The younger son wasted his father’s gift in shameful sin (verse 13).
Only by accepting God’s grace through the Lord Jesus Christ can people be saved from their sins and rescued from an eternity apart from God.
For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
 Where do you go when you die?
King Saul recognized Samuel when the witch of Endor summoned Samuel from the realm of the dead (1 Samuel 28:8-17).
There are countless other passages that point to a literal reign of the Messiah on the earth.
First, angels were created as an order of creatures higher than humans.
                                                                                         Answer
There is no substitute for personally sharing the gospel: “Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ” (Romans 10:17).
“He will be the sure foundation for your times, a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is the key to this treasure” (Isaiah 33:6).
God is omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere, but this does not mean that God is everything (Psalm 139:7-13; Jeremiah 23:23).
Jesus told the disciples that He would send the Spirit into the world to “convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment” (John 16:7-11).
Through religion, humans seek God, hope for the future, forgiveness of sins, peace in the midst of struggle, and answers to our deepest questions.
In doing so, the gene pool for a specific group shrank dramatically as the group no longer had the entire human population to mix with.
“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse” (Romans 1:20).
Those who believe in a younger age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does mention dinosaurs, though it never actually uses the word “dinosaur.” Instead, it uses the Hebrew word tanniyn, which is translated a few different ways in our English Bibles.
“For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
This is also not a question of can the Holy Spirit give someone a miraculous gift.
We make many important decisions based on this emotion, and even get married because we feel that we are “in love.” This may be the reason about half of all first marriages end in divorce.
Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin” (Acts 13:38–39).
Jesus constantly confronted them about their false teachings and hypocritical lifestyles.
He is the only man whom God has “exalted .
 What does it mean to be a born again Christian?
They may say things like, “My God would never send a person to hell.” But Jesus spoke more about hell than He did about heaven, and He presented Himself as the Savior who offers the only means of going to heaven: “I am the way and the truth and the life.
Romans 8:9 is even stronger, stating that if a person does not have the Spirit, he does not belong to Christ.
True love is a decision, not just an emotion.
It should not cause us alter our viewpoint on whether a Christian can be demon possessed / demonized.
Blasphemy is also attributing some evil to God or denying Him some good that we should attribute to Him.
Depression is often triggered by life circumstances, such as a loss of job, death of a loved one, divorce, or psychological problems such as abuse or low self-esteem.
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
Sometimes God forces us to wait for an answer to our prayers in order to teach us patience and perseverance.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
Another way of expressing this same basic thought is when people say, “The God of the Old Testament is a God of wrath while the God of the New Testament is a God of love.” The fact that the Bible is God’s progressive revelation of Himself to us through historical events and through His relationship with people throughout history might contribute to misconceptions about what God is like in the Old Testament as compared to the New Testament.
                                                                                         Answer
All humans, from Adam to Moses, were subject to death, not because of their sinful acts against the Mosaic Law (which they did not have), but because of their own inherited sinful nature.
God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and His existence will never end.
“For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink” (1 Corinthians 12:13).
and all the brothers with me, to the churches in Galatia.” Here we see that in the province of Galatia there were many churches—they had a localized ministry and were scattered throughout the province.
It is unthinkable that God would allow one of His children, whom He purchased with the blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18-19) and made into a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), to be possessed and controlled by a demon.
'Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man’s blood.'
We are also told in 1 Corinthians 12:28-31 and in 1 Corinthians 14:12-13 that it is God (not us) who chooses the gifts.
A literal interpretation does not eliminate the possibility of figures of speech being used.
 The substitutionary atonement refers to Jesus Christ dying as a substitute for sinners.
No one comes to the Father except through me."
It is crucially important, though, that we do not allow personal experience to influence our interpretation of Scripture.
“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
 The first thing to understand in this discussion is that there is only one race—the human race.
Another verse that deals with the inspiration of the Scriptures is 2 Peter 1:21.
By modern value systems and worldly human viewpoint, that is called “sexist.” God ordained the order in society, not man, and He is the author of the establishment principles of authority.
Angels are spirit beings (Hebrews 1:14) without true physical bodies.
This is not God’s intent.
 Scripture has much to say regarding the drinking of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3; Deuteronomy 29:6; Judges 13:4, 7, 14; Proverbs 20:1; 31:4; Isaiah 5:11, 22; 24:9; 28:7; 29:9; 56:12).
Verses such as Genesis 6:6, “The LORD was grieved that He had made man on the earth, and His heart was filled with pain.” Also, Exodus 32:14 proclaims, “Then the LORD relented and did not bring on His people the disaster He had threatened.” These verses speak of the Lord “repenting” or “relenting” of something and seem to contradict the doctrine of God’s immutability.
Romans 3:10 proclaims, "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one."
This brings us to Proverbs 22:6, “Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.” To “train” indicates the first instruction that a father and mother give to a child, i.e., his early education.
We also know from Scripture that it is at this judgment when the dead will be “judged according to what they had done” (Revelation 20:12) and that “anyone’s name” that is not “found written in the book of life” will be “thrown into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:15).
God does not show partiality or favoritism (Deuteronomy 10:17; Acts 10:34; Romans 2:11; Ephesians 6:9), and neither should we.
 First of all, no matter what view one takes on the issue of divorce, it is important to remember Malachi 2:16: “I hate divorce, says the LORD God of Israel.” According to the Bible, marriage is a lifetime commitment.
Other things may be open to debate, such as who wrote the book of Hebrews or the nature of Paul’s “thorn in the flesh.” We should avoid becoming bogged down in disputations over secondary matters (2 Timothy 2:23; Titus 3:9).
We have all done things that are displeasing to God, which makes us deserving of punishment.
 Ephesians 5:3 tells us, “But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity...because these are improper for God’s holy people.” Anything that even “hints” of sexual immorality is inappropriate for a Christian.
Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
God created the angels, just as He created humanity.
The Case for the Real Jesus by Lee Strobel
Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse.
Since Jesus was in the grave for part of Friday, all of Saturday, and part of Sunday—He could be considered to have been in the grave for three days.
                                                                                         Answer
Our eternal security is purchased by Christ, promised by the Father, and sealed by the Holy Spirit.
Neither does God need or want money that was “stolen” from the poor in the temptation for riches.
Renamed Satan, he brought sin to the human race in the Garden of Eden, where he tempted Adam and Eve with the same enticement, “you shall be like God.” Genesis 3 describes Adam and Eve’s rebellion against God and against His command.
Jesus always had been God (John 8:58, 10:30), but at the incarnation Jesus became a human being (John 1:14).
Jesus’ resurrection proves that God accepted Jesus’ death as the payment for our sins.
It describes the glorious nature of the resurrection body we will receive (1 Corinthians 15:35-49).
He will equip us with whatever gift or gifts we need to accomplish the task He has called us to.
 The sinner’s prayer is a prayer a person prays to God when they understand that they are a sinner and in need of a Savior.
The filioque clause controversy likely involves an aspect of God’s person that we will never be able to fully grasp.
4) Learn to possess your body in holiness (1 Thessalonians 4:3-4).
To walk in the Spirit is to be filled with the Spirit, and some results of the Spirit’s filling are thankfulness, singing, and joy (Ephesians 5:18–20; Colossians 3:16).
Fourth, the feeling of “self-edification” is natural.
If anyone claims that God has spoken to him or her, always compare what is said with what the Bible says.
8) “You shall not steal.” This is a command against taking anything that is not one’s own, without the permission of the person to whom it belongs.
John 14:26 tells us, “But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name...” John 15:26 tells us, “When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, He will testify about me.” See also John 14:16 and Philippians 1:19.
Perhaps the person truly is a Christian but is severely demon oppressed and/or suffering from severe psychological problems.
                                                                                         Answer
Biblical interpretation would devolve into “what this passage says to me” instead of “the Bible says.” Sadly, this is already the case in much of what is called Bible study today.
Once we are saved and belong to God, the Spirit takes up residence in our hearts forever, sealing us with the confirming, certifying, and assuring pledge of our eternal state as His children.
 Availability – morning, noon, and night (Deuteronomy 6:6-7)
In 2 Timothy 2:5, Paul says, “Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor’s crown unless he competes according to the rules.” Paul uses an athletic analogy again in 2 Timothy 4:7: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” While the focus of these Scriptures is not physical exercise, the fact that Paul uses athletic terminology to teach us spiritual truths indicates that Paul viewed physical exercise, and even competition, in a positive light.
                                                                                         Answer
Rather, they are different ethnicities of the human race.
A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.
 What does it mean to be a born again Christian?
The same people who saw God part the Red Sea later doubted whether God was able to conquer the inhabitants of the Promised Land.
The Passover was the most sacred feast of the Jewish religious year.
The internal evidences are those things within the Bible that testify of its divine origin.
Predestination is the biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved.
The Bible tells us to be filled with joy and praise (Philippians 4:4; Romans 15:11), so God apparently intends for us all to live joyful lives.
 They praise God (Psalm 148:1-2; Isaiah 6:3).
A second common objection is that Paul only restricted the women of Ephesus from teaching men (1 Timothy was written to Timothy, the pastor of the church in Ephesus).
Jesus was God in the flesh (John 1:1, 14) so when people saw Him, they were seeing God.
He would either be a lunatic—on a level with a man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of hell.
Faith in Christ is the key to going to heaven.
                                                                                         Answer
However, believers have been freed from the eternal penalty of sin—hell and spiritual death—but now we also have the power to resist sinning.
Being single should not be viewed as a curse or punishment, but as an opportunity to serve God wholeheartedly (1 Corinthians 7:32-36).
A Corinthian believer would speak in tongues, proclaiming God’s truth to someone who spoke that language, and then that believer, or another believer in the church, was to interpret what was spoken so that the entire assembly could understand what was said.
Church is the place where believers can love one another (1 John 4:12), encourage one another (Hebrews 3:13), “spur” one another to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), serve one another (Galatians 5:13), instruct one another (Romans 15:14), honor one another (Romans 12:10), and be kind and compassionate to one another (Ephesians 4:32).
Those who accept Jesus’ sacrifice as the payment for their sins and who believe in His resurrection are going to heaven.
Instead, be filled with the Spirit” (Ephesians 5:18).
 The word "forgive" means to wipe the slate clean, to pardon, to cancel a debt.
In John 8:58 Jesus claims pre-existence, an attribute of God: “‘I tell you the truth,’ Jesus answered, ‘before Abraham was born, I am!’” In response to this statement, the Jews again took up stones to stone Jesus (John 8:59).
It gives instructions on how slaves should be treated (Deuteronomy 15:12-15; Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 4:1), but does not outlaw slavery altogether.
Through faith in Christ, we can be free from sin’s consequences, and ultimately free from sin itself.
As a result, it seems that praying in tongues was offering a prayer to God.
There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” If some of our loved ones are not in heaven, we will be in 100 percent complete agreement that they do not belong there and that they are condemned by their own refusal to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior (John 3:16; 14:6).
“If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
Commentator Matthew Henry wrote, “The woman was made out of Adam’s side.
1 John 2:2 proclaims, "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."
A possible explanation is that they may have been counting since Wednesday evening at Christ’s burial, which begins the Jewish Thursday, and Thursday to Sunday could be counted as three days.
                                                                                         Answer
 The great white throne judgment is described in Revelation 20:11-15 and is the final judgment prior to the lost being cast into the lake of fire.
 What does it mean to accept Jesus as your personal Savior?
Beginning on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit began permanently indwelling believers (Acts 2).
 Questions about Jesus Christ
Any and all sexual and pre-sexual activity should be restricted to married couples.
One of the first internal evidences that the Bible is truly God’s Word is seen in its unity.
God has given us wonderful promises concerning prayer (Matthew 7:7-11; Luke 18:1-8; John 6:23-27; 1 John 5:14-15), and Paul includes prayer in his passage on preparing for spiritual battle (Ephesians 6:18).
                                                                                         Answer
The Bible says that people reject this knowledge, and therefore God is just in condemning them to hell.
The story is recorded in Exodus 12.
 Julius Africanus quotes the historian Thallus in a discussion of the darkness that followed the crucifixion of Christ (Extant Writings, 18).
Revelation 20:2-7 gives the precise time period of the millennial kingdom.
So, how can we evangelize our family members, friends, co-workers, and acquaintances?
In fact, the New Testament teaches the opposite.
Just as a mother bears a child during pregnancy, and just as a mother feeds and cares for a child during infancy, so mothers also play an ongoing role in the lives of their children, whether they are adolescents, teenagers, young adults, or even adults with children of their own.
 What are the communicable and incommunicable attributes of God?
These have come so that your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.”
Corporate prayer edifies and unifies us as we share our common faith.
Exodus 20:4-5 says, “You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
God did not get married and have a son.
                                                                                         Answer
As He broke it and gave it to His disciples, He said, “‘This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you’” (Luke 22:19-21).
If Christ were not raised, then where is His body?
When a wife is loved by her husband as the church is loved by Christ, submission is not difficult.
It can be very easy to “fall in love” with someone, but there are some questions to ask before deciding if what we are feeling is true love.
He replied, “I wish that someone would have told me that when you reach the top, there’s nothing there.” Many goals reveal their emptiness only after years have been wasted in their pursuit.
Second Corinthians 6:14 (KJV) tells us not to be “unequally yoked” with an unbeliever.
This is essentially treating the words “in Jesus’ name” as a magic formula.
The church, made up of all who have trusted in the person and work of the Lord Jesus to save them from being punished for sin, will not be present during the tribulation.
The extent of inspiration can be clearly seen in 2 Timothy 3:16, “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.” This verse tells us that God inspired all Scripture and that it is profitable to us.
The Bible makes it clear that we have all sinned.
(2 Corinthians 5:17).
Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life.
The three primary views are pre-tribulational (the rapture occurs before the tribulation), mid-tribulational (the rapture occurs at or near the mid-point of the tribulation), and post-tribulational (the rapture occurs at the end of the tribulation).
God possibly blessed this line with especially long life as a result of their godliness and obedience.
By considering creation’s vastness, complexity, beauty, and order, we can have a sense of the awesomeness of God.
That is what systematic theology is all about—organizing the teachings of the Bible into categorical systems.
The question we must ask ourselves is how can we know that the Bible is the Word of God and not just a good book?
Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—His good, pleasing and perfect will.” This passage gives us an important sequence: the child of God refuses to be conformed to the world and instead allows himself to be transformed by the Spirit.
 Demanding “proof” of God that no one could ever reject is unreasonable.
                                                                                         Answer
The Holy Spirit assists believers in prayer (Jude 1:20) and “intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God” (Romans 8:27).
    What does it mean that Jesus is the Son of Man?
The fact that believers are predestined (Romans 8:29-30; Ephesians 1:5, 11) and elected for salvation (Romans 9:11, 11:28; 2 Peter 1:10) is clear.
Yet, each time He would deliver them once they had repented of their idolatry.
Other possible signs would include a rebuilding of a Jewish temple in Jerusalem, increased hostility toward Israel, and advances toward a one-world government.
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres” (1 Corinthians 13:4-7).
 Jesus Christ declared that He “did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45).
Further study of the New Testament clarifies that the intent of this religion was to point to the need for a Savior-Messiah (Galatians 3; Romans 7).
Suppose you were standing before God right now and He asked you, “Why should I let you into heaven?” What would you say?
We are told that every believer in Christ has the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 1:13-14), but not every believer speaks in tongues (1 Corinthians 12:29-31).
The Bible describes the role of the human conscience in Romans 2:14-16: “Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.
Because of his sin, God permanently removed Satan from his exalted position and role.
However, in some instances, such as the protection of our own rights (as in the example of the apostle Paul), it may be appropriate to pursue a legal solution.
 Questions about Humanity
Every born-again believer has the indwelling Holy Spirit.
 Some see in Hebrews 12:1 the idea that people in heaven might be able to look down and see us: “Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses.
Others understand the Holy Spirit as the impersonal power that God makes available to followers of Christ.
There is also daily forgiveness as we confess our sins and forsake them for our sanctification.
How complex is the DNA “code” that we carry in every cell of our bodies?
The second list is the “fruit of the Spirit” (verses 22-23).
The marriage between a man and a woman is a picture of the relationship between Christ and the church.
While God could speak audibly to people today, He speaks primarily through His written Word.
 The Bible, God’s Word, tells us what God is like and what He is not like.
It was the death of Jesus on the cross that sufficiently provided for our redemption.
Sometimes we ask for something when granting it is not yet in God’s timing for our lives.
Peter strikes a good balance between having the answer and having humility: “Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.
The seven “deadly” sins are pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth.
The judgment side of sheol/hades has remained unchanged.
Psalm 22:14–18 details some of the suffering of the Messiah: “I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint.
And on a wing of the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.” The person of whom this verse speaks is the person Jesus calls the “abomination that causes desolation” (Matthew 24:15) and is called “the beast” in Revelation 13.
We should be so familiar with God’s Word that when someone speaks error to us, it is clear that it is not of God.
Ephesians 2:8–9 teaches, “It is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.” We are saved by God’s grace, and grace, by definition, cannot be earned.
He leads in the way we should go in all spiritual things.
Those who oppose the filioque clause object because they believe the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son makes the Holy Spirit “subservient” to the Father and Son.
 Questions about the Church
Faith in Christ prepares us for life after death: “Whoever believes in [God’s Son] is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son” (John 3:18).
The imagery is of two incompatible oxen sharing the same yoke.
                                                                                         Answer
Therefore honor God with your body” (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).
Yes, as believers, we wage war with Satan and his demons, but not from within ourselves.
then I will relent.” Conversely, God may tell a nation they will be blessed, but “if it does evil in my sight [like Israel in Micah 1] .
“This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe” (Romans 3:22).
Christ then judges all unbelievers (Revelation 20:10-15) at the great white throne judgment, casting them all into the lake of fire.
As Christians, we have the Holy Spirit producing His fruit in us and we have the Holy Spirit’s power available to conquer the acts of the sinful nature (2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).
Another statement Paul made that is not included in the gospel accounts is “For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes” (1 Corinthians 11:26).
Full verbal plenary inspiration is an essential characteristic of the Word of God.
Thus, those who walk in the Spirit walk in love—they live in love for God and for their fellow man.
The prosperity gospel movement closely resembles some of the destructive greed sects that infiltrated the early church.
Romans 8:1 teaches us, "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
                                                                                         Answer
The Holy Spirit is the means by whom the Father does the following works: creation and maintenance of the universe (Genesis 1:2; Job 26:13; Psalm 104:30); divine revelation (John 16:12-15; Ephesians 3:5; 2 Peter 1:21); salvation (John 3:6; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:2); and Jesus’ works (Isaiah 61:1; Acts 10:38).
To better explain, here is a paraphrase of 1 Peter 3:18–20: “Jesus was put to death in the flesh, but He was made alive in the Spirit (it was through this same Spirit that Jesus long ago preached to those who are right now in prison—those souls who disobeyed during the time of God’s great patience when Noah was building the ark).” According to this view, Jesus preached spiritually to the people of Noah’s time, and He did this through the prophet Noah, in much the same way that God speaks through us today when we proclaim God’s Word.
Salvation is available only through faith in Jesus Christ.
Perspectives on Tithing: 4 Views by David A. Croteau
So, again, the Lord’s Prayer is not a prayer we are to memorize and recite back to God.
 Demanding “proof” of God that no one could ever reject is unreasonable.
We make many important decisions based on this emotion, and even get married because we feel that we are “in love.” This may be the reason about half of all first marriages end in divorce.
                                                                                         Answer
For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.” The fall of humanity into sin had effects on everything, including the world we inhabit.
The Bible clearly teaches that the Holy Spirit is God (Acts 5:3-4).
Every worldview, Christian and non-Christian, deals with at least these three questions:
Second Corinthians 5:10 tells us, “We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.” In context, it is clear that both passages refer to Christians, not unbelievers.
 Yes, pride, envy, etc., are sins that the Bible condemns; however, they are never called “the seven deadly sins” in the Bible.
And the choice is clear: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on him” (John 3:36).
A “common” form of the Greek language (different from classical Greek) was the trade language and was spoken throughout the empire, making it possible to communicate the gospel to many different people groups through one common language.
The councils followed something similar to the following principles to determine whether a New Testament book was truly inspired by the Holy Spirit: 1) Was the author an apostle or have a close connection with an apostle?
He sent the Savior, He provided the sacrifice to take away your sin (John 1:29), and He offers you the promise: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Acts 2:21).
Often, people doubt God’s existence because they do not understand or agree with the things He does and allows.
 The Bible records the creation of marriage in Genesis 2:23–24: “The man said, ‘This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called “woman,” for she was taken out of man.’ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.” God created man and then made woman to complement him.
                                                                                         Answer
Jesus pointed out that these laws were given because of the hardness of people’s hearts, not because such laws were God’s desire (Matthew 19:8).
Calvinism holds to perseverance of the saints while Arminianism holds to conditional salvation.
The rest of Ephesians 5 gives us the characteristics of a Spirit-filled believer.
He then awaited the resurrection of His body and His return to glory in His ascension.
The greatest expression of God’s love is communicated to us in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Romans 5:8 proclaims the same message: “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” We can see from these verses that it is God’s greatest desire that we join Him in His eternal home, heaven.
If this is the case, Spirit baptism is the reality for every believer, just as “one faith” and “one Father” are.
In the Gospels, the Pharisees and Sadducees are depicted as the representatives of organized religion at the time of Christ.
“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh” (Ephesians 5:31).
The Bible teaches that there is no other way to salvation than through Jesus Christ.
What is important is that He did die and that He physically, bodily rose from the dead.
                                                                                         Answer
Genesis 2:16-17, “And the LORD God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.’” If God had not given Adam and Eve the choice, they would have essentially been robots, simply doing what they were programmed to do.
While there are different views as to the extent to which the Bible is inspired, there can be no doubt that the Bible itself claims that every word in every part of the Bible comes from God (1 Corinthians 2:12-13; 2 Timothy 3:16-17).
Because Jesus Christ was human, He could die; and because Jesus Christ was God, His death had an eternal and infinite value.
 There is a great deal of confusion in regards to this question.
You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.” Far from speaking things into existence in the future, we do not even know what tomorrow will bring or even whether we will be alive.
God calls these groups of organized believers “churches.” The descriptions from the book of Acts and the Epistles indicate that the church is to be organized and interdependent.
Son of Man is a title of humanity. Other titles for Christ, such as Son of God, are overt in their focus on His deity.
He is an accuser (Revelation 12:10), a tempter (Matthew 4:3; 1 Thessalonians 3:5), and a deceiver (Genesis 3; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Revelation 20:3).
The rapture of the church is a glorious event we should all be longing for.
Thus, we come full circle: God created us to have fellowship with Him; man sinned, breaking that fellowship; God restores that fellowship fully in the eternal state.
                                                                                         Answer
Pray that God would change their hearts and open their eyes to the truth of the gospel (2 Corinthians 4:4).
Jesus said: “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
He assumed he would no longer be considered a son (verse 19), but he was wrong.
The Christian faith is a relationship with God because of what He has done for us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
Belief in God does not require blind faith (John 20:29), but neither can it overcome malicious resistance (John 5:39–40).
 Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has to do with accusing Jesus Christ of being demon-possessed instead of Spirit-filled.
But some claim that a mandate by Constantine in A.D. 321 “changed” the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday.
However, this sacrificial system was only temporary and merely looked forward to the coming of Jesus Christ who would die on the cross to make a complete substitutionary atonement for sin.
God looks at things from a holy, eternal perspective.
Because Christians have received Jesus as the Savior, they are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace to find help in time of need (Hebrews 4:14-16).
It is correct that the Bible never records Jesus saying the precise words, “I am God.” This does not mean, however, that Jesus never claimed to be God.
Dispensationalists hold to a literal interpretation of the Bible as the best hermeneutic.
God imputed Christ’s righteousness to those who humbly ask for forgiveness of sin (Isaiah 53:5-6; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” Hebrews 13:5 declares, “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’” Matthew 6:24 proclaims, “No one can serve two masters.
We can ignore it, but we do so to our own detriment, just as we would if we ignored the law of gravity.
                                                                                         Answer
The positive part of Ephesians 6:4 is expressed in a comprehensive direction—educate them, bring them up, develop their conduct in all of life by the instruction and admonition of the Lord.
Another explanation is that Adam and Eve possessed the genes to produce black, brown, and white offspring (and everything else in between).
This particular type of blasphemy cannot be duplicated today.
 Crucial Questions
Converting to Christianity is receiving the gift that God offers and beginning a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that results in the forgiveness of sins and eternity in Heaven after death.
Both are gifts from God.
 Questions about the Christian Life

Too often, the focus of fasting is on the lack of food.
It is the job of the church leaders to help build up the saints so they can be further equipped for the ministry to which God has called them.
In these verses, Jesus is reinforcing the accuracy of the Scriptures down to the smallest detail and the slightest punctuation mark, because it is the very Word of God.
The first “canon” was the Muratorian Canon, which was compiled in AD 170.
                                                                                         Answer
He will come in and go out, and find pasture” (John 10:9).
To ignore God’s merciful love, to reject Christ, or to deny the Savior who bought us (2 Peter 2:1) is to subject ourselves to God’s wrath for eternity (Romans 1:18), not His love.
“There is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 14:3).
If a person truly desires to know God, God will make Himself known.
He said His words are life (John 6:63).
If a person claims to be a believer, but has no good works in his/her life, then he/she likely does not have genuine faith in Christ (James 2:14, 17, 20, 26).
This is not easy for someone suffering from situational depression, but it can be remedied through God’s gifts of prayer, Bible study and application, support groups, fellowship among believers, confession, forgiveness, and counseling.
And while Jesus was truly a good teacher and a prophet, those job descriptions do not capture who Jesus truly is, nor do they explain how or why Jesus saves.
A crucial part of the truth He reveals is that Jesus is who He said He is (John 15:26; 1 Corinthians 12:3).
Chapters 12–14 of 1 Corinthians deal primarily with the subject of the gifts of the Spirit.
                                                                                         Answer
                                                                                         Answer
 The real meaning of life, both now and in eternity, is found in the restoration of our relationship with God.
The Bible doesn’t specifically say that people in heaven cannot look down on us, so we can’t be dogmatic.
This should cause us to compare even more carefully our experiences with Scripture.
God enabled the Gentiles to speak in tongues to demonstrate that they had received the same Holy Spirit the apostles had received (Acts 10:47, 11:17).
 Questions about Humanity
There are also external evidences that indicate the Bible is truly the Word of God.
However, humanity brought sin into the world, and is therefore separated from God.
First, studying the context is immensely valuable.
It seems that God imprisoned the fallen angels who committed this evil sin, so that the other fallen angels would not do the same (as described in Jude 6).
The Muratorian Canon included all of the New Testament books except Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, and 3 John.
                                                                                         Answer
 The Lord’s Prayer is a prayer the Lord Jesus taught His disciples in Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4.
 Crucial Questions
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
The prophet Isaiah wrote of Him in Isaiah 53:2-6, describing Him as a man who was “despised and rejected” by everyone.
Most of us are pretty well bloodied, bruised, and battle-scarred.
God does not require or demand it of Christians.
The Bible is the tool the Spirit uses in our lives (Ephesians 6:17), an essential and major part of the armor that God gives us to fight our spiritual battles (Ephesians 6:12-18).
• If Jesus is not God, then the apostles would likewise have been liars.
Second, many of the cults and world religions also report occurrences of speaking in tongues/praying in tongues.
 In the above passage, we not only find the word “all” being used repeatedly, but we also find “all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered,” “the waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet,“ and “every living thing that moved on the earth perished.” These descriptions clearly describe a universal flood covering the whole earth.
The first example of military service is found in the Old Testament (Genesis 14), when Abraham’s nephew Lot was kidnapped by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and his allies.
There is no biblical reason why God could not speak to a person audibly today.
A common misconception about the seven deadly sins is that they are sins that God will not forgive.
We pray in preparation for major decisions (Luke 6:12-13); to overcome demonic barriers (Matthew 17:14-21); to gather workers for the spiritual harvest (Luke 10:2); to gain strength to overcome temptation (Matthew 26:41); and to obtain the means of strengthening others spiritually (Ephesians 6:18-19).
The second aspect of a sinner’s prayer is knowing what God has done to remedy our lost and sinful condition.
God’s unconditional love is related to His general call to salvation and what is often called His permissive or perfect will—that aspect of God’s will that reveals His attitude and defines what is pleasing to Him.
 Is there a conclusive argument for the existence of God?
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
“So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature … Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:16, 25).
It is not uncommon today for people to believe that two diametrically opposed religions could both be equally “true,” even though both religions claim to have the only way to heaven or teach two totally opposite “truths.” People who do not believe in absolute truth ignore these claims and embrace a more tolerant universalism that teaches all religions are equal and all roads lead to heaven.
In John 8:58 Jesus claims pre-existence, an attribute of God: “‘I tell you the truth,’ Jesus answered, ‘before Abraham was born, I am!’” In response to this statement, the Jews again took up stones to stone Jesus (John 8:59).
At that moment, the Holy Spirit gives to the new believer the spiritual gift(s) He desires the believer to have (1 Corinthians 12:11).
While we hold that the baptism of the Spirit also occurs at the moment of salvation, some Christians do not.
However, full preterism has some serious flaws in that it denies the physical reality of Christ’s second coming and downplays the dreadful nature of the tribulation by restricting that event to the fall of Jerusalem.
The question logically comes, "Why does a person need to be born again?"
For example, the Bible makes the claim that “man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment” (Hebrews 9:27), while some Eastern religions teach reincarnation.
Later, the only survivors of the flood were Noah and his wife, Noah’s three sons and their wives—eight people in all (Genesis 7:13).
God calls these groups of organized believers “churches.” The descriptions from the book of Acts and the Epistles indicate that the church is to be organized and interdependent.
This is a tough world and life is difficult.

The Palestinian Covenant promised Israel a restoration to the land and occupation of the land (Deuteronomy 30:1–10).
                                                                                         Answer
Confirmation from others also gives light to our spiritual giftedness.
There is no pride (all is received by grace—Ephesians 2:8-9).
If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.” Then in 1 Corinthians 2:10-11, we see the characteristic of omniscience in the Holy Spirit.
All of His creation put together cannot thwart His purposes (Psalm 93:1; 95:3; Jeremiah 23:20).
They point to the fact that the result of this judgment is the same as what is seen after the great white throne judgment in Revelation 20:11-15.
As finite human beings, we can never fully understand an infinite God (Romans 11:33-34).
Adam believed Him, demonstrated by the name he gave Eve (v. 20) and the Lord indicated His acceptance immediately by covering them with coats of skin (v. 21).
The Bible says, for example, that we are to “make the most of every opportunity” (Colossians 4:5).
Ecclesiastes 7:20 proclaims, "There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins."
Lastly, the Lord Jesus Christ believed in the universal flood and took it as the type of the coming destruction of the world when He returns (Matthew 24:37-39; Luke 17:26-27).
The book of Acts records believers fasting before they made important decisions (Acts 13:2; 14:23).
As the Apostle Paul said, this thing “was not done in a corner” (Acts 26:26).

 Questions about Sin

Another way of expressing this same basic thought is when people say, “The God of the Old Testament is a God of wrath while the God of the New Testament is a God of love.” The fact that the Bible is God’s progressive revelation of Himself to us through historical events and through His relationship with people throughout history might contribute to misconceptions about what God is like in the Old Testament as compared to the New Testament.

Verses such as Genesis 6:6, “The LORD was grieved that He had made man on the earth, and His heart was filled with pain.” Also, Exodus 32:14 proclaims, “Then the LORD relented and did not bring on His people the disaster He had threatened.” These verses speak of the Lord “repenting” or “relenting” of something and seem to contradict the doctrine of God’s immutability.

For example, David, in his defeat of Goliath, teaches us that God is greater than anything He asks us to face (1 Samuel 17), while his giving in to the temptation to commit adultery with Bathsheba reveals just how long-lasting and terrible the consequences of a moment’s sinful pleasure can be (2 Samuel 11).
With 483 years having passed from the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the cutting off of the Messiah, this leaves one seven-year period to be fulfilled in terms of Daniel 9:24: “to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.” This final seven-year period is known as the tribulation period—it is a time when God finishes judging Israel for its sin.

The wine spoke of His blood, indicating the terrible death He would soon experience.
For instance, Acts 20:7 states that “on the first day of the week we came together to break bread.” In 1 Corinthians 16:2 Paul urges the Corinthian believers “on the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income.” Since Paul designates this offering as “service” in 2 Corinthians 9:12, this collection must have been linked with the Sunday worship service of the Christian assembly.
Those who hold to peccability believe that, if Jesus could not have sinned, He could not have truly experienced temptation, and therefore could not truly empathize with our struggles and temptations against sin.

Throughout the Old Testament, believers came to salvation because they believed that God would someday take care of their sin problem.
We grieve the Spirit by living like the pagans (4:17-19), by lying (4:25), by being angry (4:26-27), by stealing (4:28), by cursing (4:29), by being bitter (4:31), by being unforgiving (4:32), and by being sexually immoral (5:3-5).
Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith “it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.” God is spirit (John 4:24) so He cannot be seen or touched.
Paul, speaking to the synagogue in Antioch, singled out Jesus as the Savior: “I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.

The Spirit-Filled Life: Discovering the Joy of Surrendering to the Holy Spirit by Charles Stanley
Verses such as Genesis 6:6, “The LORD was grieved that He had made man on the earth, and His heart was filled with pain.” Also, Exodus 32:14 proclaims, “Then the LORD relented and did not bring on His people the disaster He had threatened.” These verses speak of the Lord “repenting” or “relenting” of something and seem to contradict the doctrine of God’s immutability.
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand" (John 10:28-29b).

There is no good reason to believe that Jesus Christ (or any other man for that matter) could survive such an ordeal, fake His death, sit in a tomb for three days and nights without medical attention, food or water, remove the massive stone which sealed His tomb, escape undetected (without leaving behind a trail of blood), convince hundreds of eyewitnesses that He was resurrected from the death and in good health, and then disappear without a trace.

Second, angels study the Bible and the world more thoroughly than humans do and gain knowledge from it (James 2:19; Revelation 12:12).
In fact, we can almost reconstruct the gospel just from early non-Christian sources: Jesus was called the Christ (Josephus), did “magic,” led Israel into new teachings, and was hanged on Passover for them (Babylonian Talmud) in Judea (Tacitus), but claimed to be God and would return (Eliezar), which his followers believed, worshiping Him as God (Pliny the Younger).

For example, Romans 8:9 tells us, “…if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.” This verse very clearly states that if someone does not have the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, then that person is not saved.
 While certain ministries of the Holy Spirit may involve a feeling, such as conviction of sin, comfort, and empowerment, Scripture does not instruct us to base our relationship with the Holy Spirit on how or what we feel.

In these examples, the Bible does seem to indicate that we will be recognizable after death.
When the apostle Paul wrote to the Romans, he was under the government of Rome during the reign of Nero, perhaps the most evil of all the Roman emperors.
This is the Holy Spirit’s fruit, and it is exhibited by the born-again believer who is under His control.
In verses 25 and 26, Daniel is told that the Messiah will be cut off after “seven sevens and sixty-two sevens” (69 total), beginning with the decree to rebuild Jerusalem.
This prayer would minister to someone who spoke that language, but would also need to be interpreted so that the entire body could be edified.
The term comes from a Latin word meaning “a carrying off, a transport, or a snatching away.” The concept of the “carrying off” or the rapture of the church is clearly taught in Scripture.

 Questions about Marriage
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
The inability to have children when they are desired is always presented in Scripture as a bad thing, especially considering the cultural stigma attached to childlessness at that time.

The night of His arrest, as Jesus prayed in Gethsemane, He committed His all to the task: “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done” (Luke 22:42).
These two facts seem contradictory to us, but in the mind of God they make perfect sense.
We have to first understand the problem that is keeping us from heaven.
The Holy Spirit is the means by whom the Father does the following works: creation and maintenance of the universe (Genesis 1:2; Job 26:13; Psalm 104:30); divine revelation (John 16:12-15; Ephesians 3:5; 2 Peter 1:21); salvation (John 3:6; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:2); and Jesus’ works (Isaiah 61:1; Acts 10:38).

 Questions about Salvation
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor…to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve…to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.”
We should not be surprised, then, if much evidence of Jesus’ existence was destroyed.
The Christian men and women who serve their country with character, dignity, and honor can rest assured that the civic duty they perform is condoned and respected by our sovereign God.
A living Savior or one of many dead "prophets"?
The Bible tells us to flee immorality, not expose ourselves to constant temptations to immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18).
Samuel heard the voice of God, but did not recognize it until he was instructed by Eli (1 Samuel 3:1–10).
Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” Hebrews 13:5 declares, “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’” Matthew 6:24 proclaims, “No one can serve two masters.

We are to obey the government in everything—paying taxes, obeying rules and laws, and showing respect.
We are to use our money to help others, but with discernment and the guidance of God’s Spirit.
Can we get married to each other?” Questions like these are very difficult to answer because the Bible does not go into great detail regarding the various scenarios for remarriage after a divorce.
Death in the Scriptures refers to a “separation.” Everyone will die, but some will live in heaven with the Lord for eternity, while others will live a life in hell for eternity.
 The Bible mentions six specific people who committed suicide: Abimelech (Judges 9:54), Saul (1 Samuel 31:4), Saul’s armor-bearer (1 Samuel 31:4–6), Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17:23), Zimri (1 Kings 16:18), and Judas (Matthew 27:5).
Samuel heard the voice of God, but did not recognize it until he was instructed by Eli (1 Samuel 3:1–10).

Does God forgive divorce?
That leaves us with 1 Corinthians 14:4-17 and verse 14 especially: “For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.” First Corinthians 14:14 distinctly mentions “praying in tongues.” What does this mean?

The soul, as with the spirit, is the center of many spiritual and emotional experiences (Job 30:25; Psalm 43:5; Jeremiah 13:17).
                                                                                         Answer
The same promise is reiterated in Matthew 7:7-11 and in Luke 11:13, where the “good gift” is further explained to be the Holy Spirit.

One of the arguments for Intelligent Design, irreducible complexity, is defined as “a single system which is composed of several well-matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.” Simply put, life is comprised of intertwined parts that rely on each other in order to be useful.
God the Son Incarnate: The Doctrine of Christ by Stephen Wellum
Earlier Hebrew interpreters and apocryphal and pseudopigraphal writings are unanimous in holding to the view that fallen angels are the “sons of God” mentioned in Genesis 6:1-4.
In other words, if we want to live life to the fullest, as God intended, we must listen to and heed God’s written Word.
Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.
A determined Christian who strives to learn the Word and develop his teaching ability may become a better teacher than one who may have the spiritual gift of teaching, but who neglects the gift.

Jesus’ death was an infinite death, paying our infinite sin debt so that we would not have to pay it in hell for eternity (2 Corinthians 5:21).
If you place your faith in Jesus, trusting His death as the payment for your sins, all of your sins are forgiven and washed away.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your forgiveness.
The egg (or apple) fails in that the shell, white, and yolk are parts of the egg, not the egg in themselves, just as the skin, flesh, and seeds of the apple are parts of it, not the apple itself.
Perseverance of the saints refers to the concept that a person who is elected by God will persevere in faith and will not permanently deny Christ or turn away from Him.
In Matthew 16:15-16, Jesus asks, “Who do you say I am?” Peter answers, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” and for this answer Peter is called “blessed.” In 2 John 9, we read, “Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.” In other words, Jesus Christ and His work of redemption is of utmost importance; beware of anyone who denies that Jesus is equal with God, who downplays Jesus’ sacrificial death, or who rejects Jesus’ humanity.
For example, throughout the Old Testament, God is declared to be a “compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,” (Exodus 34:6; Numbers 14:18; Deuteronomy 4:31; Nehemiah 9:17; Psalm 86:5, 15; 108:4; 145:8; Joel 2:13).

There should be no prejudice (we are all one in Christ—Galatians 3:28).
Often, this question is posed as “Can you prove God exists?” The problem is that, while truth itself is absolute, there are virtually zero instances of absolute proof outside of pure logic and mathematics.
As we seek to serve God out of love for the purpose of building up others for His glory, He will bring glory to His name, grow His church, and reward us (1 Corinthians 3:5-8, 12:31–14:1).

This contradicts countless scriptures which declare salvation to be received by grace through faith (John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5).
A true sinner’s prayer only represents what a person knows, understands, and believes about their sinfulness and need for salvation.

People have testified that, while they achieved their goals of wealth, relationships, and pleasure, there was still a deep void inside, a feeling of emptiness that nothing seemed to fill.
Rather than desiring to heap riches upon ourselves, the biblical model is one of giving, not getting.
