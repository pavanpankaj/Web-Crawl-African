The early church “devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer” (Acts 2:42).
At the judgment seat of Christ, these believers will be rewarded for good works and faithful service during their time on earth or will lose rewards, but not eternal life, for lack of service and obedience (1 Corinthians 3:11-15; 2 Corinthians 5:10).
Our responsibility is to take the gospel to the world (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8).
Similarly, darkness does not exist; it is the absence of light.
What did they believe?
Jesus proved His power over death; therefore, we need to hear what He says.
There is no one who is not affected by the harsh realities of life, and the question “why do bad things happen to good people?” is one of the most difficult questions in all of theology.
 Scripture presents conclusive evidence that Jesus Christ was in fact resurrected from the dead.
 When people come to know Christ as their Savior, they are brought into a relationship with God that guarantees their eternal security.
“There is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 14:3).
The Muratorian Canon included all of the New Testament books except Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, and 3 John.
The Greek words for “woman” and “man” in 1 Timothy 2 could refer to husbands and wives; however, the basic meaning of the words is broader than that.
But God has made a way to not only make eternal bliss possible (Luke 23:43) but also life on earth satisfying and meaningful.
However, passages such as 1 Corinthians 15:50-54 and 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 describe believers being resurrected and given glorified bodies.
For example, His omnipresence is seen in Psalm 139:7-8, “Where can I go from your Spirit?
This passage speaks of 70 weeks that have been declared against “your people.” Daniel’s people are the Jews, the nation of Israel, and Daniel 9:24 speaks of a period of time that God has given “to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.” God declares that “seventy sevens” will fulfill all these things.
The Lord’s Supper/Christian Communion is a remembrance of what Christ did for us and a celebration of what we receive as a result of His sacrifice.
If we cannot give God glory for something, we should not do it.
He performed countless acts of compassion and public miracles to authenticate His message and bear witness to His deity (John 21:24-25).
The conclusion is that if God needed a cause, then God is not God (and if God is not God, then of course there is no God).
Here, after commanding Sabbath observance in verses 12–14, Moses gives the reason the Sabbath was given to the nation Israel: “Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.
As He broke it and gave it to His disciples, He said, “‘This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you’” (Luke 22:19-21).

Jesus, during His earthly ministry, encountered many demons.
These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ” (Colossians 2:16–17).
 How can Jesus be God, when Numbers 23:19 says that God is not a man or a son of man?
Our eternal security is a result of God keeping us, not us maintaining our own salvation.
If Christ fulfilled some of it, such as the sacrificial system, He fulfilled all of it.
 God can also “speak” to us through events—i.e., He can guide us through arranging our circumstances.
Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death.
John 1:12, 13 indicates that being "born again" also carries the idea of "becoming children of God" through trust in the name of Jesus Christ.
As Mark 3:29 puts it, “They are guilty of an eternal sin.”
There are both internal and external evidences that the Bible is truly God’s Word.
Focusing on the rules and rituals of a religion is the problem.
Peter does not tell us what Jesus proclaimed to the imprisoned spirits, but it could not have been a message of redemption, since angels cannot be saved (Hebrews 2:16).
 The Old Testament Law commanded the Israelites not to engage in interracial marriage (Deuteronomy 7:3–4).
The lights will be turned on.
They definitely had many more children later (Genesis 5:4).
                                                                                         Answer
While we might see one aspect of His nature revealed in certain passages of Scripture more than other aspects, God Himself does not change.
We should read and study the Bible because God does not change and because mankind’s nature does not change; it is as relevant for us as it was when it was written.
Beyond that, the fundamental content of human morals remains constant throughout history and across cultures.
Seeing the risen Christ had a tremendous impact on them.
We should expect some minor differences.
Eternal security is not a license to sin.
Because of this, it will be a time of obedience (Jeremiah 31:33), holiness (Isaiah 35:8), truth (Isaiah 65:16), and the knowledge of God (Isaiah 11:9, Habakkuk 2:14).
The church is to be a place that promotes prayer, teaches prayer, and practices prayer.
What is preventing us from having an abundant life?
It simply means “the place of the dead” or “the place of departed souls/spirits.” The New Testament Greek equivalent of sheol is hades, which also refers to “the place of the dead.” Other Scriptures in the New Testament indicate that sheol/hades is a temporary place, where souls are kept as they await the final resurrection and judgment.
Spiritual gift tests or inventories, while not to be fully relied upon, can definitely help us understand where our gifting might be.
Therefore, honor God with your body” (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).
                                                                                         Answer
Further, God does not need our money to fund His mission in the world.
An examination of New Testament passages shows us four important points: 1) Whenever Christ appears in His resurrected form and the day is mentioned, it is always the first day of the week (Matthew 28:1, 9, 10; Mark 16:9; Luke 24:1, 13, 15; John 20:19, 26).
And God helps us to discern right from wrong through our consciences (1 Timothy 1:5; 1 Peter 3:16).
When Jesus declared, “I and the Father are one,” He was saying that He and the Father are of one nature and essence.
.
Suicide, the taking of one’s own life, is ungodly because it rejects God’s gift of life.
The second reason is biblical.
The character of those we are around will “rub off” on us.
 A true Christian is a person who has put faith and trust in the person and work of Jesus Christ, including His death on the cross as payment for sins and His resurrection on the third day.
And it is in learning this that we are drawn to love Him in return (1 John 4:19).
The gift of prophecy enabled believers to communicate new truth and revelation from God.
These facts have significance related to the meaning of life.
Does God Exist?
   Return to:
 Within the Christian faith, there is a significant amount of confusion regarding what happens after death.
The teleological argument examines the structure of the universe.
If done with absolutely no lust, immoral thoughts, or pornography, with full assurance that it is good and right, with thanks given to God for the pleasure it brings (see 1 Corinthians 10:30), is it still a sin to masturbate?
No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him” (1 John 3:6).
Based on the watch’s design, I would assume it had a designer.
Christian baptism is the means by which a person makes a public profession of faith and discipleship.
The New Testament does not say anything about whether or not a believer in Jesus Christ should get a tattoo.
Compared to the New Testament, there was much less controversy over the canon of the Old Testament.
Unbelievers, then, are not sent to hell (the lake of fire) immediately after death, but rather are in a temporary realm of judgment and condemnation.
Through Jesus Christ we can have a relationship of peace with God.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
People are responsible to God for what God has already revealed to them.
So, if God is a “something,” then He must have a cause, right?
Satan was created as a holy angel.
We can also know that the Holy Spirit is God because He possesses the characteristics of God.
Therefore, any breaking of that bond by sexual relations outside of marriage might be a permissible reason for divorce.
Yes, there are verses that appear to contradict each other.
Sex within marriage is pleasurable, and God designed it that way.
This is simply an area which our finite minds cannot understand concerning the infinite God.
There are at least two reasons why literalism is the best way to view Scripture.
    Is remarriage after divorce always adultery?
Olw'ebibi byaffe , tugwaniira okubonerezebwa n'ekibonerezo eky'okwawukana ne Katonda emirembe gyonna.
If people who never hear the gospel are automatically saved, then it is logical to make sure no one ever hears the gospel—because then there would be a chance they will reject it and be condemned.
The abodes of the saved and the lost are separated by a “great chasm” (Luke 16:26).
The doctrine of the Trinity has been a divisive issue throughout the entire history of the Christian church.
This does not make women less important, by any means, but rather gives them a ministry focus more in agreement with God’s plan and His gifting of them.
Concepts such as the Big Bang Theory demonstrate, at the very least, the scientific validity of a created, non-eternal universe.
“Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
The Jewish leaders understood exactly what Jesus meant by the phrase “Son of God.” To be the Son of God is to be of the same nature as God.
Even when adultery is committed, a couple can, through God’s grace, learn to forgive and begin rebuilding their marriage.
The Holy Spirit is sovereign in the dispersion of the spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12:11).
It is correct that the Bible never records Jesus saying the precise words, “I am God.” This does not mean, however, that Jesus never claimed to be God.
While the core aspects of the Trinity are clearly presented in God’s Word, some of the side issues are not as explicitly clear.
We need the encouragement that church attendance affords.
There are women who believe women should not serve as pastors and that the Bible places restrictions on the ministry of women, and there are men who believe women can serve as pastors and that there are no restrictions on women in ministry.
Jesus fulfilled many of the prophecies of the Messiah during His birth, life, ministry, death, and resurrection.
 What is the law of Christ?
In His triumph, Jesus had defeated and taken captive our spiritual enemies: the devil, death, and the curse of sin.
The psalmist talks about its life-changing power in-depth in Psalm 119.
 Questions about Sin
Thus, we come full circle: God created us to have fellowship with Him; man sinned, breaking that fellowship; God restores that fellowship fully in the eternal state.
“We know that when he [Christ] appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).
According to the Bible, God’s forgiveness is available to the homosexual just as it is to the adulterer, idol worshiper, murderer, and thief.
Where can I flee from your presence?
However, there are some prophecies regarding the Messiah that Jesus has not yet fulfilled.
 The Bible tells us we need to attend church so we can worship God with other believers and be taught His Word for our spiritual growth.
The third of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Jesus Christ is God’s only provision for our sin.
(e) John 3:15 states that whoever believes in Jesus Christ will "have eternal life."
Or it may mean to allow the ceremony to become a dead and formal ritual or to come to the Lord’s Supper with unconfessed sin.
Taking all of these prophecies and organizing them can be difficult.
5) There is subordination within the Trinity.
Both are valid meanings of the Greek word translated “from.” However, it is important to recognize what believers are promised to be kept from.
The greatest expression of God’s love is communicated to us in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Romans 5:8 proclaims the same message: “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” We can see from these verses that it is God’s greatest desire that we join Him in His eternal home, heaven.
Likewise, God does not spend much time proving His existence in His book.
In other words, some of the Corinthians, before they were saved, lived homosexual lifestyles; but no sin is too great for the cleansing power of Jesus.
After looking at the evidence, one can say without a doubt that, yes, the Bible is truly God’s Word.
How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
Yet, if they were not exactly as they are, complex matter—and life—would be impossible.

Consumption of small quantities of alcohol is a matter of Christian freedom.
New Testament Teaching on Tongues by Merrill Unger
Paul repeatedly mentions how he prayed for those he ministered to.
 Questions about Salvation

We give token service to it by carrying our Bibles to church or reading a daily devotional or a chapter a day, but we fail to memorize it, meditate on it, or apply it to our lives; we fail to confess the sins it reveals or praise God for the gifts it reveals to us.
If so, Jesus is the way of salvation!
They believed that their unity was more important than their relationship with God.
From these brief accounts we learn how Jesus used two of the frailest of elements as symbols of His body and blood and established them as a monument to His death.

So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal” (2 Corinthians 4:16–18).
Why does it matter whether Jesus is God?
Tithing/giving is intended to be a joy and a blessing.
God has promised that as we make use of His resources, He will progressively bring about change in our lives.
There is no pride (all is received by grace—Ephesians 2:8-9).
The church is also to equip believers in Christ with the tools they need to overcome sin and remain free from the pollution of the world.

 A dictionary definition of “religion” would be something similar to “belief in God or gods to be worshiped, usually expressed in conduct and ritual; any specific system of belief, worship, etc., often involving a code of ethics.” In light of this definition, the Bible does speak of organized religion, but in many cases the purpose and impact of “organized religion” are not something that God is pleased with.
As the Bible’s story of God’s redemptive plan for humanity unfolds, many different characters are vividly described.
The words translated “predestined” in the Scriptures referenced above are from the Greek word proorizo, which carries the meaning of “determining beforehand,” “ordaining,” “deciding ahead of time.” So, predestination is God determining certain things to occur ahead of time.

Believer’s Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ by Schriener and Wright
In order to understand and interpret the passages in Scripture that deal with end-times events, there are two things that must be clearly understood: a proper method of interpreting Scripture and the distinction between Israel (the Jews) and the church (the body of all believers in Jesus Christ).

How does that come to be?
Again, it is crucial to remember that the church did not determine the canon.
Never before in the history of the world (and never since) had so much divine light been granted to men; if anyone should have recognized Jesus for who He was, it was the Pharisees.
Every worldview, Christian and non-Christian, deals with at least these three questions:

To better explain, here is a paraphrase of 1 Peter 3:18–20: “Jesus was put to death in the flesh, but He was made alive in the Spirit (it was through this same Spirit that Jesus long ago preached to those who are right now in prison—those souls who disobeyed during the time of God’s great patience when Noah was building the ark).” According to this view, Jesus preached spiritually to the people of Noah’s time, and He did this through the prophet Noah, in much the same way that God speaks through us today when we proclaim God’s Word.
That is one of the primary purposes of the church.
Dogmatic theology is the study of the doctrines of certain Christian groups that have systematized doctrine—for example, Calvinistic theology and dispensational theology.

Song of Solomon and several other Bible passages (such as Proverbs 5:19) clearly describe the pleasure of sex.
Biblical historians confirm that 483 years passed from the time of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the time when Jesus was crucified.

 Why do so many Christians not have a consistently biblical worldview?
God promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).
In Deuteronomy 5, Moses restates the Ten Commandments to the next generation of Israelites.

 Genesis 6:1-4 refers to the sons of God and the daughters of men.
Not temporary life, but eternal.
 The word "forgive" means to wipe the slate clean, to pardon, to cancel a debt.

Abstinence saves lives, protects babies, gives sexual relations the proper value, and, most importantly, honors God.
If this is the case, Spirit baptism is the reality for every believer, just as “one faith” and “one Father” are.
The men who wrote the New Testament and many hundreds of other believers (1 Corinthians 15:6) knew the truth of their message because they had seen and spent time with Jesus Christ after He had risen from the dead.
Beyond these core beliefs, there are many other items that are, or at least should be, indicative of what Christianity is and what Christians believe.
Salvation, the forgiveness of sins, is available to anyone who will trust in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
