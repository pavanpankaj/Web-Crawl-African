                                                                                         Answer
 First, it is important to recognize that this is not a question of whether God still performs miracles today.
It would be foolish and unbiblical to claim God does not heal people, speak to people, and perform miraculous signs and wonders today.
The question is whether the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, described primarily in 1 Corinthians 12–14, are still active in the church today.
This is also not a question of can the Holy Spirit give someone a miraculous gift.
The question is whether the Holy Spirit still dispenses the miraculous gifts today.
Above all else, we entirely recognize that the Holy Spirit is free to dispense gifts according to His will (1 Corinthians 12:7-11).
In the book of Acts and the Epistles, the vast majority of miracles are performed by the apostles and their close associates.
Paul gives us the reason why: “The things that mark an apostle—signs, wonders and miracles—were done among you with great perseverance” (2 Corinthians 12:12).
If every believer in Christ was equipped with the ability to perform signs, wonders, and miracles, then signs, wonders, and miracles could in no way be the identifying marks of an apostle.
Acts 2:22 tells us that Jesus was “accredited” by “miracles, wonders, and signs.” Similarly, the apostles were “marked” as genuine messengers from God by the miracles they performed.
Acts 2:22 tells us that Jesus was “accredited” by “miracles, wonders, and signs.” Similarly, the apostles were “marked” as genuine messengers from God by the miracles they performed.
Acts 14:3 describes the gospel message being “confirmed” by the miracles Paul and Barnabas performed.
Chapters 12–14 of 1 Corinthians deal primarily with the subject of the gifts of the Spirit.
It seems from that text “ordinary” Christians were sometimes given miraculous gifts (12:8-10, 28-30).
We are not told how commonplace this was.
From what we learned above, that the apostles were “marked” by signs and wonders, it would seem that miraculous gifts being given to “ordinary” Christians was the exception, not the rule.
Beside the apostles and their close associates, the New Testament nowhere specifically describes individuals exercising the miraculous gifts of the Spirit.
It is also important to realize that the early church did not have the completed Bible, as we do today (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
Therefore, the gifts of prophecy, knowledge, wisdom, etc.
The gift of prophecy enabled believers to communicate new truth and revelation from God.
Now that God’s revelation is complete in the Bible, the “revelatory” gifts are no longer needed, at least not in the same capacity as they were in the New Testament.
God miraculously heals people every day.
God still does amazing miracles, signs, and wonders and sometimes performs those miracles through a Christian.
God still does amazing miracles, signs, and wonders and sometimes performs those miracles through a Christian.
However, these things are not necessarily the miraculous gifts of the Spirit.
The primary purpose of the miraculous gifts was to prove that the gospel was true and that the apostles were truly God’s messengers.
The Bible does not say outright that the miraculous gifts have ceased, but it does lay the foundation for why they might no longer occur to the same extent as they did as recorded in the New Testament.

Are Miraculous Gifts for Today - Four Views edited by Wayne Grudem
                                                                                         Answer
 First, let’s define “aliens” as “beings capable of making moral choices, having intellect, emotion, and a will.” Next, a few scientific facts:
After observing these planets, we have ruled out all but Mars and possibly a moon of Jupiter as being able to support life.
In contrast, if you analyzed soil from the most barren desert on earth or the most frozen dirt in Antarctica, you would find it teeming with micro-organisms.
Knowing that Earth alone supports life in our solar system, evolutionists want very badly to find another planet in another solar system to support the notion that life must have evolved.
Acts 17:24-26 states that “the God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands…he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.”
After observing these planets, we have ruled out all but Mars and possibly a moon of Jupiter as being able to support life.
The earth and mankind are unique in God’s creation.
The fact is that none of these has ever been proven to be anything close to a life-supporting planet.
The tremendous distance between Earth and these planets makes it impossible to make any judgments regarding their ability to sustain life.
It is important to also note that Christ came to die for mankind and that He died only once (Hebrews 7:27; 9:26-28; 10:10).
If, for the sake of argument, moral beings do exist on other planets, then they also suffer; and if not now, then someday they will surely suffer when everything passes away with a great noise and the elements melt with fervent heat (2 Peter 3:10).
But it would certainly prove problematic when trying answer questions like “Since all of creation suffers, what purpose would God have in creating non-moral and non-sentient creatures to suffer on distant planets?”
If, for the sake of argument, moral beings do exist on other planets, then they also suffer; and if not now, then someday they will surely suffer when everything passes away with a great noise and the elements melt with fervent heat (2 Peter 3:10).

 Calvinism and Arminianism are two systems of theology that attempt to explain the relationship between God’s sovereignty and man’s responsibility in the matter of salvation.
Calvinism is named for John Calvin, a French theologian who lived from 1509-1564.
Arminianism is named for Jacobus Arminius, a Dutch theologian who lived from 1560-1609.
Both systems can be summarized with five points.
Calvinism holds to the total depravity of man while Arminianism holds to partial depravity.
Calvinism’s doctrine of total depravity states that every aspect of humanity is corrupted by sin; therefore, human beings are unable to come to God on their own accord.
Partial depravity states that every aspect of humanity is tainted by sin, but not to the extent that human beings are unable to place faith in God of their own accord.
Calvinism includes the belief that election is unconditional, while Arminianism believes in conditional election.
Unconditional election is the view that God elects individuals to salvation based entirely on His will, not on anything inherently worthy in the individual.
Conditional election states that God elects individuals to salvation based on His foreknowledge of who will believe in Christ unto salvation, thereby on the condition that the individual chooses God.
Calvinism sees the atonement as limited, while Arminianism sees it as unlimited.
Partial depravity states that every aspect of humanity is tainted by sin, but not to the extent that human beings are unable to place faith in God of their own accord.
Limited atonement is the belief that Jesus only died for the elect.
Unlimited atonement is the belief that Jesus died for all, but that His death is not effectual until a person receives Him by faith.
Calvinism includes the belief that God’s grace is irresistible, while Arminianism says that an individual can resist the grace of God.
Irresistible grace argues that when God calls a person to salvation, that person will inevitably come to salvation.
Resistible grace states that God calls all to salvation, but that many people resist and reject this call.
Calvinism holds to perseverance of the saints while Arminianism holds to conditional salvation.
Perseverance of the saints refers to the concept that a person who is elected by God will persevere in faith and will not permanently deny Christ or turn away from Him.
Conditional salvation is the view that a believer in Christ can, of his/her own free will, turn away from Christ and thereby lose salvation.
It is interesting to note that in the diversity of the body of Christ, there are all sorts of mixtures of Calvinism and Arminianism.
There are five-point Calvinists and five-point Arminians, and at the same time three-point Calvinists and two-point Arminians.
Calvinism includes the belief that God’s grace is irresistible, while Arminianism says that an individual can resist the grace of God.
Ultimately, it is our view that both systems fail in that they attempt to explain the unexplainable.
Unconditional election is the view that God elects individuals to salvation based entirely on His will, not on anything inherently worthy in the individual.
Calvinism includes the belief that God’s grace is irresistible, while Arminianism says that an individual can resist the grace of God.
Yes, human beings are called to make a genuine decision to place faith in Christ unto salvation.
These two facts seem contradictory to us, but in the mind of God they make perfect sense.

 While the Bible does not explicitly state whether a Christian can be possessed by a demon, related biblical truths make it abundantly clear that Christians cannot be demon possessed.
 While the Bible does not explicitly state whether a Christian can be possessed by a demon, related biblical truths make it abundantly clear that Christians cannot be demon possessed.
Demon possession involves a demon having direct/complete control over the thoughts and/or actions of a person (Matthew 17:14-18; Luke 4:33-35; 8:27-33).
Demon oppression or influence involves a demon or demons attacking a person spiritually and/or encouraging him/her into sinful behavior.
Notice that in all the New Testament passages dealing with spiritual warfare, there are no instructions to cast a demon out of a believer (Ephesians 6:10-18).
Believers are told to resist the devil (James 4:7; 1 Peter 5:8-9), not to cast him out.
Christians are indwelt by the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:9-11; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 6:19).
Surely the Holy Spirit would not allow a demon to possess the same person He is indwelling.
It is unthinkable that God would allow one of His children, whom He purchased with the blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18-19) and made into a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), to be possessed and controlled by a demon.
Yes, as believers, we wage war with Satan and his demons, but not from within ourselves.
The apostle John declares, “You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the One who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world” (1 John 4:4).
With the strong biblical evidence that a Christian cannot be demon possessed in view, some Bible teachers use the term “demonization” to refer to a demon having control over a Christian.

With the strong biblical evidence that a Christian cannot be demon possessed in view, some Bible teachers use the term “demonization” to refer to a demon having control over a Christian.
Some argue that while a Christian cannot be demon possessed, a Christian can be demonized.
Typically, the description of demonization is virtually identical to the description of demon possession.
So, the same issue results.
Changing the terminology does not change the fact that a demon cannot inhabit or take full control of a Christian.
Demonic influence and oppression are realities for Christians, no doubt, but it is simply not biblical to say that a Christian can be possessed by a demon or demonized.
Much of the reasoning behind the demonization concept is the personal experience of seeing someone who was “definitely” a Christian exhibiting evidence of being controlled by a demon.
It is crucially important, though, that we do not allow personal experience to influence our interpretation of Scripture.
Rather, we must filter our personal experiences through the truth of Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
Seeing someone whom we thought to be a Christian exhibiting the behavior of being demonized should cause us to question the genuineness of his/her faith.
It should not cause us alter our viewpoint on whether a Christian can be demon possessed / demonized.
Perhaps the person truly is a Christian but is severely demon oppressed and/or suffering from severe psychological problems.
But again, our experiences must meet the test of Scripture, not the other way around.

 The word “monotheism” comes from two words, “mono” meaning “single” and “theism” meaning “belief in God.” Specifically, monotheism is the belief in one true God who is the only creator, sustainer, and judge of all creation.
There are many arguments for monotheism, including those from special revelation (Scripture), natural revelation (philosophy), as well as historical anthropology.
Biblical arguments for Monotheism - Deuteronomy 4:35: “You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides Him there is no other.” Deuteronomy 6:4: “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.” Malachi 2:10a, “Have we not all one Father?
Did not one God create us?” 1 Corinthians 8:6: “Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.” Ephesians 4:6: “One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.” 1 Timothy 2:5: “For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” James 2:19: “You believe that there is one God.

Unfortunately, in an article this short it would be impossible to argue for these basic metaphysical positions and then go on to show what they point to regarding monotheism, but rest assured that there are strong philosophical and theological grounds for these truths that go back millennia (and most are fairly self-evident).
A similar argument would be the beliefs and teaching of Jesus Christ, who proved that He was God (or at the very least approved by God) by His miraculous birth, life, and the miracle of His resurrection.
The popular evolutionary theory of religious development stems from an evolutionary view of reality in general, and the presupposition of evolutionary anthropology which sees “primitive” cultures as representing the earlier stages of religious development.
What we find is a monotheistic God who is personal, masculine, lives in the sky, has great knowledge and power, created the world, is the author of a morality to which we are accountable, and whom we have disobeyed and are thus estranged from, but who has also provided a way of reconciliation.

If there were more than one God, the universe would be in disorder because of multiple creators and authorities, but it is not in disorder; therefore, there is only one God.
This does not hurt the case for monotheism, which does not say that there cannot be any other spirit beings—only that there cannot be more than one God.

Many of these depend a great deal on one’s metaphysical position concerning the nature of reality.

 Some see in Hebrews 12:1 the idea that people in heaven might be able to look down and see us: “Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses.
Their Old Testament stories give testimony to the blessings of choosing faith over fear.
The proper interpretation of Hebrews 12:1 is that the men and women forming the “great cloud of witnesses” are witness to the value of living life by faith.
The proper interpretation of Hebrews 12:1 is that the men and women forming the “great cloud of witnesses” are witness to the value of living life by faith.
.” The “witnesses” are the heroes of faith listed in Hebrews 11, and the fact that we are “surrounded” by them leads some commentators to understand those heroes (and possibly other people) are looking down on us from heaven.
The record of their lives bears witness to faith and God and truth.
Hebrews 12:1 continues, “Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.” Because of the faith and endurance of believers who went before us, we are inspired to stay the course in our own race of faith.

The Bible doesn’t specifically say that people in heaven cannot look down on us, so we can’t be dogmatic.

Examples are Joseph, son of Jacob (Genesis 37:5–10); Joseph, the husband of Mary (Matthew 2:12–22); Solomon (1 Kings 3:5–15); and several others (Daniel 2:1; 7:1; Matthew 27:19).
This is not to say that God does not work miracles or even speak through dreams today, but anything God says, whether through a dream, vision, impression, or “still small voice,” will agree completely with what He has already revealed in His Word.
In Scripture, whenever anyone experienced a dream from God, God always made the meaning of the dream clear, whether directly to the person, through an angel, or through another messenger (Genesis 40:5–11; Daniel 2:45; 4:19).

The book of Acts records believers fasting before they made important decisions (Acts 13:2; 14:23).
God does not require or demand it of Christians.
At the same time, the Bible presents fasting as something that is good, profitable, and beneficial.
The book of Acts records believers fasting before they made important decisions (Acts 13:2; 14:23).
Fasting and prayer are often linked together (Luke 2:37; 5:33).
Too often, the focus of fasting is on the lack of food.
Instead, the purpose of fasting should be to take your eyes off the things of this world to focus completely on God.
Fasting is a way to demonstrate to God, and to ourselves, that we are serious about our relationship with Him.
Fasting helps us gain a new perspective and a renewed reliance upon God.
Although fasting in Scripture is almost always a fasting from food, there are other ways to fast.
Anything given up temporarily in order to focus all our attention on God can be considered a fast (1 Corinthians 7:1-5).
Fasting should be limited to a set time, especially when fasting from food.
Extended periods of time without eating can be harmful to the body.
Fasting is not intended to punish the flesh, but to redirect attention to God.
Fasting should not be considered a “dieting method” either.
The purpose of a biblical fast is not to lose weight, but rather to gain deeper fellowship with God.
Anyone can fast, but some may not be able to fast from food (diabetics, for example).
Everyone can temporarily give up something in order to draw closer to God.
By taking our eyes off the things of this world, we can more successfully turn our attention to Christ.
Fasting is not a way to get God to do what we want.
Fasting changes us, not God.
Fasting is not a way to appear more spiritual than others.
Fasting is to be done in a spirit of humility and a joyful attitude.
Matthew 6:16-18 declares, “When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting.
But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.”
Matthew 6:16-18 declares, “When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting.

Both sides agree, as the Bible clearly says, that Jesus did not sin (2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 2:22).
You probably have no desire whatsoever to take part in these actions, but you were still tempted because someone placed the possibility before you.
It is against His very nature (Matthew 4:1; Hebrews 2:18, 4:15; James 1:13).
You probably have no desire whatsoever to take part in these actions, but you were still tempted because someone placed the possibility before you.
 1) To have a sinful proposition suggested to you by someone or something outside yourself or by your own sin nature.
2) To consider actually participating in a sinful act and the possible pleasures and consequences of such an act to the degree that the act is already taking place in your mind.
Those who hold to peccability believe that, if Jesus could not have sinned, He could not have truly experienced temptation, and therefore could not truly empathize with our struggles and temptations against sin.

God the Son Incarnate: The Doctrine of Christ by Stephen Wellum
                                                                                         Answer
 At first it might seem that if God created all things, then evil must have been created by God.
However, evil is not a “thing” like a rock or electricity.
You cannot have a jar of evil.
Evil has no existence of its own; it is really the absence of good.
For example, holes are real but they only exist in something else.
We call the absence of dirt a hole, but it cannot be separated from the dirt.
 At first it might seem that if God created all things, then evil must have been created by God.
One of the good things God made was creatures who had the freedom to choose good.
In order to have a real choice, God had to allow there to be something besides good to choose.
So, God allowed these free angels and humans to choose good or reject good (evil).
When a bad relationship exists between two good things we call that evil, but it does not become a “thing” that required God to create it.
Perhaps a further illustration will help.
If a person is asked, “Does cold exist?” the answer would likely be “yes.” However, this is incorrect.
Similarly, darkness does not exist; it is the absence of light.
Similarly, darkness does not exist; it is the absence of light.
Cold is the absence of heat.
Similarly, darkness does not exist; it is the absence of light.
Evil is the absence of good, or better, evil is the absence of God.
God did not create evil, but He does allow evil.
God did not create evil, but He does allow evil.
If God had not allowed for the possibility of evil, both mankind and angels would be serving God out of obligation, not choice.
He did not want “robots” that simply did what He wanted them to do because of their “programming.” God allowed for the possibility of evil so that we could genuinely have a free will and choose whether or not we wanted to serve Him.
He did not want “robots” that simply did what He wanted them to do because of their “programming.” God allowed for the possibility of evil so that we could genuinely have a free will and choose whether or not we wanted to serve Him.
As finite human beings, we can never fully understand an infinite God (Romans 11:33-34).
Sometimes we think we understand why God is doing something, only to find out later that it was for a different purpose than we originally thought.
God looks at things from a holy, eternal perspective.
We look at things from a sinful, earthly, and temporal perspective.
Why did God put man on earth knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and therefore bring evil, death, and suffering on all mankind?
What we can know is whatever God does is holy and perfect and ultimately will glorify Him.
If He had not allowed evil, we would be worshiping Him out of obligation, not by a choice of our own will.

: A New Way to Think about the Question by Norman Geisler

 There is a great deal of confusion in regards to this question.
The concept that Jesus went to hell after His death on the cross comes primarily from the Apostles’ Creed, which states, “He descended into hell.” There are also a few Scriptures which, depending on how they are translated, describe Jesus going to “hell.” In studying this issue, it is important to first understand what the Bible teaches about the realm of the dead.

In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word used to describe the realm of the dead is sheol.
In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word used to describe the realm of the dead is sheol.
It simply means “the place of the dead” or “the place of departed souls/spirits.” The New Testament Greek equivalent of sheol is hades, which also refers to “the place of the dead.” Other Scriptures in the New Testament indicate that sheol/hades is a temporary place, where souls are kept as they await the final resurrection and judgment.

Revelation 20:11–15 gives a clear distinction between hades and the lake of fire.
The lake of fire is the permanent and final place of judgment for the lost.
Hades, then, is a temporary place.
When Jesus died, He went to the blessed side of sheol and, from there, took the believers with Him to heaven (Ephesians 4:8–10).
Sheol/hades was a realm with two divisions—a place of blessing and a place of judgment (Matthew 11:23; 16:18; Luke 10:15; 16:23; Acts 2:27–31).
The abode of the saved is also called “Abraham’s bosom” (KJV) or “Abraham’s side” (NIV) in Luke 16:22 and “paradise” in Luke 23:43.
The abodes of the saved and the lost are separated by a “great chasm” (Luke 16:26).
When Jesus died, He went to the blessed side of sheol and, from there, took the believers with Him to heaven (Ephesians 4:8–10).
The judgment side of sheol/hades has remained unchanged.
All unbelieving dead go there awaiting their final judgment in the future.
Yes, according to Ephesians 4:8–10 and 1 Peter 3:18–20.
Some of the confusion has arisen from such passages as Psalm 16:10–11 as translated in the King James Version: “For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Thou wilt show me the path of life.” “Hell” is not a correct translation in this verse.
Unfortunately, in many versions of the Bible, translators are not consistent, or correct, in how they translate the Hebrew and Greek words for “sheol,” “hades,” and “hell.”
A correct reading would be “the grave” or “sheol.” Jesus said to the thief beside Him, “Today you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43); He did not say, “I will see you in hell.” Jesus’ body was in the tomb; His soul/spirit went to be with the blessed in sheol/hades.

This imputation of sin helps us understand Christ’s struggle in the garden of Gethsemane with the cup of sin which would be poured out upon Him on the cross.

 Typically, when this question is asked, the person asking qualifies the question with “outside of the Bible.” We do not grant this idea that the Bible cannot be considered a source of evidence for the existence of Jesus.
 Typically, when this question is asked, the person asking qualifies the question with “outside of the Bible.” We do not grant this idea that the Bible cannot be considered a source of evidence for the existence of Jesus.
The New Testament contains hundreds of references to Jesus Christ.
There are those who date the writing of the Gospels to the second century A.D., more than 100 years after Jesus’ death.
Even if this were the case (which we strongly dispute), in terms of ancient evidences, writings less than 200 years after events took place are considered very reliable evidences.
Further, the vast majority of scholars (Christian and non-Christian) will grant that the Epistles of Paul (at least some of them) were in fact written by Paul in the middle of the first century A.D., less than 40 years after Jesus’ death.
In terms of ancient manuscript evidence, this is extraordinarily strong proof of the existence of a man named Jesus in Israel in the early first century A.D.
It is also important to recognize that in A.D. 70, the Romans invaded and destroyed Jerusalem and most of Israel, slaughtering its inhabitants.
Entire cities were literally burned to the ground.
We should not be surprised, then, if much evidence of Jesus’ existence was destroyed.
Many of the eyewitnesses of Jesus would have been killed.
These facts likely limited the amount of surviving eyewitness testimony of Jesus.
Considering that Jesus’ ministry was largely confined to a relatively unimportant area in a small corner of the Roman Empire, a surprising amount of information about Jesus can be drawn from secular historical sources.

Some of the more important historical evidences of Jesus include the following:
 The first-century Roman Tacitus, who is considered one of the more accurate historians of the ancient world, mentioned superstitious “Christians” (from Christus, which is Latin for Christ), who suffered under Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius.
Suetonius, chief secretary to Emperor Hadrian, wrote that there was a man named Chrestus (or Christ) who lived during the first century (Annals 15.44).
Flavius Josephus is the most famous Jewish historian.
In his Antiquities he refers to James, “the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ.” There is a controversial verse (18:3) that says, “Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man.

For he was one who wrought surprising feats....He was [the] Christ...he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him.” One version reads, “At this time there was a wise man named Jesus.
 Julius Africanus quotes the historian Thallus in a discussion of the darkness that followed the crucifixion of Christ (Extant Writings, 18).
Pliny the Younger, in Letters 10:96, recorded early Christian worship practices including the fact that Christians worshiped Jesus as God and were very ethical, and he includes a reference to the love feast and Lord’s Supper.
But those who became his disciples did not abandon his discipleship.
The Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a) confirms Jesus’ crucifixion on the eve of Passover and the accusations against Christ of practicing sorcery and encouraging Jewish apostasy.
He said that Jesus’ teachings included the brotherhood of believers, the importance of conversion, and the importance of denying other gods.
Christians lived according to Jesus’ laws, believed themselves to be immortal, and were characterized by contempt for death, and renunciation of material goods.

The Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a) confirms Jesus’ crucifixion on the eve of Passover and the accusations against Christ of practicing sorcery and encouraging Jewish apostasy.
Lucian of Samosata was a second-century Greek writer who admits that Jesus was worshiped by Christians, introduced new teachings, and was crucified for them.
In fact, we can almost reconstruct the gospel just from early non-Christian sources: Jesus was called the Christ (Josephus), did “magic,” led Israel into new teachings, and was hanged on Passover for them (Babylonian Talmud) in Judea (Tacitus), but claimed to be God and would return (Eliezar), which his followers believed, worshiping Him as God (Pliny the Younger).
Mara Bar-Serapion confirms that Jesus was thought to be a wise and virtuous man, was considered by many to be the king of Israel, was put to death by the Jews, and lived on in the teachings of His followers.
Then we have all the Gnostic writings (The Gospel of Truth, The Apocryphon of John, The Gospel of Thomas, The Treatise on Resurrection, etc.)

Perhaps the greatest evidence that Jesus did exist is the fact that literally thousands of Christians in the first century AD, including the twelve apostles, were willing to give their lives as martyrs for Jesus Christ.

The purpose of the Old Testament law is to convict people of our inability to keep the law and point us to our need for Jesus Christ as Savior (Romans 7:7-9; Galatians 3:24).
In place of the Old Testament law, Christians are under the law of Christ (Galatians 6:2), which is to “love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind…and to love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37-39).
Many of the commands in the Old Testament law fall into the categories of “loving God” and “loving your neighbor.” The Old Testament law can be a good guidepost for knowing how to love God and knowing what goes into loving your neighbor.

 Submission is an important issue in relation to marriage.
Here is the plain biblical command: “Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.
Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything” (Ephesians 5:22–24).
Even before sin entered the world, there was still the principle of the headship of the husband (1 Timothy 2:13).
Adam was created first, and Eve was created to be a "helper" for Adam (Genesis 2:18–20).
God has established several types of authority in the world: governments to enforce justice in society and provide protection; pastors to lead and feed the sheep of God; husbands to love and nurture their wives; and fathers to admonish their children.
In each case, submission is required: citizen to government, flock to shepherd, wife to husband, child to father.
The Greek word translated “submit,” hupotasso, is the continuing form of the verb.
This means that submitting to God, the government, a pastor, or a husband is not a one-time act.
It is a continual attitude, which becomes a pattern of behavior.
First, of course, we are responsible to submit to God, which is the only way we can truly obey Him (James 1:21; 4:7).
And each Christian should live in humble, ready submission to others (Ephesians 5:21).
In regards to submission within the family unit, 1 Corinthians 11:2–3, says that the husband is to submit to Christ (as Christ did to God the Father) and the wife is to submit to her husband.
There is much misunderstanding in our world today about the roles of husband and wife within a marriage.
Even when the biblical roles are properly understood, many choose to reject them in favor of a supposed “emancipation” of women, with the result that the family unit is torn apart.
It’s no surprise that the world rejects God’s design, but God’s people should be joyfully celebrating that design.
Submit is not a bad word.
Submission is not a reflection of inferiority or lesser worth.
Christ constantly submitted Himself to the will of the Father (Luke 22:42; John 5:30), without giving up an iota of His worth.
Submission should be a natural response to loving leadership.
When a husband loves his wife as Christ loves the church (Ephesians 5:25—33), then submission is a natural response from a wife to her husband.
But, regardless of the husband’s love or lack thereof, the wife is commanded to submit “as to the Lord” (verse 22).
This means that her obedience to God—her acceptance of His plan—will result in her submission to her husband.
The “as to the Lord” comparison also reminds the wife that there is a higher authority to whom she is responsible.
Thus, she is under no obligation to disobey civil law or God’s law in the name of “submission” to her husband.
She submits in things that are right and lawful and God-honoring.
Of course, she does not “submit” to abuse—that is not right or lawful or God-honoring.
To try to use the principle of “submission” to justify abuse is to twist Scripture and promote evil.
When a wife is loved by her husband as the church is loved by Christ, submission is not difficult.
Ephesians 5:24 says, “Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.” In a marriage, submission is a position of giving honor and respect to the husband (see Ephesians 5:33) and completing what he is lacking in.
It is God’s wise plan for how the family should function.
Commentator Matthew Henry wrote, “The woman was made out of Adam’s side.
She was not made out of his head to rule over him, nor out of his feet to be trampled upon by him, but out of his side to be equal with him, under his arm to be protected, and near his heart to be loved.” The immediate context of the commands to the husband and wife in Ephesians 5:19–33 involves the filling of the Spirit.
Spirit-filled believers are to be worshipful (5:19), thankful (5:20), and submissive (5:21).
Paul then follows this line of thought on Spirit-filled living and applies it to wives in verses 22–24.
A wife should submit to her husband, not because women are inferior (the Bible never teaches that), but because that is how God designed the marital relationship to function.

 Malachi 3:6 declares, “I the LORD do not change.
So you, O descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed.” Similarly, James 1:17 tells us, “Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.” Numbers 23:19 is clear: “God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should change His mind.

Verses such as Genesis 6:6, “The LORD was grieved that He had made man on the earth, and His heart was filled with pain.” Also, Exodus 32:14 proclaims, “Then the LORD relented and did not bring on His people the disaster He had threatened.” These verses speak of the Lord “repenting” or “relenting” of something and seem to contradict the doctrine of God’s immutability.

However, Nineveh repented of their sin (verses 5–9).
First, we can say statements such as “the LORD was grieved that He had made man on the earth” (Genesis 6:6) are examples of anthropopathism (or anthropopatheia).

then I will relent.” Conversely, God may tell a nation they will be blessed, but “if it does evil in my sight [like Israel in Micah 1] .
And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.

Logic demands something eternally existent and that is not itself the effect of anything else.
For that reason, courtrooms don’t require absolute proof to reach a verdict; rather, they seek to dispel “reasonable doubt” and consider what’s “most probable.”
 Demanding “proof” of God that no one could ever reject is unreasonable.
The very idea that human beings think in non-physical, moral terms is striking.
Beyond that, the fundamental content of human morals remains constant throughout history and across cultures.
Empirical data lends credibility to the idea of a biblical Creator and contradicts alternative explanations, such as an eternal universe or abiogenesis.
Human life compels belief that truth, deception, love, hate, goodness, evil, etc., are real and meaningful.
The most reasonable explanation for why people think in moral terms and share moral ideals is a real moral law provided by a Moral Lawgiver, i.e., God.
Bolstering faith are human experience, logic, and empirical evidence, all of which help answer the question does God exist?

Whether or not one acknowledges God, the decision involves faith.
Those who ignore or disdain God’s invitation don’t have the excuse of ignorance (Romans 1:18; Psalm 14:1).
Whether or not one acknowledges God, the decision involves faith.
That’s the essence of biblical faith, including faith in the existence of God.
A personal sense of truth is a compelling way we know God exists, and it’s God’s intent for all people to experience that sense.
Bolstering faith are human experience, logic, and empirical evidence, all of which help answer the question does God exist?
The question does God exist?, therefore, cannot be answered with absolute proof, but we can point to the weight of evidence that suggests He does exist.

The question does God exist?, therefore, cannot be answered with absolute proof, but we can point to the weight of evidence that suggests He does exist.
Logic points to God: the uncreated, eternal measure of all other things, the First Cause of our reality.
Changed lives, reformed attitudes, and answers to prayer are all part of our personal perception that God exists.
Human life compels belief that truth, deception, love, hate, goodness, evil, etc., are real and meaningful.
That’s not to say internal perspective outweighs objective truth, but complex truths are often powerfully supported by individual experiences.
Evidence of God exists in daily human experiences (Romans 1:19–20; Psalm 19:1; Ecclesiastes 3:11).
Accepting the existence of God is not a blind-faith leap into the dark.

 John 9:31 declares, “We know that God does not listen to sinners.
 God does make promises that are applicable to all (saved and unsaved alike) such as Jeremiah 29:13: “You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.” This was the case for Cornelius in Acts 10:1-6.
But in other cases, the prayer was simply for an earthly need or blessing, and God responded either out of compassion or in response to the genuine seeking or the faith of the person.
 The people of Nineveh prayed that Nineveh might be spared (Jonah 3:5-10).
Hagar asked God to protect her son Ishmael (Genesis 21:14-19).
In 1 Kings 21:17-29, especially verses 27-29, Ahab fasts and mourns over Elijah’s prophecy concerning his posterity.
The Gentile woman from the Tyre and Sidon area prayed that Jesus would deliver her daughter from a demon (Mark 7:24-30).
Acts 10:2 tells us that Cornelius “prayed to God regularly.” 
Because Christians have received Jesus as the Savior, they are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace to find help in time of need (Hebrews 4:14-16).
                                                                                         Answer
Cornelius, the Roman centurion in Acts 10, had the apostle Peter sent to him in response to Cornelius being a righteous man.
                                                                                         Answer
God’s love for everyone could be thought of as His “merciful love,” since it results in the fact that God does not immediately punish people for their sins (Romans 3:23; 6:23).
God’s merciful love for the world is also manifested in that God gives people the opportunity to repent: “The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise.
God’s unconditional love is related to His general call to salvation and what is often called His permissive or perfect will—that aspect of God’s will that reveals His attitude and defines what is pleasing to Him.
To ignore God’s merciful love, to reject Christ, or to deny the Savior who bought us (2 Peter 2:1) is to subject ourselves to God’s wrath for eternity (Romans 1:18), not His love.
To ignore God’s merciful love, to reject Christ, or to deny the Savior who bought us (2 Peter 2:1) is to subject ourselves to God’s wrath for eternity (Romans 1:18), not His love.
The unconditional, merciful love God has for everyone should bring us to faith, receiving with gratefulness the conditional, covenant love He grants those who receive Jesus Christ as Savior.
                                                                                         Answer

Examples are Joseph, son of Jacob; Joseph, the husband of Mary; Solomon; Isaiah; Ezekiel; Daniel; Peter; and Paul.
If you believe you have had a vision and feel that perhaps God gave it to you, prayerfully examine the Word of God and make sure your vision is in agreement with Scripture.

The prophet Joel predicted an outpouring of visions, and this was confirmed by the apostle Peter in Acts chapter 2.
                                                                                         Answer
The same people who saw God part the Red Sea later doubted whether God was able to conquer the inhabitants of the Promised Land.
God performed the greatest “God miracle” of all time in coming to earth as the Man Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins (Romans 5:8) so that we could be saved (John 3:16).
No, the Israelites constantly disobeyed and rebelled against God even though they saw all the miracles.
Speaking of the gospel, Hebrews 2:4 proclaims, “God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.” We now have the truth of Jesus recorded in Scripture.
                                                                                         Answer
What we need is to believe in the miracle of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
                                                                                         Answer
 The Bible records God speaking audibly to people many times (Exodus 3:14; Joshua 1:1; Judges 6:18; 1 Samuel 3:11; 2 Samuel 2:1; Job 40:1; Isaiah 7:3; Jeremiah 1:7; Acts 8:26; 9:15—this is just a small sampling).
There is no biblical reason why God could not speak to a person audibly today.
With the hundreds of times the Bible records God speaking, we have to remember that they occur over the course of 4,000 years of human history.
God speaking audibly is the exception, not the rule.
Even in the biblically recorded instances of God speaking, it is not always clear whether it was an audible voice, an inner voice, or a mental impression.
God does speak to people today.
First, God speaks to us through His Word (2 Timothy 3:16–17).
Isaiah 55:11 tells us, “So is my word that goes out from my mouth: it will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.” The Bible is God’s Word, and it contains everything we need to know in order to be saved and live the Christian life.

Second Peter 1:3 declares, “His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us by his own glory and goodness.”
Second Peter 1:3 declares, “His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us by his own glory and goodness.”
God is in the process of conforming our minds to think His thoughts (Romans 12:2).
And God helps us to discern right from wrong through our consciences (1 Timothy 1:5; 1 Peter 3:16).
God is in the process of conforming our minds to think His thoughts (Romans 12:2).
God allows events to occur in our lives to direct us, change us, and help us to grow spiritually (James 1:2–5; Hebrews 12:5–11).
First Peter 1:6–7 reminds us, “In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
These have come so that your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.”
If anyone claims that God has spoken to him or her, always compare what is said with what the Bible says.
It is highly doubtful, though, that this occurs as often as some people claim it does.
These have come so that your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.”
If anyone claims that God has spoken to him or her, always compare what is said with what the Bible says.
If God were to speak today, His words would be in full agreement with what He has said in the Bible (2 Timothy 3:16–17).
God does not contradict Himself.

As those who have been redeemed from the slavery of sin, followers of Jesus Christ should be the foremost champions of ending human slavery in the world today.
It gives instructions on how slaves should be treated (Deuteronomy 15:12-15; Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 4:1), but does not outlaw slavery altogether.
The Bible condemns race-based slavery in that it teaches that all men are created by God and made in His image (Genesis 1:27).
In fact, the penalty for such a crime in the Mosaic Law was death: “Anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be put to death” (Exodus 21:16).
Similarly, in the New Testament, slave-traders are listed among those who are “ungodly and sinful” and are in the same category as those who kill their fathers or mothers, murderers, adulterers and perverts, and liars and perjurers (1 Timothy 1:8– 10).
A person who has experienced God’s gift of salvation and freedom from the slavery of sin, as God reforms his soul, will realize that enslaving another human being is wrong.

The most commonly accepted church tradition in regard to the death of an apostle is that the apostle Peter was crucified upside-down in Rome in fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy (John 21:18).

John faced martyrdom when he was boiled in a huge basin of boiling oil during a wave of persecution in Rome.
He was thrown from the southeast pinnacle of the temple (over a hundred feet down) when he refused to deny his faith in Christ.
The most commonly accepted church tradition in regard to the death of an apostle is that the apostle Peter was crucified upside-down in Rome in fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy (John 21:18).
The fact that all of the apostles were willing to die horrible deaths, refusing to renounce their faith in Christ, is tremendous evidence that they had truly witnessed the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

The Bible states that both man (Genesis 2:7) and animals (Genesis 1:30; 6:17; 7:15, 22) have the “breath of life”; that is, both man and animals are living beings.

Jude 24 declares, "To Him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before His glorious presence without fault and with great joy."
If believers did not have eternal security, the sealing could not truly be unto the day of redemption, but only to the day of sinning, apostasy, or disbelief.
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand" (John 10:28-29b).
Who could possibly separate us from the grip of both the Father and the Son?
The most powerful argument for eternal security is Romans 8:38-39, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

Our eternal security is purchased by Christ, promised by the Father, and sealed by the Holy Spirit.

If eternal security is not true, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in error.
                                                                                         Answer
Peter made a profound statement that resonates even in our postmodern world: “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).
Now as then, Acts 4:12 is not politically correct.
Today it’s popular to say, “Everyone’s going to heaven” or “All paths lead to heaven.” There are many who think they can have heaven without having Jesus.
Faith in Christ is the key to going to heaven.
They may say things like, “My God would never send a person to hell.” But Jesus spoke more about hell than He did about heaven, and He presented Himself as the Savior who offers the only means of going to heaven: “I am the way and the truth and the life.

No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
The Bible makes a clear distinction between those who have eternal life and those who do not: “He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life” (1 John 5:12).
Those who accept Jesus’ sacrifice as the payment for their sins and who believe in His resurrection are going to heaven.

                                                                                         Answer
 The Bible presents a clear path to eternal life.
First, we must recognize that we have sinned against God: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
We have all done things that are displeasing to God, which makes us deserving of punishment.
"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
However, Jesus Christ, the sinless (1 Peter 2:22), eternal Son of God became a man (John 1:1,14) and died to pay our penalty.
"God demonstrates His love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).
Jesus Christ died on the cross (John 19:31-42), taking the punishment that we deserve (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Three days later He rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4), proving His victory over sin and death.
"In His great mercy He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" (1 Peter 1:3).
"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
By faith, we must change our mindset regarding Christ - who He is, what He did, and why - for salvation (Acts 3:19).&nbsp;If we place our faith in Him, trusting His death on the cross to pay for our sins, we will be forgiven and receive the promise of eternal life in heaven.
"For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son so that anyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).
"If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9).
"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, here is a sample prayer.
"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9).
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and deserve punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.

 The term “canon” is used to describe the books that are divinely inspired and therefore belong in the Bible.
The difficulty in determining the biblical canon is that the Bible does not give us a list of the books that belong in the Bible.
Determining the canon was a process conducted first by Jewish rabbis and scholars and later by early Christians.
Ultimately, it was God who decided what books belonged in the biblical canon.
It was simply a matter of God’s convincing His human followers which books should be included in the Bible.
It was simply a matter of God’s convincing His human followers which books should be included in the Bible.
Compared to the New Testament, there was much less controversy over the canon of the Old Testament.
Hebrew believers recognized God’s messengers and accepted their writings as inspired of God.
While there was undeniably some debate in regards to the Old Testament canon, by A.D. 250 there was nearly universal agreement on the canon of Hebrew Scripture.
The only issue that remained was the Apocrypha, with some debate and discussion continuing today.
The vast majority of Hebrew scholars considered the Apocrypha to be good historical and religious documents, but not on the same level as the Hebrew Scriptures.
For the New Testament, the process of the recognition and collection began in the first centuries of the Christian church.
Very early on, some of the New Testament books were being recognized.
Paul considered Luke’s writings to be as authoritative as the Old Testament (1 Timothy 5:18; see also Deuteronomy 25:4 and Luke 10:7).
Peter recognized Paul’s writings as Scripture (2 Peter 3:15-16).
Some of the books of the New Testament were being circulated among the churches (Colossians 4:16; 1 Thessalonians 5:27).
Clement of Rome mentioned at least eight New Testament books (A.D. 95).
Ignatius of Antioch acknowledged about seven books (A.D. 115).
Polycarp, a disciple of John the apostle, acknowledged 15 books (A.D. 108).
Later, Irenaeus mentioned 21 books (A.D. 185).
Hippolytus recognized 22 books (A.D. 170-235).
The New Testament books receiving the most controversy were Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, and 3 John.
The first “canon” was the Muratorian Canon, which was compiled in AD 170.
The Muratorian Canon included all of the New Testament books except Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, and 3 John.
In AD 363, the Council of Laodicea stated that only the Old Testament (along with one book of the Apocrypha) and 26 books of the New Testament (everything but Revelation) were canonical and to be read in the churches.
The Council of Hippo (AD 393) and the Council of Carthage (AD 397) also affirmed the same 27 books as authoritative.
The councils followed something similar to the following principles to determine whether a New Testament book was truly inspired by the Holy Spirit: 1) Was the author an apostle or have a close connection with an apostle?
No early church council decided on the canon.
It was God, and God alone, who determined which books belonged in the Bible.
    How do we decide which books belong in the Bible since the Bible does not say which books belong in the Bible?
The human process of collecting the books of the Bible was flawed, but God, in His sovereignty, and despite our ignorance and stubbornness, brought the early church to the recognition of the books He had inspired.

“To all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).
Instead, Christ told him he had to become a child of God, saying, “I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again” (John 3:3).
Our response must be to repent (turn from sin) and seek forgiveness in Christ.
Rather than being a child of God, he is a child of disobedience and wrath (Ephesians 2:1–3).
Thankfully, Ephesians 2:4–5 says, “But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.” How are we made alive with Christ / born again / made a child of God?
“To all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).
Born of a virgin through the power of the Holy Spirit, Jesus did not inherit Adam’s sin nature.
God’s plan was to sacrifice His perfect Son on the cross to pay the punishment we deserve for our sin: death.
Thankfully, Ephesians 2:4–5 says, “But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.” How are we made alive with Christ / born again / made a child of God?
 Just as we had no part in our natural birth, we cannot cause ourselves to be born into God’s family by doing good deeds or conjuring up faith of our own.
 When visited by the religious leader Nicodemus, Jesus did not immediately assure him of heaven.
Rather than being a child of God, he is a child of disobedience and wrath (Ephesians 2:1–3).
This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother” (1 John 3:7–10).
He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.
The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work.
No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.
No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.
 What does it mean that we are children of God (1 John 3:2)?
Only those who receive Jesus—not merely knowing about Him but relying on Him for salvation, submitting to Him as Master, and loving Him as the supreme treasure—become children of God.
The child of God, on the other hand, no longer craves the gratification of sin but desires to know, love, and glorify his or her Father.
Thankfully, Ephesians 2:4–5 says, “But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.” How are we made alive with Christ / born again / made a child of God?

The word essentially means “little Christ.” However, over the centuries, believers in Christ have adopted the term “Christian” and use it to identify themselves as followers of Jesus Christ.
 Jesus Christ declared that He “did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45).
The idea of a ransom is most frequently used in instances of kidnapping, when someone is kidnapped and held prisoner until a ransom is paid for the person’s release.

 An important verse in understanding the filling of the Holy Spirit is John 14:16, where Jesus promised the Spirit would indwell believers and that the indwelling would be permanent.
It is important to distinguish the indwelling from the filling of the Spirit.
The permanent indwelling of the Spirit is not for a select few believers, but for all believers.
There are a number of references in Scripture that support this conclusion.
First, the Holy Spirit is a gift given to all believers in Jesus without exception, and no conditions are placed upon this gift except faith in Christ (John 7:37-39).
Second, the Holy Spirit is given at the moment of salvation (Ephesians 1:13).
Galatians 3:2 emphasizes this same truth, saying that the sealing and indwelling of the Spirit took place at the time of believing.
Third, the Holy Spirit indwells believers permanently.
The Holy Spirit is given to believers as a down payment, or verification of their future glorification in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:22; Ephesians 4:30).
This is in contrast to the filling of the Spirit referred to in Ephesians 5:18.
We should be so completely yielded to the Holy Spirit that He can possess us fully and, in that sense, fill us.
Romans 8:9 and Ephesians 1:13-14 states that He dwells within every believer, but He can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30), and His activity within us can be quenched (1 Thessalonians 5:19).
When we allow this to happen, we do not experience the fullness of the Spirit’s working and His power in and through us.
To be filled with the Spirit implies freedom for Him to occupy every part of our lives, guiding and controlling us.
Only our obedience to God’s commands allows the Spirit freedom to work within us.
The filling of the Spirit does not apply to outward acts alone; it also applies to the innermost thoughts and motives of our actions.
Psalm 19:14 says, "May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer."
Ephesians 5:18 commands that we be filled with the Spirit; however, it is not praying for the filling of the Holy Spirit that accomplishes the filling.
Sin is what hinders the filling of the Holy Spirit, and obedience to God is how the filling of the Spirit is maintained.
Ephesians 5:18 commands that we be filled with the Spirit; however, it is not praying for the filling of the Holy Spirit that accomplishes the filling.
Only our obedience to God’s commands allows the Spirit freedom to work within us.
Because we are still infected with sin, it is impossible to be filled with the Spirit all of the time.
When we sin, we should immediately confess it to God and renew our commitment to being Spirit-filled and Spirit-led.

The Philippian jailer asked Paul and Silas, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30).
What we need to be saved from is eternal destruction (Matthew 25:46; Revelation 20:15).
We are born with sin (Psalm 51:5), and we all personally choose to sin (Ecclesiastes 7:20; 1 John 1:8).
What we need to be saved from is eternal destruction (Matthew 25:46; Revelation 20:15).
Because Jesus Christ was human, He could die; and because Jesus Christ was God, His death had an eternal and infinite value.
Paul and Silas responded, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved” (Acts 16:31).
All you must do is receive, in faith, the salvation God offers (Ephesians 2:8-9).

 At some point, every Christian has had a family member, a friend, co-worker, or acquaintance who is not a Christian.
Sharing the gospel with others can be difficult, and it can become even more difficult when it involves someone with whom we have close emotional ties.
The Bible tells us that some people will be offended at the gospel (Luke 12:51–53).
However, we are commanded to share the gospel, and there is no excuse for not doing so (Matthew 28:19–20; Acts 1:8; 1 Peter 3:15).
So, how can we evangelize our family members, friends, co-workers, and acquaintances?
Pray that God would change their hearts and open their eyes to the truth of the gospel (2 Corinthians 4:4).
Pray that God would convince them of His love for them and their need for salvation through Jesus Christ (John 3:16).
Pray for wisdom as to how to best minister to them (James 1:5).
In addition to praying and sharing our faith, we must also live godly Christian lives in front of our friends and family members so they can see the change God has made in us (1 Peter 3:1–2).
There is no substitute for personally sharing the gospel: “Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ” (Romans 10:17).
There is no substitute for personally sharing the gospel: “Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ” (Romans 10:17).
We must be willing and bold in our actual sharing of the gospel.
Proclaim the message of salvation through Jesus Christ to your friends and family (Romans 10:9–10).
Always be prepared to speak of your faith (1 Peter 3:15), doing so with gentleness and respect.
Ultimately, we must leave the salvation of our loved ones up to God.
It is God’s power and grace that saves people, not our efforts.
The best we can do is pray for them, witness to them, and live the Christian life in front of them.

Consider 1 John 5:11–13: “And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
If you have Jesus, you have life.
I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (emphasis added).

By taking God’s Word to heart, you can have no doubt about the reality of your eternal salvation.
Jesus Himself assures those who believe in Him: “I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand” (John 10:28–29).

The problem is that many followers of Jesus Christ look for the assurance of salvation in the wrong places.
                                                                                         Answer
 Do you know for certain that you have eternal life and that you will go to heaven when you die?
God wants you to be sure!
The Bible says: “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (1 John 5:13).
Suppose you were standing before God right now and He asked you, “Why should I let you into heaven?” What would you say?
You may not know what to reply.
What you need to know is that God loves us and has provided a way that we can know for sure where we will spend eternity.
The Bible states it this way: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
We have to first understand the problem that is keeping us from heaven.
The problem is this - our sinful nature keeps us from having a relationship with God.
We are sinners by nature and by choice.
“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).
We cannot save ourselves.
“For by grace are you saved, through faith, and this not of yourselves – it is the gift of God.
Not by works, so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9).
We deserve death and hell.
“For the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).
God is holy and just and must punish sin, yet He loves us and has provided forgiveness for our sin.
Jesus said: “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
Jesus died for us on the cross: “For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous to bring you to God” (1 Peter 3:18).
Jesus was resurrected from the dead: “He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification” (Romans 4:25).
So, back to the original question – “How can I know for sure that I will go to heaven when I die?” The answer is this – believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved (Acts 16:31).
“To all who received Him, to those who believed in His Name, He gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).
You can receive eternal life as a FREE gift.
“The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).
You can live a full and meaningful life right now.
Jesus said: “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
You can spend eternity with Jesus in heaven, for He promised: “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you may also be where I am” (John 14:3).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and receive forgiveness from God, here is prayer you can pray.
Saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Jesus Christ that can provide forgiveness of sins.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your forgiveness.
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.&nbsp;But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.&nbsp;Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness!&nbsp;Amen!"
What is the prayer of salvation?
 What is the right religion for me?
 What does it mean to accept Jesus as your personal Savior?
 What does it mean to be a born again Christian?

                                                                                         Answer
Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—His good, pleasing and perfect will.” This passage gives us an important sequence: the child of God refuses to be conformed to the world and instead allows himself to be transformed by the Spirit.
Romans 12:2 says, “Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—His good, pleasing and perfect will.” This passage gives us an important sequence: the child of God refuses to be conformed to the world and instead allows himself to be transformed by the Spirit.
In the parable of the two sons, Jesus rebukes the chief priests and elders for failing to do the will of the Father; specifically, they “did not repent and believe” (Matthew 21:32).
                                                                                         Answer
At its most basic, the will of God is to repent of our sin and trust in Christ.
                                                                                         Answer
We make many important decisions based on this emotion, and even get married because we feel that we are “in love.” This may be the reason about half of all first marriages end in divorce.
It motivates much of our lives.
We make many important decisions based on this emotion, and even get married because we feel that we are “in love.” This may be the reason about half of all first marriages end in divorce.
We make many important decisions based on this emotion, and even get married because we feel that we are “in love.” This may be the reason about half of all first marriages end in divorce.
The Bible teaches us that true love is not an emotion that can come or go, but a decision.
We are not just to love those who love us; we should even love those who hate us, the same way that Christ loves the unlovable (Luke 6:35).
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres” (1 Corinthians 13:4-7).
It can be very easy to “fall in love” with someone, but there are some questions to ask before deciding if what we are feeling is true love.
First, is this person a Christian, meaning has he given his life to Christ?
The Bible tells us that when two people get married, they become one flesh (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5).
Another thing to consider is whether or not the loved one is a good candidate for being a mate.
There is no measuring stick to determine when we are truly in love with someone, but it is important to discern whether we are following our emotions or following God’s will for our lives.
True love is a decision, not just an emotion.
True biblical love is loving someone all of the time, not just when you feel “in love.”
 Questions about Relationships
   Get Lost: Your Guide to Finding True Love by Dannah Gresh
                                                                                         Answer
 There are two issues involved in this question, the things that the Bible specifically mentions and declares to be sin and those the Bible does not directly address.
Scriptural lists of various sins include Proverbs 6:16-19, Galatians 5:19-21, and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10.
There can be no doubt that these passages present the activities as sinful, things God does not approve of.
Murder, adultery, lying, stealing, etc.—there is no doubt the Bible presents such things as sin.
The more difficult issue is in determining what is sinful in areas that the Bible does not directly address.
When the Bible does not cover a certain subject, we have some general principles in His Word to guide us.
First, when there is no specific scriptural reference, it is good to ask not whether a certain thing is wrong, but, rather, if it is definitely good.
The Bible says, for example, that we are to “make the most of every opportunity” (Colossians 4:5).
Our few days here on earth are so short and precious in relation to eternity that we ought never to waste time on selfish things, but to use it only on “what is helpful for building others up according to their needs” (Ephesians 4:29).
A good test is to determine whether we can honestly, in good conscience, ask God to bless and use the particular activity for His own good purposes.
“So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31).
A good test is to determine whether we can honestly, in good conscience, ask God to bless and use the particular activity for His own good purposes.
“Everything that does not come from faith is sin” (Romans 14:23).
We need to remember that our bodies, as well as our souls, have been redeemed and belong to God.
If there is room for doubt as to whether it pleases God, then it is best to give it up.
Therefore honor God with your body” (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).
This great truth should have a real bearing on what we do and where we go.
In addition, we must evaluate our actions not only in relation to God, but also in relation to their effect on our family, our friends, and other people in general.
Even if a particular thing may not hurt us personally, if it harmfully influences or affects someone else, it is a sin.
“It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall....We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves” (Romans 14:21; 15:1).
Finally, remember that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior, and nothing else can be allowed to take priority over our conformity to His will.
No habit or recreation or ambition can be allowed to have undue control over our lives; only Christ has that authority.
“Everything is permissible for me—but not everything is beneficial.
“Everything is permissible for me—but not everything is beneficial.
Everything is permissible for me—but I will not be mastered by anything” (1 Corinthians 6:12).
“And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him” (Colossians 3:17).
Everything is permissible for me—but I will not be mastered by anything” (1 Corinthians 6:12).

Some people believe they have to obey the Ten Commandments for their entire lives to not go to hell.
Hell is described as “eternal fire” (Matthew 25:41), “unquenchable fire” (Matthew 3:12), “shame and everlasting contempt” (Daniel 12:2), a place where “the fire is not quenched” (Mark 9:44-49), and “everlasting destruction” (2 Thessalonians 1:9).

God promises that anyone who believes in Jesus (John 3:16), trusting Him alone as the Savior (John 14:6), will be saved, i.e., not go to hell.

In this lifetime, we will never be perfectly victorious over sin (1 John 1:8), but that should still be our goal.
All believers already possess the Holy Spirit, but this passage tells us that we need to walk in the Spirit, yielding to His control.
The difference the Holy Spirit can make is demonstrated in the life of Peter, who, before being filled with the Holy Spirit, denied Jesus three times—and this after he had said he would follow Christ to the death.
God has given us wonderful promises concerning prayer (Matthew 7:7-11; Luke 18:1-8; John 6:23-27; 1 John 5:14-15), and Paul includes prayer in his passage on preparing for spiritual battle (Ephesians 6:18).
Hebrews 4:12 tells us that the Word of God is living and powerful, able to penetrate to our hearts to root out and overcome the deepest sins of heart and attitude.
We either take in just enough to keep us alive spiritually by eating from the Word (but never ingesting enough to be healthy, thriving Christians), or we come to feed often but never meditate on it long enough to get spiritual nutrition from it.
The Bible is the tool the Spirit uses in our lives (Ephesians 6:17), an essential and major part of the armor that God gives us to fight our spiritual battles (Ephesians 6:12-18).
God has given us wonderful promises concerning prayer (Matthew 7:7-11; Luke 18:1-8; John 6:23-27; 1 John 5:14-15), and Paul includes prayer in his passage on preparing for spiritual battle (Ephesians 6:18).
The difference the Holy Spirit can make is demonstrated in the life of Peter, who, before being filled with the Holy Spirit, denied Jesus three times—and this after he had said he would follow Christ to the death.
Prayer is simply acknowledging our own limitations and God’s inexhaustible power and turning to Him for that strength to do what He wants us to do, not what we want to do (1 John 5:14-15).
God has given us wonderful promises concerning prayer (Matthew 7:7-11; Luke 18:1-8; John 6:23-27; 1 John 5:14-15), and Paul includes prayer in his passage on preparing for spiritual battle (Ephesians 6:18).
There is strength in numbers (Ecclesiastes 4:11-12).
Having an accountability partner or an accountability group can give us the final dose of encouragement and motivation we need to overcome even the most stubborn of sins.
We give token service to it by carrying our Bibles to church or reading a daily devotional or a chapter a day, but we fail to memorize it, meditate on it, or apply it to our lives; we fail to confess the sins it reveals or praise God for the gifts it reveals to us.

This means choosing to consistently follow the Holy Spirit’s prompting in our lives rather than following the flesh.

In Matthew 16:15-16, Jesus asks, “Who do you say I am?” Peter answers, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” and for this answer Peter is called “blessed.” In 2 John 9, we read, “Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.” In other words, Jesus Christ and His work of redemption is of utmost importance; beware of anyone who denies that Jesus is equal with God, who downplays Jesus’ sacrificial death, or who rejects Jesus’ humanity.

Speaking of false teachers, Jude 11 says, “They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam’s error; they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion.” In other words, a false teacher can be known by his pride (Cain’s rejection of God’s plan), greed (Balaam’s prophesying for money), and rebellion (Korah’s promotion of himself over Moses).

 This question has been asked by countless people throughout the ages.
Samuel heard the voice of God, but did not recognize it until he was instructed by Eli (1 Samuel 3:1–10).
Gideon had a physical revelation from God, and he still doubted what he had heard to the point of asking for a sign, not once, but three times (Judges 6:17–22,36–40).
When we are listening for God’s voice, how can we know that He is the one speaking?
We have the complete Bible, the inspired Word of God, to read, study, and meditate on.
“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16–17).
Samuel heard the voice of God, but did not recognize it until he was instructed by Eli (1 Samuel 3:1–10).
When we have a question about a certain topic or decision in our lives, we should see what the Bible has to say about it.
Samuel heard the voice of God, but did not recognize it until he was instructed by Eli (1 Samuel 3:1–10).
If we are to recognize God’s voice, we must belong to Him.
Jesus said, “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27).
We hear His voice when we spend time in Bible study and quiet contemplation of His Word.
These are the sheep who hear and recognize His voice, because they know Him as their Shepherd.
If we are to recognize God’s voice, we must belong to Him.
We hear His voice when we spend time in Bible study and quiet contemplation of His Word.
The more time we spend intimately with God and His Word, the easier it is to recognize His voice and His leading in our lives.
Employees at a bank are trained to recognize counterfeits by studying genuine money so closely that it is easy to spot a fake.
We should be so familiar with God’s Word that when someone speaks error to us, it is clear that it is not of God.
While God could speak audibly to people today, He speaks primarily through His written Word.
Sometimes God’s leading can come through the Holy Spirit, through our consciences, through circumstances, and through the exhortations of other people.
By comparing what we hear to the truth of Scripture, we can learn to recognize God’s voice.
 Questions about the Christian Life
Employees at a bank are trained to recognize counterfeits by studying genuine money so closely that it is easy to spot a fake.
                                                                                         Answer
 Romans 12:3-8 and 1 Corinthians chapter 12 make it clear that each Christian is given spiritual gifts according to the Lord’s choice.
Spiritual gifts are given for the edification of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:7, 14:12).
Both 1 Timothy 4:14 and 2 Timothy 1:6 refer to a gift that Timothy had received at the time of his ordination “by prophecy.” This likely indicates that one of the elders at Timothy’s ordination spoke about a spiritual gift that Timothy would have to enable his future ministry.
Most assume that spiritual gifts are given at the time of spiritual birth (the moment of salvation).
However, there are some verses that may indicate God gives spiritual gifts later as well.
Both 1 Timothy 4:14 and 2 Timothy 1:6 refer to a gift that Timothy had received at the time of his ordination “by prophecy.” This likely indicates that one of the elders at Timothy’s ordination spoke about a spiritual gift that Timothy would have to enable his future ministry.
Both 1 Timothy 4:14 and 2 Timothy 1:6 refer to a gift that Timothy had received at the time of his ordination “by prophecy.” This likely indicates that one of the elders at Timothy’s ordination spoke about a spiritual gift that Timothy would have to enable his future ministry.
We are also told in 1 Corinthians 12:28-31 and in 1 Corinthians 14:12-13 that it is God (not us) who chooses the gifts.
These passages also indicate that not everyone will have a particular gift.
Paul tells the Corinthian believers that if they are going to covet or long after spiritual gifts, they should strive after the more edifying gifts, such as prophesying (speaking forth the word of God for the building up of others).
Now, why would Paul tell them to strongly desire the “greater” gifts if they already had been given all they would be given, and there was no further opportunity of gaining these greater gifts?
Having said this, it still remains that these gifts are distributed according to God’s choosing, not our own.
If every Corinthian strongly desired a particular gift, such as prophesying, God would not give everyone that gift simply because they strongly desired it.
If He did, then who would serve in all of the other functions of the body of Christ?
It may lead one to believe that even as Solomon sought wisdom from God in order to be a good ruler over God’s people, so God will grant to us those gifts we need in order to be of greater benefit to His church.
If God commands us to do something (such as witness, love the unlovely, disciple the nations, etc.
Some may not be as gifted at evangelism as others, but God commands all Christians to witness and disciple (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8).
We are all called to evangelize whether or not we have the spiritual gift of evangelism.
A determined Christian who strives to learn the Word and develop his teaching ability may become a better teacher than one who may have the spiritual gift of teaching, but who neglects the gift.
Are spiritual gifts given to us when we receive Christ, or are they cultivated through our walk with God?
Normally, spiritual gifts are given at salvation, but also need to be cultivated through spiritual growth.
First Corinthians 12:31 seems to indicate that this is possible: “earnestly desire the best gifts.” You can seek a spiritual gift from God and be zealous after it by seeking to develop that area.

First Corinthians 12:31 seems to indicate that this is possible: “earnestly desire the best gifts.” You can seek a spiritual gift from God and be zealous after it by seeking to develop that area.
At the same time, if it is not God’s will, you will not receive a certain spiritual gift no matter how strongly you seek after it.
God is infinitely wise, and He knows through which gifts you will be most productive for His kingdom.
No matter how much we have been gifted with one gift or another, we are all called upon to develop a number of areas mentioned in the lists of spiritual gifts: to be hospitable, to show acts of mercy, to serve one another, to evangelize, etc.
As we seek to serve God out of love for the purpose of building up others for His glory, He will bring glory to His name, grow His church, and reward us (1 Corinthians 3:5-8, 12:31–14:1).
God promises that as we make Him our delight, He will give us the desires of our heart (Psalm 37:4-5).
This would surely include preparing us to serve Him in a way that will bring us purpose and satisfaction.

The Spirit-Filled Life: Discovering the Joy of Surrendering to the Holy Spirit by Charles Stanley
                                                                                         Answer
 It is impossible for us to fully understand the relationship between God’s sovereignty and man’s free will and responsibility.
Only God truly knows how they work together in His plan of salvation.
With this doctrine, probably more so than with any other, it is crucially important to admit our inability to fully grasp the nature of God and our relationship with Him.
Going too far to either side results in a distorted understanding of salvation.
Scripture is clear that God determines who will be saved (Romans 8:29; 1 Peter 1:2).
Ephesians 1:4 tells us that God chose us “before the creation of the world.” The Bible repeatedly describes believers as the “chosen” (Romans 8:33, 11:5; Ephesians 1:11; Colossians 3:12; 1 Thessalonians 1:4; 1 Peter 1:2, 2:9) and the “elect” (Matthew 24:22, 31; Mark 13:20, 27; Romans 11:7; 1 Timothy 5:21; 2 Timothy 2:10; Titus 1:1; 1 Peter 1:1).
The fact that believers are predestined (Romans 8:29-30; Ephesians 1:5, 11) and elected for salvation (Romans 9:11, 11:28; 2 Peter 1:10) is clear.
The fact that believers are predestined (Romans 8:29-30; Ephesians 1:5, 11) and elected for salvation (Romans 9:11, 11:28; 2 Peter 1:10) is clear.
If we believe in Jesus Christ we will be saved (John 3:16; Romans 10:9-10).
God knows who will be saved and God chooses who will be saved, and we must choose Christ in order to be saved.
How these facts work together is impossible for a finite mind to comprehend (Romans 11:33-36).
Our responsibility is to take the gospel to the world (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8).
We should leave foreknowledge, election, and predestination up to God and simply be obedient in sharing the gospel.

                                                                                         Answer
And that’s when the man asked, “What must I do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30).
The very fact that the man asks the question shows that he recognized his need of salvation—he saw only death for himself, and he knew he needed help.
That answer comes swiftly and simply: “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved” (verse 31).
His faith also included a belief that Jesus died for sin and rose again, because that was the message that Paul and Silas were preaching (see Romans 10:9-10 and 1 Corinthians 15:1-4).
Both repentance and faith are indicated in 1 Thessalonians 1:9—“You turned to God from idols.” A Christian will leave behind his former ways and anything pertaining to false religion as the result of a genuine conversion to Christianity.

Converting to Christianity is receiving the gift that God offers and beginning a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that results in the forgiveness of sins and eternity in Heaven after death.

                                                                                         Answer
 In order to get “right” with God, we must first understand what is “wrong.” The answer is sin.
“There is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 14:3).
We have rebelled against God’s commands; we “like sheep, have gone astray” (Isaiah 53:6).
The bad news is that the penalty for sin is death.
“The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4).
The good news is that a loving God has pursued us in order to bring us salvation.
Jesus declared His purpose was “to seek and to save what was lost” (Luke 19:10), and He pronounced His purpose accomplished when He died on the cross with the words, “It is finished!” (John 19:30).
Having a right relationship with God begins with acknowledging your sin.
Next comes a humble confession of your sin to God (Isaiah 57:15).
“For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved” (Romans 10:10).
This repentance must be accompanied by faith – specifically, faith that Jesus’ sacrificial death and miraculous resurrection qualify Him to be your Savior.
“If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9).
Many other passages speak of the necessity of faith, such as John 20:27; Acts 16:31; Galatians 2:16; 3:11, 26; and Ephesians 2:8.
Being right with God is a matter of your response to what God has done on your behalf.
He sent the Savior, He provided the sacrifice to take away your sin (John 1:29), and He offers you the promise: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Acts 2:21).
A beautiful illustration of repentance and forgiveness is the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32).
The younger son wasted his father’s gift in shameful sin (verse 13).
When he acknowledged his wrongdoing, he decided to return home (verse 18).
He assumed he would no longer be considered a son (verse 19), but he was wrong.
The father loved the returned rebel as much as ever (verse 20).
All was forgiven, and a celebration ensued (verse 24).
God is good to keep His promises, including the promise to forgive.
“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18).
If you want to get right with God, here is a sample prayer.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness – the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"

                                                                                         Answer
 There is no magic formula or definitive test that can tell us exactly what our spiritual gifts are.
The Holy Spirit distributes the gifts as He determines (1 Corinthians 12:7-11).
A common problem for Christians is the temptation to get so caught up in our spiritual gift that we only seek to serve God in the area in which we feel we have been gifted.
Spiritual gift tests or inventories, while not to be fully relied upon, can definitely help us understand where our gifting might be.
God calls us to obediently serve Him in all things.
He will equip us with whatever gift or gifts we need to accomplish the task He has called us to.
Identifying our spiritual giftedness can be accomplished in various ways.
Spiritual gift tests or inventories, while not to be fully relied upon, can definitely help us understand where our gifting might be.
Confirmation from others also gives light to our spiritual giftedness.
Other people who see us serving the Lord can often identify a spiritual gift in us that we might take for granted or not recognize.
Prayer is also important.
The one person who knows exactly how we are spiritually gifted is the gift-giver Himself—the Holy Spirit.
We can ask God to show us how we are gifted in order to better use our spiritual gifts for His glory.
God calls some to be servants and blesses them with the gift of helps.
Yes, God calls some to be teachers and gives them the gift of teaching.
However, specifically knowing our spiritual gift does not excuse us from serving God in areas outside our gifting.
Is it beneficial to know what spiritual gift(s) God has given us?
Is it wrong to focus so much on spiritual gifts that we miss other opportunities to serve God?
If we are dedicated to being used by God, He will equip us with the spiritual gifts we need.

The Spirit-Filled Life: Discovering the Joy of Surrendering to the Holy Spirit by Charles Stanley
                                                                                         Answer
While the Bible undeniably advocates physical discipline, the Bible is more concerned with the goal of building godly character than it is in the precise method used to produce that goal.
According to the Bible, though, the appropriate and restrained physical discipline of children is a good thing and contributes to the well-being and correct upbringing of the child.
The book of Proverbs contains plentiful wisdom regarding the rearing of children, such as, “The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself disgraces his mother” (Proverbs 29:15).
They won’t die if you spank them.
God Himself uses discipline to correct us and lead us down the right path and to encourage repentance for our wrong actions (Psalm 94:12; Proverbs 1:7; 6:23; 12:1; 13:1; 15:5; Isaiah 38:16; Hebrews 12:9).

 Since the fall of man, the basis of salvation has always been the death of Christ.
No one, either prior to the cross or since the cross, would ever be saved without that one pivotal event in the history of the world.
Christ’s death paid the penalty for past sins of Old Testament saints and future sins of New Testament saints.
Genesis 15:6 tells us that Abraham believed God and that was enough for God to credit it to him for righteousness (see also Romans 4:3-8).
The object of one’s faith for salvation has always been God.
The psalmist wrote, “Blessed are all who take refuge in him” (Psalm 2:12).
Genesis 15:6 tells us that Abraham believed God and that was enough for God to credit it to him for righteousness (see also Romans 4:3-8).
The Old Testament sacrificial system did not take away sin, as Hebrews 10:1-10 clearly teaches.
It did, however, point to the day when the Son of God would shed His blood for the sinful human race.
What has changed through the ages is the content of a believer’s faith.
 Since the fall of man, the basis of salvation has always been the death of Christ.

Adam believed the promise God gave in Genesis 3:15 that the Seed of the woman would conquer Satan.
Adam believed Him, demonstrated by the name he gave Eve (v. 20) and the Lord indicated His acceptance immediately by covering them with coats of skin (v. 21).
At that point that is all Adam knew, but he believed it.
Abraham believed God according to the promises and new revelation God gave him in Genesis 12 and 15.
Adam believed the promise God gave in Genesis 3:15 that the Seed of the woman would conquer Satan.
Throughout the Old Testament, believers came to salvation because they believed that God would someday take care of their sin problem.
Today, we look back, believing that He has already taken care of our sins on the cross (John 3:16; Hebrews 9:28).
Late in His ministry, “Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life” (Matthew 16:21-22).
What was the reaction of His disciples to this message?
‘Never, Lord!’ he said.
‘This shall never happen to you!’” Peter and the other disciples did not know the full truth, yet they were saved because they believed that God would take care of their sin problem.
They didn’t exactly know how He would accomplish that, any more than Adam, Abraham, Moses, or David knew how, but they believed God.
Today, we have more revelation than the people living before the resurrection of Christ; we know the full picture.
“In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe” (Hebrews 1:1-2).
Our salvation is still based on the death of Christ, our faith is still the requirement for salvation, and the object of our faith is still God.
Today, for us, the content of our faith is that Jesus Christ died for our sins, He was buried, and He rose the third day (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).

Making Sense of Salvation by Wayne Grudem
                                                                                         Answer
 We often receive questions like “I am divorced for such and such a reason.
Can I get remarried?” “I have been divorced twice—the first for adultery by my spouse, the second for incompatibility.
I am dating a man who has been divorced three times—the first for incompatibility, the second for adultery on his part, the third for adultery on his wife’s part.
Can we get married to each other?” Questions like these are very difficult to answer because the Bible does not go into great detail regarding the various scenarios for remarriage after a divorce.
What we can know for sure is that it is God’s plan for a married couple to stay married as long as both spouses are alive (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:6).
The only specific allowance for remarriage after a divorce is for adultery (Matthew 19:9), and even this is debated among Christians.
Another possibility is desertion—when an unbelieving spouse leaves a believing spouse (1 Corinthians 7:12–15).
This passage, though, does not specifically address remarriage, only being bound to stay in a marriage.
Instances of physical, sexual, or severe emotional abuse would be sufficient cause for separation, but the Bible does not speak of these sins in the context of divorce or remarriage.
This passage, though, does not specifically address remarriage, only being bound to stay in a marriage.
We know two things for sure.
Being single should not be viewed as a curse or punishment, but as an opportunity to serve God wholeheartedly (1 Corinthians 7:32-36).
Every divorce is a result of sin, either on the part of one spouse or both.
Does God forgive divorce?
Forgiveness of all sins is available through faith in Jesus Christ (Matthew 26:28; Ephesians 1:7).
Does God forgive divorce?
God sometimes calls people to remain single (1 Corinthians 7:7-8).
Being single should not be viewed as a curse or punishment, but as an opportunity to serve God wholeheartedly (1 Corinthians 7:32-36).
God’s Word does tell us, though, that it is better to marry than to burn with passion (1 Corinthians 7:9).
Perhaps this sometimes applies to remarriage after a divorce.
So, can you or should you get remarried?
Ultimately, that is between you, your potential spouse, and, most importantly, God.
Being single should not be viewed as a curse or punishment, but as an opportunity to serve God wholeheartedly (1 Corinthians 7:32-36).
Pray with an open mind and genuinely ask the Lord to place His desires on your heart (Psalm 37:4).
Seek the Lord’s will (Proverbs 3:5-6) and follow His leading.
 Questions about Marriage
God’s Word does tell us, though, that it is better to marry than to burn with passion (1 Corinthians 7:9).
                                                                                         Answer
Please read John 5:19-27, particularly verse 23 where Jesus teaches that the Father sent the Son (also see John 15:10).
The tri-unity always existed, the Father God, the Son God, and the Spirit God, not three gods, but one God existing as three persons.
As the God-man, He had to learn obedience (Hebrews 5:8) to His Father as He was tempted by Satan, accused falsely by men, rejected by His people, and eventually crucified.
This relationship is depicted in the Gospels so we can see how the Son of God in His humanity carried out His Father’s will, and in doing so, purchased redemption for His children (John 6:38).
Jesus’ praying to the Father was a demonstration of His relationship within the Trinity and an example for us that we must rely on God through prayer for the strength and wisdom we need.
                                                                                         Answer
His praying showed His dependence upon His Father in His humanity to carry out His Father’s plan of redemption, as evidenced in Christ’s high priestly prayer in John 17.
                                                                                         Answer
God imputed Christ’s righteousness to those who humbly ask for forgiveness of sin (Isaiah 53:5-6; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
There is also daily forgiveness as we confess our sins and forsake them for our sanctification.

Yes, God can and will forgive any sin.
The doctrine of atonement is what explains salvation and forgiveness of sin.
There is also daily forgiveness as we confess our sins and forsake them for our sanctification.
Salvation begins by humbly acknowledging that we will never be good enough to get into heaven on our own merit and that we need forgiveness of sin.

God imputed Christ’s righteousness to those who humbly ask for forgiveness of sin (Isaiah 53:5-6; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
So, if you have received Jesus Christ as your Savior, God has already forgiven all your sins.

There is also daily forgiveness as we confess our sins and forsake them for our sanctification.
There is also daily forgiveness as we confess our sins and forsake them for our sanctification.
Understanding that Jesus is fully capable of forgiving any measure of sin is the hope of our salvation.
When we contemplate our own sin and how wretched and unworthy of forgiveness we are, it becomes clear that God is loving, compassionate, and worthy of our worship.
But for those who ask for forgiveness of sin, they can believe that Jesus is sufficient and eager to forgive and save them from their sin, and they will ultimately enter into His courts with praise (Psalm 100:4).
Accepting Jesus Christ means believing that His death and resurrection paid the penalty for all sin ever committed and that it is sufficient to cover all sin (1 John 2:2).
But for those who ask for forgiveness of sin, they can believe that Jesus is sufficient and eager to forgive and save them from their sin, and they will ultimately enter into His courts with praise (Psalm 100:4).
 Questions about the Christian Life
Feeling guilty over sin is actually a natural response of our conscience, and it is there to remind us not to repeat sinful patterns.
                                                                                         Answer
 While certain ministries of the Holy Spirit may involve a feeling, such as conviction of sin, comfort, and empowerment, Scripture does not instruct us to base our relationship with the Holy Spirit on how or what we feel.
Every born-again believer has the indwelling Holy Spirit.
Jesus told us that when the Comforter has come He will be with us and in us.
But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you” (John 14:16-17).
In other words, Jesus is sending one like Himself to be with us and in us.
We know the Holy Spirit is with us because God’s Word tells us that it is so.
Every born-again believer is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, but not every believer is controlled by the Holy Spirit, and there is a distinct difference.
When we step out in our flesh, we are not under the control of the Holy Spirit even though we are still indwelt by Him.
The apostle Paul comments on this truth, and he uses an illustration that helps us to understand.
Instead, be filled with the Spirit” (Ephesians 5:18).
Many people read this verse and interpret it to mean that the apostle Paul is speaking against wine.
However, the context of this passage is the walk and the warfare of the Spirit-filled believer.
Therefore, there is something more here than just a warning about drinking too much wine.
When people are drunk with too much wine, they exhibit certain characteristics: they become clumsy, their speech is slurred, and their judgment is impaired.
The apostle Paul sets up a comparison here.
Just as there are certain characteristics that identify someone who is controlled by too much wine, there should also be certain characteristics that identify someone who is controlled by the Holy Spirit.
The verb tense in Ephesians 5:18 indicates a continual process of “being filled” by the Holy Spirit.
This is the Holy Spirit’s fruit, and it is exhibited by the born-again believer who is under His control.
The verb tense in Ephesians 5:18 indicates a continual process of “being filled” by the Holy Spirit.
Since it is an exhortation, it follows that it is also possible to not be filled or controlled by the Spirit.
The rest of Ephesians 5 gives us the characteristics of a Spirit-filled believer.
Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ” (Ephesians 5:19-21).
We are not filled with the Spirit because we feel we are, but because this is the privilege and possession of the Christian.
Being filled or controlled by the Spirit is the result of walking in obedience to the Lord.
This is a gift of grace and not an emotional feeling.
Emotions can and will deceive us, and we can work ourselves up into an emotional frenzy that is purely from the flesh and not of the Holy Spirit.
“So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature … Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:16, 25).
Having said that, we cannot deny that there are times when we can be overwhelmed by the presence and the power of the Spirit, and this is often an emotional experience.
Having said that, we cannot deny that there are times when we can be overwhelmed by the presence and the power of the Spirit, and this is often an emotional experience.
King David “danced with all his might” (2 Samuel 6:14) when they brought up the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.
Experiencing joy by the Spirit is the understanding that as children of God we are being blessed by His grace.
At the same time, we are not to base the assurance of our possession of the Holy Spirit on how we feel.

The Spirit-Filled Life: Discovering the Joy of Surrendering to the Holy Spirit by Charles Stanley
                                                                                         Answer
There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” If some of our loved ones are not in heaven, we will be in 100 percent complete agreement that they do not belong there and that they are condemned by their own refusal to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior (John 3:16; 14:6).
It seems that the unsaved are resurrected with a body prepared for eternity just as the saved are (Revelation 20:13; Acts 24:15).
Annihilationists are correct that the Greek word aionion, which is usually translated “eternal,” does not by definition mean “eternal.” It specifically refers to an “age” or “eon,” a specific period of time.
Revelation 20:10 speaks of Satan, the beast, and the false prophet being cast into the lake of fire and being tormented “day and night forever and ever.” It is clear that these three are not “extinguished” by being cast into the lake of fire.

Jesus’ death was an infinite death, paying our infinite sin debt so that we would not have to pay it in hell for eternity (2 Corinthians 5:21).

For many, annihilationism is an attractive belief because of the awfulness of the idea of people spending eternity in hell.
                                                                                         Answer
 Corporate prayer is an important part of the life of the church, along with worship, sound doctrine, communion, and fellowship.
The early church met regularly to learn the doctrine of the apostles, break bread, and pray together (Acts 2:42).
When we pray together with other believers, the effects can be very positive.
Corporate prayer edifies and unifies us as we share our common faith.
The same Holy Spirit who dwells within each believer causes our hearts to rejoice as we hear praises to our Lord and Savior, knitting us together in a unique bond of fellowship found nowhere else in life.
To those who may be alone and struggling with life’s burdens, hearing others lift them up to the throne of grace can be a great encouragement.
It also builds in us love and concern for others as we intercede for them.
At the same time, corporate prayer will only be a reflection of the hearts of the individuals who participate.
We are to come to God in humility (James 4:10), truth (Psalm 145:18), obedience (1 John 3:21-22), with thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6) and confidence (Hebrews 4:16).
Sadly, corporate prayer can also become a platform for those whose words are directed not to God, but to their hearers.
Jesus warned against such behavior in Matthew 6:5-8 where He exhorts us not to be showy, long-winded, or hypocritical in our prayers, but to pray secretly in our own rooms in order to avoid the temptation of using prayer hypocritically.
There is nothing in Scripture to suggest that corporate prayers are “more powerful” than individual prayers in the sense of moving the hand of God.
Far too many Christians equate prayer with “getting things from God,” and group prayer becomes mainly an occasion to recite a list of our wants.
Biblical prayers, however, are multi-faceted, encompassing the whole of the desire to enter into conscious and intimate communion with our holy, perfect, and righteous God.
That such a God would bend an ear to His creatures causes praise and adoration to pour forth in abundance (Psalm 27:4; 63:1-8), produces heartfelt repentance and confession (Psalm 51; Luke 18:9-14), generates an outpouring of gratitude and thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6; Colossians 1:12), and creates sincere intercessory pleas on behalf of others (2 Thessalonians 1:11; 2:16).
Prayer, then, is cooperating with God to bring about His plan, not trying to bend Him to our will.
As we abandon our own desires in submission to the One who knows our circumstances far better than we ever could and who “knows what you need before you ask” (Matthew 6:8), our prayers reach their highest level.
Prayers offered in submission to the Divine will, therefore, are always answered positively, whether offered by one person or a thousand.
The idea that corporate prayers are more likely to move the hand of God comes largely from a misinterpretation of Matthew 18:19-20, “Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.” These verses come from a larger passage which addresses the procedures to be followed in the case of church discipline of a sinning member.
For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.” These verses come from a larger passage which addresses the procedures to be followed in the case of church discipline of a sinning member.
To interpret them as promising believers a blank check for anything they might agree to ask God for, no matter how sinful or foolish, not only does not fit the context of church discipline, but it denies the rest of Scripture, especially the sovereignty of God.
In addition, to believe that when “two or three are gathered” to pray, some kind of magical power boost is automatically applied to our prayers is not biblically supportable.
Of course Jesus is present when two or three pray, but He is equally present when one believer prays alone, even if that person is separated from others by thousands of miles.
Corporate prayer is important because it creates unity (John 17:22-23) and is a key aspect of believers’ encouraging one another (1 Thessalonians 5:11) and spurring one another on to love and good deeds (Hebrews 10:24).

The Prayer That Turns the World Upside Down: The Lord’s Prayer as a Manifesto for Revolution by R. Albert Mohler Jr.
                                                                                         Answer
 The most frequent objection to the doctrine of eternal security is that it supposedly allows people to live any way that they want and still be saved.
While this may be “technically” true, it is not true in reality.
A person who has truly been redeemed by Jesus Christ will not live a life characterized by continuous, willful sin.
We must draw a distinction between how a Christian should live and what a person must do in order to receive salvation.
The Bible is clear that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone (John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8-9; John 14:6).
The moment a person truly believes in Jesus Christ, he or she is saved and secure in that salvation.
It is unbiblical to say that salvation is received by faith, but then has to be maintained by works.
The apostle Paul addresses this issue in Galatians 3:3 when he asks, “Are you so foolish?
We cannot earn our own salvation.
We cannot earn our own salvation.
It is God who maintains our salvation (Jude 24).
It is God’s hand that holds us firmly in His grasp (John 10:28-29).
It is God’s love that nothing can separate us from (Romans 8:38-39).
Any denial of eternal security is, in its essence, a belief that we must maintain our own salvation by our own good works and efforts.
This is completely antithetical to salvation by grace.
We are saved because of Christ’s merits, not our own (Romans 4:3-8).
To claim that we must obey God’s Word or live a godly life to maintain our salvation is saying that Jesus’ death was not sufficient to pay the penalty for our sins.
Jesus’ death was absolutely sufficient to pay for all of our sins—past, present, and future, pre-salvation and post-salvation (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
This is essentially a hypothetical question, because the Bible makes it clear that a true Christian will not live “any way he wants to.” Christians are new creations (2 Corinthians 5:17).
Christians demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23), not the acts of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21).
Christians demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23), not the acts of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21).
First John 3:6-9 clearly states that a true Christian will not live in continual sin.
In response to the accusation that grace promotes sin, the apostle Paul declared, “What shall we say, then?
We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?” (Romans 6:1-2).
Jesus’ death was absolutely sufficient to pay for all of our sins—past, present, and future, pre-salvation and post-salvation (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Rather, it is the security of knowing that God’s love is guaranteed for those who trust in Christ.
Knowing and understanding God’s tremendous gift of salvation accomplishes the opposite of giving a license to sin.
How could anyone, knowing the price Jesus Christ paid for us, go on to live a life of sin (Romans 6:15-23)?
No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him” (1 John 3:6).
 Questions about Salvation
Such a person is demonstrating not that eternal security has given him a license to sin, but rather that he or she has not truly experienced salvation through Jesus Christ.

Scripture also encourages us to stay away from attempts to “get rich quick” (Proverbs 13:11; 23:5; Ecclesiastes 5:10).
Gambling is no more or less of a waste of money than seeing a movie (in many cases), eating an unnecessarily expensive meal, or purchasing a worthless item.
While the Bible does not explicitly mention gambling, it does mention events of “luck” or “chance.” As an example, casting lots is used in Leviticus to choose between the sacrificial goat and the scapegoat.
Proverbs 16:33 says, “The lot is cast in the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.”
Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” Hebrews 13:5 declares, “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’” Matthew 6:24 proclaims, “No one can serve two masters.
Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” Hebrews 13:5 declares, “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’” Matthew 6:24 proclaims, “No one can serve two masters.
Neither does God need or want money that was “stolen” from the poor in the temptation for riches.
First Timothy 6:10 tells us, “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.
Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” Hebrews 13:5 declares, “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’” Matthew 6:24 proclaims, “No one can serve two masters.

 We know that God is real because He has revealed Himself to us in three ways: in creation, in His Word, and in His Son, Jesus Christ.
The most basic proof of God’s existence is simply what He has made.
“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse” (Romans 1:20).
“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.” (Psalm 19:1).
If I found a wristwatch in the middle of a field, I would not assume that it just “appeared” out of nowhere or that it had always existed.
Based on the watch’s design, I would assume it had a designer.
But there is far greater design and precision in the world around us.
Our measurement of time is not based on wristwatches, but on God’s handiwork—the regular rotation of the earth (and the radioactive properties of the cesium-133 atom).
The universe displays great design, and this argues for a Great Designer.
If I found an encoded message, I would seek out a cryptographer to help break the code.
My assumption would be that there is an intelligent sender of the message, someone who created the code.
How complex is the DNA “code” that we carry in every cell of our bodies?
Does not the complexity and purpose of DNA argue for an Intelligent Writer of the code?
Not only has God made an intricate and finely tuned physical world; He has also instilled a sense of eternity in the heart of every person (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
Mankind has an innate perception that there is more to life than meets the eye, that there is an existence higher than this earthly routine.
Our sense of eternity manifests itself in at least two ways: law-making and worship.
Every civilization throughout history has valued certain moral laws, which are surprisingly similar from culture to culture.
For example, the ideal of love is universally esteemed, while the act of lying is universally condemned.
This common morality—this global understanding of right and wrong—points to a Supreme Moral Being who gave us such scruples.
In the same way, people all over the world, regardless of culture, have always cultivated a system of worship.
The object of worship may vary, but the sense of a “higher power” is an undeniable part of being human.
Our propensity to worship accords with the fact that God created us “in His own image” (Genesis 1:27).
God has also revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible.
Throughout Scripture, the existence of God is treated as a self-evident fact (Genesis 1:1; Exodus 3:14).
When Benjamin Franklin wrote his autobiography, he did not waste time trying to prove his own existence.
Likewise, God does not spend much time proving His existence in His book.
The life-changing nature of the Bible, its integrity, and the miracles which accompanied its writing should be enough to warrant a closer look.
The third way in which God revealed Himself is through His Son, Jesus Christ (John 14:6-11).
“In the beginning was the Word: the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:1,14; see also Colossians 2:9).
In Jesus’ amazing life, He kept the entire Old Testament law perfectly and fulfilled the prophecies concerning the Messiah (Matthew 5:17).
He performed countless acts of compassion and public miracles to authenticate His message and bear witness to His deity (John 21:24-25).
Then, three days after His crucifixion, He rose from the dead, a fact affirmed by hundreds of eyewitnesses (1 Corinthians 15:6).
The historical record abounds with “proof” of who Jesus is.
As the Apostle Paul said, this thing “was not done in a corner” (Acts 26:26).
We realize that there will always be skeptics who have their own ideas concerning God and will read the evidence accordingly.
And there will be some whom no amount of proof will convince (Psalm 14:1).
It all comes down to faith (Hebrews 11:6).

The Bible describes men treating women as little more than property, but that does not mean God approves of that action.
By modern value systems and worldly human viewpoint, that is called “sexist.” God ordained the order in society, not man, and He is the author of the establishment principles of authority.
The New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old, and in it we find principles that tell us the correct line of authority and the cure for sin, the ill of all humanity, and that includes discrimination based upon gender.
John 3:16 says, “Whoever believes,” and that is an all-inclusive statement that leaves no one out on the basis of position in society, mental capacity, or gender.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28).

 It is interesting that a much higher percentage of people believe in the existence of heaven than believe in the existence of hell.
According to the Bible, though, hell is just as real as heaven.
The Bible clearly and explicitly teaches that hell is a real place to which the wicked/unbelieving are sent after death.
We have all sinned against God (Romans 3:23).
The just punishment for that sin is death (Romans 6:23).
Since all of our sin is ultimately against God (Psalm 51:4), and since God is an infinite and eternal Being, the punishment for sin, death, must also be infinite and eternal.
Hell is this infinite and eternal death which we have earned because of our sin.
The punishment of the wicked dead in hell is described throughout Scripture as “eternal fire” (Matthew 25:41), “unquenchable fire” (Matthew 3:12), “shame and everlasting contempt” (Daniel 12:2), a place where “the fire is not quenched” (Mark 9:44-49), a place of “torment” and “fire” (Luke 16:23-24), “everlasting destruction” (2 Thessalonians 1:9), a place where “the smoke of torment rises forever and ever” (Revelation 14:10-11), and a “lake of burning sulfur” where the wicked are “tormented day and night forever and ever” (Revelation 20:10).
Jesus Himself indicates that punishment in hell is just as everlasting as life in heaven (Matthew 25:46).
Jesus Himself indicates that punishment in hell is just as everlasting as life in heaven (Matthew 25:46).
The wicked are forever subject to the fury and the wrath of God.
Those in hell will acknowledge the perfect justice of God (Psalm 76:10).
Those who are in hell will know that their punishment is just and that they alone are to blame (Deuteronomy 32:3-5).
Yes, hell is real.
Yes, hell is a place of torment and punishment that lasts forever and ever, with no end.
Praise God that, through Jesus, we can escape this eternal fate (John 3:16, 18, 36).

Four Views on Hell edited by Crockett &amp; Gundry
                                                                                         Answer
 In Luke 18:1-7, Jesus uses a parable to illustrate the importance of persevering in prayer.
He tells the story of a widow who came to an unjust judge seeking justice against her adversary.
He tells the story of a widow who came to an unjust judge seeking justice against her adversary.
Jesus’ point is that if an unjust judge will grant the petition of someone who perseveres in a request for justice, how much more will the God who loves us—“his chosen ones” (v. 7)—answer our prayer when we keep praying?
Rather, God promises to avenge His own, to vindicate them, right their wrongs, do them justice, and deliver them from their adversaries.
He does this because of His justice, His holiness, and His hatred of sin; in answering prayer, He keeps His promises and displays His power.
Jesus gives another illustration of prayer in Luke 11:5-12.
Similar to the parable of the unjust judge, Jesus’ message in this passage is that if a man will inconvenience himself to provide for a needy friend, God will provide for our needs far more, since no request is an inconvenience to Him.
Here again, the promise is not that we will receive whatever we ask if we just keep asking.
God’s promise to His children is a promise to meet our needs, not our wants.
And He knows our needs better than we do.
The same promise is reiterated in Matthew 7:7-11 and in Luke 11:13, where the “good gift” is further explained to be the Holy Spirit.
Both of these passages encourage us to pray and to keep praying.
Sometimes God forces us to wait for an answer to our prayers in order to teach us patience and perseverance.
As long as what you are praying for is within the will of God (James 4:3; 1 John 5:14-15), keep asking until God grants your request or removes the desire from your heart.

 For a Christian, dating a non-Christian is unwise, and marrying one is not an option.
Second Corinthians 6:14 (KJV) tells us not to be “unequally yoked” with an unbeliever.
The imagery is of two incompatible oxen sharing the same yoke.
Instead of working together to pull the load, they would be working against each other.
While this passage does not specifically mention marriage, it definitely has implications for marriage.
The passage goes on to say that there is no harmony between Christ and Belial (Satan).
There can be no spiritual harmony in a marriage between a Christian and a non-Christian.
Paul goes on to remind believers that they are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, who inhabits their hearts at salvation (2 Corinthians 6:15-17).
Because of that, they are to be separate from the world—in the world, but not of the world—and nowhere is that more important than in life’s most intimate relationship—marriage.
The Bible also says, “Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character’” (1 Corinthians 15:33).
Having any kind of intimate relationship with an unbeliever can quickly turn into something that is a hindrance to your walk with Christ.
We are called to evangelize the lost, not be intimate with them.
There is nothing wrong with building quality friendships with unbelievers, but that is as far as it should go.
How could a quality marriage be built and maintained if you disagree on the most crucial issue in the universe—the Lord Jesus Christ?
 Questions about Marriage
Paul goes on to remind believers that they are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, who inhabits their hearts at salvation (2 Corinthians 6:15-17).
                                                                                         Answer
 The answer to this question depends somewhat on what is meant by “living together.” If it means having sexual relations, it is definitely wrong.
 The answer to this question depends somewhat on what is meant by “living together.” If it means having sexual relations, it is definitely wrong.
Premarital sex is repeatedly condemned in Scripture, along with all other forms of sexual immorality (Acts 15:20; Romans 1:29; 1 Corinthians 5:1; 6:13, 18; 7:2; 10:8; 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Jude 7).
The Bible tells us to flee immorality, not expose ourselves to constant temptations to immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18).
Sex before marriage is just as wrong as adultery and other forms of sexual immorality, because they all involve having sex with someone you are not married to.
If “living together” means living in the same house, that is perhaps a different issue.
Technically, there is nothing wrong with a man and a woman living in the same house—if there is nothing immoral taking place.
However, the problem arises in that there is still the appearance of immorality (1 Thessalonians 5:22; Ephesians 5:3), and it could be a tremendous temptation for immorality.
The Bible tells us to flee immorality, not expose ourselves to constant temptations to immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18).
The Bible tells us to flee immorality, not expose ourselves to constant temptations to immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18).
A couple who is living together is assumed to be sleeping together—that is just the nature of things.
Even though living in the same house is not sinful in and of itself, the appearance of sin is there.
The Bible tells us to avoid the appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22; Ephesians 5:3), to flee from immorality, and not to cause anyone to stumble or be offended.
As a result, it is not honoring to God for a man and a woman to live together outside of marriage.

Many questions are put to God in the Psalms (Psalms 10, 44, 74, 77).
“And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him” (Hebrews 11:6).
After King Saul had disobeyed God, his questions went unanswered (1 Samuel 28:6).
Our heart attitude is what determines whether it is right or wrong to question God.

It is correct that the Bible never records Jesus saying the precise words, “I am God.” This does not mean, however, that Jesus never claimed to be God.
 Some who deny that Jesus is God make the claim that Jesus never said that He is God.
 Take for example the words of Jesus in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” We need only to look at the Jews’ reaction to His statement to know He was claiming to be God.
These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh.
Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth … before Abraham was born, I am!” This is a reference back to Exodus 3:14 when God revealed Himself as the “I AM.” The Jews who heard this statement responded by taking up stones to kill Him for blasphemy, as the Mosaic Law commanded (Leviticus 24:16).
 Some who deny that Jesus is God make the claim that Jesus never said that He is God.
It is correct that the Bible never records Jesus saying the precise words, “I am God.” This does not mean, however, that Jesus never claimed to be God.
Thomas the disciple declared concerning Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28).
 Take for example the words of Jesus in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” We need only to look at the Jews’ reaction to His statement to know He was claiming to be God.
In Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10).
If Jesus were not God, He would have told people to not worship Him, just as the angel in Revelation did.
 John reiterates the concept of Jesus’ deity: “The Word [Jesus] was God” and “the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14).
 John reiterates the concept of Jesus’ deity: “The Word [Jesus] was God” and “the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14).
These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh.
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Therefore, Jesus is God.

Titus 2:13 encourages us to wait for the coming of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ (see also 2 Peter 1:1).
In Hebrews 1:8, the Father declares of Jesus, “But about the Son He says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.’” The Father refers to Jesus as God, indicating that Jesus is indeed God.
Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth … before Abraham was born, I am!” This is a reference back to Exodus 3:14 when God revealed Himself as the “I AM.” The Jews who heard this statement responded by taking up stones to kill Him for blasphemy, as the Mosaic Law commanded (Leviticus 24:16).
In Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10).
Several times in Scripture Jesus receives worship (Matthew 2:11; 14:33; 28:9, 17; Luke 24:52; John 9:38).
He never rebukes people for worshiping Him.
 The most important reason that Jesus must be God is that, if He is not God, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).
Beyond these, there are many other passages of Scripture that argue for Jesus being God.
    What are the strongest biblical arguments for the divinity of Christ?
 The most important reason that Jesus must be God is that, if He is not God, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).
Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death.

 Yes, Jesus is the only way to heaven.
Such an exclusive statement may confuse, surprise, or even offend, but it is true nonetheless.
The Bible teaches that there is no other way to salvation than through Jesus Christ.
Jesus Himself says in John 14:6, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me.” He is not a way, as in one of many; He is the way, as in the one and only.
No one, regardless of reputation, achievement, special knowledge, or personal holiness, can come to God the Father except through Jesus.
Jesus is the only way to heaven for several reasons.
Jesus was “chosen by God” to be the Savior (1 Peter 2:4).
Jesus is the only One to have come down from heaven and returned there (John 3:13).
He is the only person to have lived a perfect human life (Hebrews 4:15).
He is the only sacrifice for sin (1 John 2:2; Hebrews 10:26).
He alone fulfilled the Law and the Prophets (Matthew 5:17).
He is the only man to have conquered death forever (Hebrews 2:14–15).
He is the only Mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5).
He is the only man whom God has “exalted .
.
.
to the highest place” (Philippians 2:9).
Jesus spoke of Himself as the only way to heaven in several places besides John 14:6.
He presented Himself as the object of faith in Matthew 7:21–27.
He said His words are life (John 6:63).
He promised that those who believe in Him will have eternal life (John 3:14–15).
He is the gate of the sheep (John 10:7); the bread of life (John 6:35); and the resurrection (John 11:25).
No one else can rightly claim those titles.
The apostles’ preaching focused on the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
Peter, speaking to the Sanhedrin, clearly proclaimed Jesus as the only way to heaven: “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).
Paul, speaking to the synagogue in Antioch, singled out Jesus as the Savior: “I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin” (Acts 13:38–39).
John, writing to the church at large, specifies the name of Christ as the basis of our forgiveness: “I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name” (1 John 2:12).
No one but Jesus can forgive sin.
Eternal life in heaven is made possible only through Christ.
Jesus prayed, “Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent” (John 17:3).
To receive God’s free gift of salvation, we must look to Jesus and Jesus alone.
We must trust in Jesus’ death on the cross as our payment for sin and in His resurrection.
“This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe” (Romans 3:22).
At one point in Jesus’ ministry, many of the crowd were turning their backs on Him and leaving in hopes of finding another savior.
Jesus asked the Twelve, “Do you want to go away as well?” (John 6:67, ESV).
Peter’s reply is exactly right: “Lord, to whom shall we go?
You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God” (John 6:68–69, ESV).
May we all share Peter’s faith that eternal life resides only in Jesus Christ.

 Questions about Salvation
                                                                                         Answer
  (a) Romans 8:30 declares, "And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified."
There is nothing that can prevent a believer from one day being glorified because God has already purposed it in heaven.
(b) Paul asks two crucial questions in Romans 8:33-34 "Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
No one will, because Christ, the One who died for us, is the one who condemns.
(d) The Holy Spirit indwells all believers (John 14:17; Romans 8:9) and baptizes all believers into the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13).
(f) In a conclusive argument, Scripture says, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 8:38–39).
To be clear, salvation is more than saying a prayer or “making a decision” for Christ; salvation is a sovereign act of God whereby an unregenerate sinner is washed, renewed, and born again by the Holy Spirit (John 3:3; Titus 3:5).
                                                                                         Answer
Hence, if you lose your salvation, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in error.
                                                                                         Answer
The question of faith alone or faith plus works is made difficult by some hard-to-reconcile Bible passages.
If a person claims to be a believer, but has no good works in his/her life, then he/she likely does not have genuine faith in Christ (James 2:14, 17, 20, 26).
Paul expects just as much of a changed life as James does: “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
                                                                                         Answer
This question is the cause of the Reformation, the split between the Protestant churches and Catholic Church.
                                                                                         Answer
 There are three occasions in the book of Acts where speaking in tongues accompanied the receiving of the Holy Spirit—Acts 2:4, 10:44-46, and 19:6.
However, these three occasions are the only places in the Bible where speaking in tongues is an evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit.
Throughout the book of Acts, thousands of people believe in Jesus and nothing is said about them speaking in tongues (Acts 2:41, 8:5-25, 16:31-34, 21:20).
Nowhere in the New Testament is it taught that speaking in tongues is the only evidence that a person has received the Holy Spirit.
In fact, the New Testament teaches the opposite.
We are told that every believer in Christ has the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 1:13-14), but not every believer speaks in tongues (1 Corinthians 12:29-31).
Acts 2 records the apostles being baptized in the Holy Spirit and empowered by Him to proclaim the gospel.
The apostles were enabled to speak in other languages (tongues) so they could share the truth with people in their own languages.
Acts 10 records the apostle Peter being sent to share the gospel with non-Jewish people.
Peter and the other early Christians, being Jews, would have a hard time accepting Gentiles (non-Jewish people) into the church.
God enabled the Gentiles to speak in tongues to demonstrate that they had received the same Holy Spirit the apostles had received (Acts 10:47, 11:17).
Acts 10:44-47 describes this: “While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.
The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.
Then Peter said, 'Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water?
'“ Peter later refers back to this occasion as proof that God was indeed saving the Gentiles (Acts 15:7-11).
Speaking in tongues is nowhere presented as something all Christians should expect when they receive Jesus Christ as their Savior and are therefore baptized in the Holy Spirit.
In fact, out of all the conversion accounts in the New Testament, only two record speaking in tongues in that context.
Tongues was a miraculous gift that had a specific purpose for a specific time.
It was not, and never has been, the only evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit.
 Questions about the Holy Spirit
The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.
                                                                                         Answer
 Hebrews 4:12 says, “For the word of God is living and active.
Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.” While the Bible was completed approximately 1900 years ago, its accuracy and relevance for today remain unchanged.

The Bible is the sole objective source of all the revelation God has given us about Himself and His plan for humanity.
The Bible contains a great deal of information about the natural world that has been confirmed by scientific observations and research.
Some of these passages include Leviticus 17:11; Ecclesiastes 1:6-7; Job 36:27-29; Psalm 102:25-27 and Colossians 1:16-17.
As the Bible’s story of God’s redemptive plan for humanity unfolds, many different characters are vividly described.
In those descriptions, the Bible provides a great deal of information about human behavior and tendencies.
Our own day-to-day experience shows us that this information is more accurate and descriptive of the human condition than any psychology textbook.
Many historical facts recorded in the Bible have been confirmed by extra-biblical sources.
Historical research often shows a great deal of agreement between biblical accounts and extra-biblical accounts of the same events.
However, the Bible is not a history book, a psychology text, or a scientific journal.
The Bible is the description God gave us about who He is, and His desires and plans for humanity.
The most significant component of this revelation is the story of our separation from God by sin and God’s provision for restoration of fellowship through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ, on the cross.

 Questions about the Bible
The Bible’s most important message—redemption—is universally and perpetually applicable to humanity.
                                                                                         Answer
 Our answer to this question will not only determine how we view the Bible and its importance to our lives, but also it will ultimately have an eternal impact on us.
If the Bible is truly God’s Word, then we should cherish it, study it, obey it, and fully trust it.
If the Bible is the Word of God, then to dismiss it is to dismiss God Himself.
The fact that God gave us the Bible is an evidence and illustration of His love for us.
The term “revelation” simply means that God communicated to mankind what He is like and how we can have a right relationship with Him.
These are things that we could not have known had God not divinely revealed them to us in the Bible.
Although God’s revelation of Himself in the Bible was given progressively over approximately 1500 years, it has always contained everything man needs to know about God in order to have a right relationship with Him.
If the Bible is truly the Word of God, then it is the final authority for all matters of faith, religious practice, and morals.
The question we must ask ourselves is how can we know that the Bible is the Word of God and not just a good book?
If the Bible is truly the Word of God, then it is the final authority for all matters of faith, religious practice, and morals.
Is there any evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word?
These types of questions must be seriously examined if we are to determine the validity of the Bible’s claim to be the very Word of God, divinely inspired, and totally sufficient for all matters of faith and practice.
This is clearly seen in Paul’s commendation to Timothy: “… from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:15-17).
There are both internal and external evidences that the Bible is truly God’s Word.
The internal evidences are those things within the Bible that testify of its divine origin.
One of the first internal evidences that the Bible is truly God’s Word is seen in its unity.
Even though it is really sixty-six individual books, written on three continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years, by more than 40 authors who came from many walks of life, the Bible remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction.
Even though it is really sixty-six individual books, written on three continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years, by more than 40 authors who came from many walks of life, the Bible remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction.
This unity is unique from all other books and is evidence of the divine origin of the words which God moved men to record.
Another of the internal evidences that indicates the Bible is truly God’s Word is the prophecies contained within its pages.
Another of the internal evidences that indicates the Bible is truly God’s Word is the prophecies contained within its pages.
The Bible contains hundreds of detailed prophecies relating to the future of individual nations including Israel, certain cities, and mankind.
The Bible contains hundreds of detailed prophecies relating to the future of individual nations including Israel, certain cities, and mankind.
Unlike the prophecies found in other religious books or those by men such as Nostradamus, biblical prophecies are extremely detailed.
There are over three hundred prophecies concerning Jesus Christ in the Old Testament.
Not only was it foretold where He would be born and His lineage, but also how He would die and that He would rise again.
There simply is no logical way to explain the fulfilled prophecies in the Bible other than by divine origin.
There is no other religious book with the extent or type of predictive prophecy that the Bible contains.
A third internal evidence of the divine origin of the Bible is its unique authority and power.
While this evidence is more subjective than the first two, it is no less a powerful testimony of the divine origin of the Bible.
The Bible’s authority is unlike any other book ever written.
This authority and power are best seen in the way countless lives have been transformed by the supernatural power of God’s Word.
Drug addicts have been cured by it, homosexuals set free by it, derelicts and deadbeats transformed by it, hardened criminals reformed by it, sinners rebuked by it, and hate turned to love by it.
The Bible does possess a dynamic and transforming power that is only possible because it is truly God’s Word.
There are also external evidences that indicate the Bible is truly the Word of God.
There are also external evidences that indicate the Bible is truly the Word of God.
One is the historicity of the Bible.
The fact that the Bible accurately and truthfully records historically verifiable events is a great indication of its truthfulness when dealing with religious subjects and doctrines and helps substantiate its claim to be the very Word of God.
Through both archaeological evidences and other writings, the historical accounts of the Bible have been proven time and time again to be accurate and true.
In fact, all the archaeological and manuscript evidence supporting the Bible makes it the best-documented book from the ancient world.
The fact that the Bible accurately and truthfully records historically verifiable events is a great indication of its truthfulness when dealing with religious subjects and doctrines and helps substantiate its claim to be the very Word of God.
Another external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the integrity of its human authors.
As mentioned earlier, God used men from many walks of life to record His words.
In studying the lives of these men, we find them to be honest and sincere.
The men who wrote the New Testament and many hundreds of other believers (1 Corinthians 15:6) knew the truth of their message because they had seen and spent time with Jesus Christ after He had risen from the dead.
Seeing the risen Christ had a tremendous impact on them.
Their lives and deaths testify to the fact that the Bible truly is God’s Word.
A final external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the indestructibility of the Bible.
A final external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the indestructibility of the Bible.
Because of its importance and its claim to be the very Word of God, the Bible has suffered more vicious attacks and attempts to destroy it than any other book in history.
From early Roman Emperors like Diocletian, through communist dictators and on to modern-day atheists and agnostics, the Bible has withstood and outlasted all of its attackers and is still today the most widely published book in the world.

Throughout time, skeptics have regarded the Bible as mythological, but archeology has confirmed it as historical.
Opponents have attacked its teaching as primitive and outdated, but its moral and legal concepts and teachings have had a positive influence on societies and cultures throughout the world.
No matter how its opponents try to attack, destroy, or discredit it, the Bible remains; its veracity and impact on lives is unmistakable.

The accuracy which has been preserved despite every attempt to corrupt, attack, or destroy it is clear testimony to the fact that the Bible is truly God’s Word and is supernaturally protected by Him.

 Crucial Questions
 What is the Bible?
                                                                                         Answer
 Job, speaking out of his despair, asked, “If a man dies, shall he live again?” (Job 14:14, ESV).
All of us have been challenged by this question.
Is there life after death?
What happens to us after we die?
Do we simply cease to exist?
Is death a revolving door of departing and returning to earth?
Does everyone go to the same place after death, or do we go to different places?
Is there really a heaven and hell?
The Bible tells us that, yes, there is life after death.
This world is not all there is, and mankind was made for something more.
At death, the body ceases to function and begins the process of returning to the earth, but the spiritual part of man lives on: “The dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7; cf.
Psalm 146:4).
To those who are redeemed and have their sin forgiven, God gives eternal life, an existence so glorious that “no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9, NLT).
This eternal life is inextricably linked to the Person of Jesus Christ: “Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent” (John 17:3).
In Jesus’ prayer in this passage, He equates “eternal life” with a knowledge of God and of the Son.
“Whoever has the Son has life” (1 John 5:12).
Jesus Christ, God incarnate, came to the earth to pay for our sins and give us the gift of eternal life: “He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).
Three days after His crucifixion, Jesus proved Himself victorious over death by rising from the grave—He is life personified (John 11:25) and the ultimate proof that there is life after death.
The resurrection of the Christ is a well-documented event.
The apostle Paul invited people to question the over 500 eyewitnesses who saw Jesus after His resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:6).
All of them could bear testimony to the fact that Jesus is alive and that there is indeed life after death.
The resurrection of Christ, which gives us the sure hope of life after death, is the cornerstone of the Christian faith (1 Corinthians 15:12–19).
Because Christ was raised from the dead, we have faith that we, too, will be resurrected.
As Jesus told His disciples, “Because I live, you also will live” (John 14:19).
Christ was only the first of a great harvest of those who will be raised to life again (1 Corinthians 15:23).
Just as God raised up Jesus’ body, so will our bodies be resurrected upon Jesus’ return (1 Corinthians 6:14).
The fact of life after death does not mean everyone will go to heaven, however.
People will continue to exist after they die, and there will be a resurrection someday, but God makes a distinction between the resurrection of the just (those who are in Christ) and the unjust (those who die in their sin): “Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt” (Daniel 12:2).
Paul put it this way: “There will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked” (Acts 24:15).
Each person must make a choice in this life, a choice that will determine his or her eternal destination.
It is appointed for us to die once, and after that will come judgment (Hebrews 9:27).
Those who have been made righteous by faith in Christ will go into eternal life in heaven, but those who have rejected Christ as Savior will be sent to eternal punishment in hell (Matthew 25:46).
Hell, like heaven, is a literal place.
It is a place where the unrighteous will experience the never-ending, eternal wrath of God.
Hell is described as a lake of fire where the inhabitants will be tormented day and night forever and ever (Revelation 20:10).
In hell, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, indicating intense grief and anger (Matthew 13:42).
God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked but desires them to turn from their wicked ways so that they can live (Ezekiel 33:11).
But He will not force us into submission; if we choose to reject Christ, the one and only Savior, we reject the heaven that He has prepared, and we will live eternally apart from Him.
Life on earth is a preparation for what is to come.
Faith in Christ prepares us for life after death: “Whoever believes in [God’s Son] is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son” (John 3:18).
Everyone will experience life after death in some manner.
For believers in Christ, life after death is eternal life in heaven with God.
For unbelievers, life after death is eternity in the lake of fire.
How can we receive eternal life and avoid hell?
There is only one way—through faith in Jesus Christ.
Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life.
The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die” (John 11:25–26).
The free gift of eternal life is available to all.
“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them” (John 3:36).
We will not be given the opportunity to accept God’s gift of salvation after death.
Our eternal destination is determined in our earthly lifetimes by our reception or rejection of Jesus Christ.
“I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation” (2 Corinthians 6:2).
If we trust in the death of Jesus Christ as the full payment for our sin, and we believe in His resurrection from the dead, we are guaranteed eternal life after death, in glory (1 Peter 1:3–5).
Is there an afterlife?

Truth, according to the dictionary, is “conformity to fact or actuality; a statement proven to be or accepted as true.” Some people would say that there is no true reality, only perceptions and opinions.
It is not uncommon today for people to believe that two diametrically opposed religions could both be equally “true,” even though both religions claim to have the only way to heaven or teach two totally opposite “truths.” People who do not believe in absolute truth ignore these claims and embrace a more tolerant universalism that teaches all religions are equal and all roads lead to heaven.

For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools” (Romans 1:19-22).
The Bible describes the role of the human conscience in Romans 2:14-16: “Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.
This will take place on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.”
Yes.

Through religion, humans seek God, hope for the future, forgiveness of sins, peace in the midst of struggle, and answers to our deepest questions.
The fact that absolute truth does exist points us to the truth that there is a sovereign God who created the heavens and the earth and who has revealed Himself to us in order that we might know Him personally through His Son Jesus Christ.

 Scripture presents conclusive evidence that Jesus Christ was in fact resurrected from the dead.
Christ’s resurrection is recorded in Matthew 28:1-20; Mark 16:1-20; Luke 24:1-53; and John 20:1–21:25.
The resurrected Christ also appeared in the Book of Acts (Acts 1:1-11).
From these passages you can gain several “proofs” of Christ’s resurrection.

They went from a group of men frightened and in hiding to strong, courageous witnesses sharing the gospel throughout the world.
If Christ were not raised, then where is His body?
When they returned, His body was not there.
Angels declared that He had been raised from the dead as He had promised (Matthew 28:5-7).
Fourth, additional evidence of His resurrection is the many people He appeared to (Matthew 28:5, 9, 16-17; Mark 16:9; Luke 24:13-35; John 20:19, 24, 26-29, 21:1-14; Acts 1:6-8; 1 Corinthians 15:5-7).
Another proof of the resurrection of Jesus is the great amount of weight the apostles gave to Jesus’ resurrection.
A key passage on Christ’s resurrection is 1 Corinthians 15.
In this chapter, the apostle Paul explains why it is crucial to understand and believe in Christ’s resurrection.
The resurrection is important for the following reasons: 1) If Christ was not raised from the dead, believers will not be either (1 Corinthians 15:12-15).
2) If Christ was not raised from the dead, His sacrifice for sin was not sufficient (1 Corinthians 15:16-19).
Jesus’ resurrection proved that His death was accepted by God as the atonement for our sins.
If He had simply died and stayed dead, that would indicate His sacrifice was not sufficient.
As a result, believers would not be forgiven for their sins, and they would remain dead after they die (1 Corinthians 15:16-19).
There would be no such thing as eternal life (John 3:16).
“But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20 NAS).
Finally, Scripture is clear that all those who believe in Jesus Christ will be raised to eternal life just as He was (1 Corinthians 15:20-23).
First Corinthians 15 goes on to describe how Christ’s resurrection proves His victory over sin and provides us the power to live victoriously over sin (1 Corinthians 15:24-34).
It describes the glorious nature of the resurrection body we will receive (1 Corinthians 15:35-49).
First Corinthians 15 goes on to describe how Christ’s resurrection proves His victory over sin and provides us the power to live victoriously over sin (1 Corinthians 15:24-34).
Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain” (1 Corinthians 15:58).
According to the Bible, the resurrection of Jesus Christ is most definitely true.
The Bible records Christ’s resurrection, records that over 500 people witnessed the resurrected Christ, and proceeds to build crucial Christian doctrine on the historical fact of Jesus’ resurrection.

Many people believe that all roads—all religions and beliefs—lead to heaven, or they consider that God is so full of love and mercy that He will allow all people into heaven.
Acts 4:12 says, “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.” “There is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5).
No one comes to the Father except through me.” John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” If we choose to reject God’s Son, we do not meet the requirements for salvation (John 3:16, 18, 36).

To say that those who reject God’s provision of salvation through His Son will be saved is to belittle the holiness and justice of God and negate the need of Jesus’ sacrifice on our behalf.

Jesus’ own words confirm that the time spent in heaven for the redeemed will last as long as that of the unredeemed in hell.
                                                                                         Answer
The corresponding principle is that the wife should obey God and submit to her own husband “as to the Lord” (Ephesians 5:22).
This is a principle that should be in force before the marriage begins.
Another principle that would protect the longevity of a marriage is that the husband should obey God and love, honor, and protect his wife as he would his own body (Ephesians 5:25–31).
Building on the foundation of a godly marriage, many couples find practical ways to help make their marriages last: spending quality time together; saying, “I love you” often; being kind; showing affection; offering compliments; going on dates; writing notes; giving gifts; and being ready to forgive, for example.
 What can a married couple do to ensure that their marriage will last?
This is a principle that should be in force before the marriage begins.
God says, “Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?” (Amos 3:3).
For the born-again believer, this means not beginning a close relationship with anyone who is not also a believer.
Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14).
If this one principle were followed, it would save a lot of heartache and suffering later in marriages.
Another principle that would protect the longevity of a marriage is that the husband should obey God and love, honor, and protect his wife as he would his own body (Ephesians 5:25–31).
The corresponding principle is that the wife should obey God and submit to her own husband “as to the Lord” (Ephesians 5:22).
The marriage between a man and a woman is a picture of the relationship between Christ and the church.
Christ gave Himself for the church, and He loves, honors, and protects her as His “bride” (Revelation 19:7–9).
When God brought Eve to Adam in the first marriage, she was made from his “flesh and bone” (Genesis 2:21) and they became “one flesh” (Genesis 2:23–24).
Becoming one flesh means more than just a physical union.
It means a meeting of the mind and soul to form one unit.
This relationship goes far beyond sensual or emotional attraction and into the realm of spiritual “oneness” that can only be found as both partners surrender to God and each other.
This relationship is not centered on “me and my” but on “us and our.” This is one of the secrets to a lasting marriage.
Solidifying one’s vertical relationship with God goes a long way toward ensuring the horizontal relationship between a husband and wife is a lasting, God-honoring one.
Making a marriage last for a lifetime is something both partners have to make a priority.
Solidifying one’s vertical relationship with God goes a long way toward ensuring the horizontal relationship between a husband and wife is a lasting, God-honoring one.

One of the principal arguments for Friday is found in Mark 15:42, which notes that Jesus was crucified “the day before the Sabbath.” If that was the weekly Sabbath, i.e.
Since Jesus was in the grave for part of Friday, all of Saturday, and part of Sunday—He could be considered to have been in the grave for three days.
Some, however, using a synthesis of both the Friday and Wednesday arguments, argue for Thursday as the day.
Jesus said in Matthew 12:40, “For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” Those who argue for a Friday crucifixion say that there is still a valid way in which He could have been considered in the grave for three days.
Since Jesus was in the grave for part of Friday, all of Saturday, and part of Sunday—He could be considered to have been in the grave for three days.
In the Jewish mind of the first century, a part of day was considered as a full day.

One of the principal arguments for Friday is found in Mark 15:42, which notes that Jesus was crucified “the day before the Sabbath.” If that was the weekly Sabbath, i.e.
Another argument for Friday says that verses such as Matthew 16:21 and Luke 9:22 teach that Jesus would rise on the third day; therefore, He would not need to be in the grave a full three days and nights.
But while some translations use “on the third day” for these verses, not all do, and not everyone agrees that “on the third day” is the best way to translate these verses.
Furthermore, Mark 8:31 says that Jesus will be raised “after” three days.
The Thursday argument expands on the Friday view and argues mainly that there are too many events (some count as many as twenty) happening between Christ’s burial and Sunday morning to occur from Friday evening to Sunday morning.
Proponents of the Thursday view point out that this is especially a problem when the only full day between Friday and Sunday was Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.
An extra day or two eliminates that problem.
The Thursday advocates could reason thus: suppose you haven't seen a friend since Monday evening.
The next time you see him it is Thursday morning and you say, “I haven’t seen you in three days” even though it had technically only been 60 hours (2.5 days).
If Jesus was crucified on Thursday, this example shows how it could be considered three days.
The Wednesday opinion states that there were two Sabbaths that week.
After the first one (the one that occurred on the evening of the crucifixion [Mark 15:42; Luke 23:52-54]), the women purchased spices—note that they made their purchase after the Sabbath (Mark 16:1).
The Wednesday view holds that this “Sabbath” was the Passover (see Leviticus 16:29-31, 23:24-32, 39, where high holy days that are not necessarily the seventh day of the week are referred to as the Sabbath).
Note that in Luke 23:56 the women who had purchased spices after the first Sabbath returned and prepared the spices, then “rested on the Sabbath.” The argument states that they could not purchase the spices after the Sabbath, yet prepare those spices before the Sabbath—unless there were two Sabbaths.

With the two-Sabbath view, if Christ was crucified on Thursday, then the high holy Sabbath (the Passover) would have begun Thursday at sundown and ended at Friday sundown—at the beginning of the weekly Sabbath or Saturday.
Purchasing the spices after the first Sabbath (Passover) would have meant they purchased them on Saturday and were breaking the Sabbath.
Therefore, according to the Wednesday viewpoint, the only explanation that does not violate the biblical account of the women and the spices and holds to a literal understanding of Matthew 12:40 is that Christ was crucified on Wednesday.
The Sabbath that was a high holy day (Passover) occurred on Thursday, the women purchased spices (after that) on Friday and returned and prepared the spices on the same day, they rested on Saturday which was the weekly Sabbath, then brought the spices to the tomb early Sunday.
Jesus was buried near sundown on Wednesday, which began Thursday in the Jewish calendar.
Thursday night (night one), Friday day (day two), Friday night (night two), Saturday day (day three), Saturday night (night three).
With the two-Sabbath view, if Christ was crucified on Thursday, then the high holy Sabbath (the Passover) would have begun Thursday at sundown and ended at Friday sundown—at the beginning of the weekly Sabbath or Saturday.
A possible problem with the Wednesday view is that the disciples who walked with Jesus on the road to Emmaus did so on “the same day” of His resurrection (Luke 24:13).
The disciples, who do not recognize Jesus, tell Him of Jesus’ crucifixion (24:21) and say that “today is the third day since these things happened” (24:22).
Wednesday to Sunday is four days.
A possible explanation is that they may have been counting since Wednesday evening at Christ’s burial, which begins the Jewish Thursday, and Thursday to Sunday could be counted as three days.
In the grand scheme of things, it is not all that important to know what day of the week Christ was crucified.
If it were very important, then God’s Word would have clearly communicated the day and timeframe.
What is important is that He did die and that He physically, bodily rose from the dead.
What is equally important is the reason He died—to take the punishment that all sinners deserve.
John 3:16 and 3:36 both proclaim that putting your trust in Him results in eternal life!

First Timothy 4:8 informs us, “For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.” Notice that the verse does not negate the need for exercise.
Rather, it says that exercise is valuable, but it prioritizes exercise correctly by saying that godliness is of greater value.
The apostle Paul also mentions physical training in illustrating spiritual truth in 1 Corinthians 9:24-27.
In 2 Timothy 2:5, Paul says, “Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor’s crown unless he competes according to the rules.” Paul uses an athletic analogy again in 2 Timothy 4:7: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” While the focus of these Scriptures is not physical exercise, the fact that Paul uses athletic terminology to teach us spiritual truths indicates that Paul viewed physical exercise, and even competition, in a positive light.

Those who favor one faith system over another or—even worse—claim a knowledge of absolute truth are considered narrow-minded, unenlightened, or even bigoted.
For example, the Bible makes the claim that “man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment” (Hebrews 9:27), while some Eastern religions teach reincarnation.
Jesus said, “I am the way and the truth and the life.
The Christian has publicly acknowledged that Jesus rose from the dead (Romans 10:9-10).

Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the LORD, but only from the physicians.” The issue was not that Asa consulted physicians, but that “he did not seek help from the LORD.” Even when visiting a doctor, our ultimate faith is to be in God, not the doctor.

There are many verses that speak of using “medical treatments” such as applying bandages (Isaiah 1:6), oil (James 5:14), oil and wine (Luke 10:34), leaves (Ezekiel 47:12), wine (1 Timothy 5:23), and salves, particularly the “balm of Gilead” (Jeremiah 8:22).
Jesus, in answering the Pharisees as to why He spent time with sinners, said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick” (Matthew 9:12).
 1) Physicians are not God and should not be viewed as such.
2) Seeking physicians and using “earthly” remedies are not condemned in Scripture.

Peter also describes the universality of the flood in 2 Peter 3:6-7, where he states, “By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.
Further, many biblical writers accepted the historicity of the worldwide flood (Isaiah 54:9; 1 Peter 3:20; 2 Peter 2:5; Hebrews 11:7).
Lastly, the Lord Jesus Christ believed in the universal flood and took it as the type of the coming destruction of the world when He returns (Matthew 24:37-39; Luke 17:26-27).

 What does the Bible say about uniformitarianism vs. catastrophism?

 The Bible, God’s Word, tells us what God is like and what He is not like.
Without the authority of the Bible, any attempt to explain God’s attributes would be no better than an opinion, which by itself is often incorrect, especially in understanding God (Job 42:7).
To say that it is important for us to try to understand what God is like is a huge understatement.
Failure to do so can cause us to set up, chase after, and worship false gods contrary to His will (Exodus 20:3-5).
Only what God has chosen to reveal of Himself can be known.
One of God’s attributes or qualities is “light,” meaning that He is self-revealing in information of Himself (Isaiah 60:19; James 1:17).
The fact that God has revealed knowledge of Himself should not be neglected (Hebrews 4:1).
Creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh (Jesus Christ) will help us to know what God is like.
Let’s start by understanding that God is our Creator and that we are a part of His creation (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 24:1) and are created in His image.
Man is above the rest of creation and was given dominion over it (Genesis 1:26-28).
Creation is marred by the fall but still offers a glimpse of God’s works (Genesis 3:17-18; Romans 1:19-20).
By considering creation’s vastness, complexity, beauty, and order, we can have a sense of the awesomeness of God.
Reading through some of the names of God can be helpful in our search of what God is like.
They are as follows:
       Yahweh - LORD “I Am,” meaning the eternal self-existent God (Exodus 3:13, 14).
God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and His existence will never end.
He is immortal and infinite (Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2; 1 Timothy 1:17).
God is immutable, meaning He is unchanging; this in turn means that God is absolutely reliable and trustworthy (Malachi 3:6; Numbers 23:19; Psalm 102:26, 27).
God is incomparable; there is no one like Him in works or being.
He is unequaled and perfect (2 Samuel 7:22; Psalm 86:8; Isaiah 40:25; Matthew 5:48).
God is inscrutable, unfathomable, unsearchable, and past finding out as far as understanding Him completely (Isaiah 40:28; Psalm 145:3; Romans 11:33, 34).
God is just; He is no respecter of persons in the sense of showing favoritism (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 18:30).
God is omnipotent; He is all-powerful and can do anything that pleases Him, but His actions will always be in accord with the rest of His character (Revelation 19:6; Jeremiah 32:17, 27).
God is omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere, but this does not mean that God is everything (Psalm 139:7-13; Jeremiah 23:23).
God is omniscient, meaning He knows the past, present, and future, including what we are thinking at any given moment.
Since He knows everything, His justice will always be administered fairly (Psalm 139:1-5; Proverbs 5:21).
God is one; not only is there no other, but He is alone in being able to meet the deepest needs and longings of our hearts.
God alone is worthy of our worship and devotion (Deuteronomy 6:4).
God is righteous, meaning that God cannot and will not pass over wrongdoing.
It is because of God’s righteousness and justice that, in order for our sins to be forgiven, Jesus had to experience God’s wrath when our sins were placed upon Him (Exodus 9:27; Matthew 27:45-46; Romans 3:21-26).
God is sovereign, meaning He is supreme.
All of His creation put together cannot thwart His purposes (Psalm 93:1; 95:3; Jeremiah 23:20).
God is spirit, meaning He is invisible (John 1:18; 4:24).
God is a Trinity.
He is three in one, the same in substance, equal in power and glory.
God is truth, He will remain incorruptible and cannot lie (Psalm 117:2; 1 Samuel 15:29).
God is holy, separated from all moral defilement and hostile toward it.
God sees all evil and it angers Him.
God is referred to as a consuming fire (Isaiah 6:3; Habakkuk 1:13; Exodus 3:2, 4-5; Hebrews 12:29).
God is gracious, and His grace includes His goodness, kindness, mercy, and love.
If it were not for God’s grace, His holiness would exclude us from His presence.
Thankfully, this is not the case, for He desires to know each of us personally (Exodus 34:6; Psalm 31:19; 1 Peter 1:3; John 3:16, 17:3).
Since God is an infinite Being, no human can fully answer this God-sized question, but through God’s Word, we can understand much about who God is and what He is like.
May we all wholeheartedly continue to seek after Him (Jeremiah 29:13).

 The Four Spiritual Laws are a way of sharing the good news of the salvation that is available through faith in Jesus Christ.
It is a simple way of organizing the important information in the Gospel into four points.
The first of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life."
John 3:16 tells us, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."
John 10:10 gives us the reason that Jesus came, "I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."
What is blocking us from God’s love?
What is preventing us from having an abundant life?
The second of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Humanity is tainted by sin and is therefore separated from God.
As a result, we cannot know God’s wonderful plan for our lives."
Romans 3:23 affirms this information, "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
Romans 6:23 gives us the consequences of sin, "the wages of sin is death."
God created us to have fellowship with Him.
However, humanity brought sin into the world, and is therefore separated from God.
We have ruined the relationship with Him that God intended us to have.
What is the solution?
The third of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Jesus Christ is God’s only provision for our sin.
Through Jesus Christ, we can have our sins forgiven and restore a right relationship with God."
Romans 5:8 tells us, "But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 informs us of what we need to know and believe in order to be saved, "...that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures..." Jesus Himself declares that He is the only way of salvation in John 14:6, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me."
How can I receive this wonderful gift of salvation?
The Fourth of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "We must place our faith in Jesus Christ as Savior in order to receive the gift of salvation and know God’s wonderful plan for our lives."
John 1:12 describes this for us, "Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God."
Acts 16:31 says it very clearly, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved!"
We can be saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone (Ephesians 2:8-9).
If you want to trust in Jesus Christ as your Savior, say the following words to God.
Saying these words will not save you, but trusting in Christ will!
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and deserve punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"

The brief description of the new heavens and new earth is the last glimpse into eternity that the Bible gives.
                                                                                         Answer
 According to Catholic theology, the seven deadly sins are seven vices or negative character qualities that, left unchecked, will result in a host of other sins and eventually kill a person’s soul.
A common misconception about the seven deadly sins is that they are sins that God will not forgive.
The Roman Catholic Church does not teach the sins to be unforgivable; in Catholic doctrine, the seven deadly sins can lead to mortal sins, which will send a person to hell immediately upon death, unless such sins are repented of before death.
Proverbs 6:16–19 lists seven things that are detestable to God: 1) haughty eyes, 2) a lying tongue, 3) hands that shed innocent blood, 4) a heart that plots evil, 5) feet that are quick to rush to do wrong, 6) a false witness, and 7) a man who stirs up dissension among brothers.
Of course, this list is not what most people understand as the “seven deadly sins.”
The seven “deadly” sins are pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth.
 Yes, pride, envy, etc., are sins that the Bible condemns; however, they are never called “the seven deadly sins” in the Bible.
The traditional list of seven deadly sins can function as a way to categorize the many different sins that exist.
Nearly every sin could be placed in one of those seven categories.
In the final analysis, no sin is any more “deadly” than any other sin.
All sin results in death (Romans 6:23).
Praise be to God that Jesus Christ took the penalty for all of our sins, including the “seven deadly sins.” By the grace of God, through faith in Christ, we can be forgiven (Matthew 26:28; Acts 10:43; Ephesians 1:7).
                                                                                         Answer

                                                                                         Answer
Because the idea of a step-by-step process to salvation is appealing, many in the Christian community make the mistake of presenting salvation as a result of a step-by-step process.
God promises forgiveness of sins and eternal life in heaven to all who receive, by grace through faith, Jesus Christ as Savior (John 1:12; 3:16; 5:24; Acts 16:31).
God promises forgiveness of sins and eternal life in heaven to all who receive, by grace through faith, Jesus Christ as Savior (John 1:12; 3:16; 5:24; Acts 16:31).
However, these are not steps to salvation.
God promises forgiveness of sins and eternal life in heaven to all who receive, by grace through faith, Jesus Christ as Savior (John 1:12; 3:16; 5:24; Acts 16:31).
                                                                                         Answer
                                                                                         Answer
The Ten Commandments are recorded in the Bible in Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21 and are as follows:
3) “You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.” This is a command against taking the name of the Lord in vain.
3) “You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.” This is a command against taking the name of the Lord in vain.
2) “You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.” This command is against making an idol, a visible representation of God.
 1) “You shall have no other gods before me.” This command is against worshiping any god other than the one true God.
3) “You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.” This is a command against taking the name of the Lord in vain.
3) “You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.” This is a command against taking the name of the Lord in vain.
5) “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.” This is a command to always treat one’s parents with honor and respect.
5) “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.” This is a command to always treat one’s parents with honor and respect.
10) “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house.
Coveting can lead to breaking one of the commandments listed above: murder, adultery, and theft.
7) “You shall not commit adultery.” This is a command against having sexual relations with anyone other than one’s spouse.
8) “You shall not steal.” This is a command against taking anything that is not one’s own, without the permission of the person to whom it belongs.
10) “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house.
8) “You shall not steal.” This is a command against taking anything that is not one’s own, without the permission of the person to whom it belongs.
10) “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house.
Coveting can lead to breaking one of the commandments listed above: murder, adultery, and theft.
In contrast, the purpose of the Ten Commandments is to force people to realize that they cannot perfectly obey the Law (Romans 7:7-11), and are therefore in need of God’s mercy and grace.
                                                                                         Answer
 Did Moses copy the Law from the Code of Hammurabi?
                                                                                         Answer
 It is often claimed that “God instituted the Sabbath in Eden” because of the connection between the Sabbath and creation in Exodus 20:11.
Although God’s rest on the seventh day (Genesis 2:3) did foreshadow a future Sabbath law, there is no biblical record of the Sabbath before the children of Israel left the land of Egypt.
Nowhere in Scripture is there any hint that Sabbath-keeping was practiced from Adam to Moses.
The Word of God makes it quite clear that Sabbath observance was a special sign between God and Israel: “The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.
The Word of God makes it quite clear that Sabbath observance was a special sign between God and Israel: “The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.
It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested” (Exodus 31:16–17).
A person breaking the Sabbath law was to be put to death (Exodus 31:15; Numbers 15:32–35).
In Deuteronomy 5, Moses restates the Ten Commandments to the next generation of Israelites.
Here, after commanding Sabbath observance in verses 12–14, Moses gives the reason the Sabbath was given to the nation Israel: “Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.
God’s intent for giving the Sabbath to Israel was not that they would remember creation, but that they would remember their Egyptian slavery and the Lord’s deliverance.
Note the requirements for Sabbath-keeping: A person placed under that Sabbath law could not leave his home on the Sabbath (Exodus 16:29), he could not build a fire (Exodus 35:3), and he could not cause anyone else to work (Deuteronomy 5:14).
A person breaking the Sabbath law was to be put to death (Exodus 31:15; Numbers 15:32–35).
An examination of New Testament passages shows us four important points: 1) Whenever Christ appears in His resurrected form and the day is mentioned, it is always the first day of the week (Matthew 28:1, 9, 10; Mark 16:9; Luke 24:1, 13, 15; John 20:19, 26).
2) The only times the Sabbath is mentioned from Acts through Revelation, the occasion is Jewish evangelism, and the setting is usually a synagogue (Acts chapters 13–18).
Paul wrote, “To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews” (1 Corinthians 9:20).
Paul did not go to the synagogue to fellowship with and edify the saints, but to convict and save the lost.
3) After Paul states, “From now on I will go to the Gentiles” (Acts 18:6), the Sabbath is never again mentioned.
And 4) Instead of suggesting adherence to the Sabbath day, the remainder of the New Testament implies the opposite (including the one exception to point 3, above, found in Colossians 2:16).
Looking more closely at point 4 above will reveal that there is no obligation for the New Testament believer to keep the Sabbath, and will also show that the idea of a Sunday “Christian Sabbath” is also unscriptural.
As discussed above, there is one time the Sabbath is mentioned after Paul began to focus on the Gentiles, “Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.
These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ” (Colossians 2:16–17).
These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ” (Colossians 2:16–17).
The Jewish Sabbath was abolished at the cross where Christ “canceled the written code, with its regulations” (Colossians 2:14).
This idea is repeated more than once in the New Testament: “One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike.
He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord” (Romans 14:5–6a).
For instance, Acts 20:7 states that “on the first day of the week we came together to break bread.” In 1 Corinthians 16:2 Paul urges the Corinthian believers “on the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income.” Since Paul designates this offering as “service” in 2 Corinthians 9:12, this collection must have been linked with the Sunday worship service of the Christian assembly.
But some claim that a mandate by Constantine in A.D. 321 “changed” the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday.
Historically Sunday, not Saturday, was the normal meeting day for Christians in the church, and its practice dates back to the first century.
However, there are clear passages that mention the first day of the week.
For instance, Acts 20:7 states that “on the first day of the week we came together to break bread.” In 1 Corinthians 16:2 Paul urges the Corinthian believers “on the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income.” Since Paul designates this offering as “service” in 2 Corinthians 9:12, this collection must have been linked with the Sunday worship service of the Christian assembly.

Historically Sunday, not Saturday, was the normal meeting day for Christians in the church, and its practice dates back to the first century.
The Sabbath was given to Israel, not the church.
The Sabbath is still Saturday, not Sunday, and has never been changed.
But the Sabbath is part of the Old Testament Law, and Christians are free from the bondage of the Law (Galatians 4:1-26; Romans 6:14).
Sabbath keeping is not required of the Christian—be it Saturday or Sunday.
The first day of the week, Sunday, the Lord’s Day (Revelation 1:10) celebrates the New Creation, with Christ as our resurrected Head.
We are not obligated to follow the Mosaic Sabbath—resting, but are now free to follow the risen Christ—serving.
The Apostle Paul said that each individual Christian should decide whether to observe a Sabbath rest, “One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike.
We are to worship God every day, not just on Saturday or Sunday.

 Let’s look at how the Bible describes love, and then we will see a few ways in which God is the essence of love.
It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
This is God’s description of love, and because God is love (1 John 4:8), this is what He is like.
In love, God does not force Himself on anyone.
Those who come to Him do so in response to His love.
In love, God shows kindness to all.
In love, Jesus went about doing good to everyone without partiality.
In love, Jesus did not covet what others had, living a humble life without complaining.
In love, Jesus did not brag about who He was in the flesh, although He could have overpowered anyone He ever came in contact with.
In love, God does not force Himself on anyone.
In love, Jesus willingly obeyed His Father in heaven.
“The world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me” (John 14:31).
In love, Jesus was/is always looking out for the interests of others.
The greatest expression of God’s love is communicated to us in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Romans 5:8 proclaims the same message: “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” We can see from these verses that it is God’s greatest desire that we join Him in His eternal home, heaven.

He has made the way possible by paying the price for our sins.
He loves us because He chose to as an act of His will.
Love forgives.
“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).
So, what does it mean that God is love?
Love is a core aspect of God’s character, His Person.
God’s love is in no sense in conflict with His holiness, righteousness, justice, or even His wrath.
All of God’s attributes are in perfect harmony.
Everything God does is loving, just as everything He does is just and right.
God is the perfect example of true love.
Amazingly, God has given those who receive His Son Jesus as their personal Savior the ability to love as He does, through the power of the Holy Spirit (John 1:12; 1 John 3:1, 23-24).

 “But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law” (Galatians 4:4).
1) There was a great anticipation among the Jews of that time that the Messiah would come.
2) Rome had unified much of the world under its government, giving a sense of unity to the various lands.
A “common” form of the Greek language (different from classical Greek) was the trade language and was spoken throughout the empire, making it possible to communicate the gospel to many different people groups through one common language.
At the same time, in the more “cultured” cities, the Greek philosophy and science of the time left others spiritually empty in the same way that the atheism of communist governments leaves a spiritual void today.
5) The mystery religions of the time emphasized a savior-god and required worshipers to offer bloody sacrifices, thus making the gospel of Christ which involved one ultimate sacrifice believable to them.
6) The Roman army recruited soldiers from among the provinces, introducing these men to Roman culture and to ideas (such as the gospel) that had not reached those outlying provinces yet.
The Law was meant to help people understand the depth of their sinfulness (in that they were incapable of keeping the Law) so that they might more readily accept the cure for that sin through Jesus the Messiah (Galatians 3:22-23; Romans 3:19-20).
Daniel 9:24-27 speaks of the “seventy weeks” or the seventy “sevens.” From the context, these “weeks” or “sevens” refer to groups of seven years, not seven days.
A century ago in his book The Coming Prince, Sir Robert Anderson gave detailed calculations of the sixty-nine weeks, using ‘prophetic years,’ allowing for leap years, errors in the calendar, the change from B.C.
The people of every century since then have more than sufficient evidence that Jesus was indeed the promised Messiah through His fulfillment of the Scriptures that pictured and prophesied His coming in great detail.

 Jesus is not God’s Son in the sense of a human father and a son.
God did not get married and have a son.
God did not get married and have a son.
Jesus is God’s Son in the sense that He is God made manifest in human form (John 1:1, 14).
Jesus is God’s Son in that He was conceived in Mary by the Holy Spirit.
Luke 1:35 declares, “The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
 During His trial before the Jewish leaders, the High Priest demanded of Jesus, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God” (Matthew 26:63).
 During His trial before the Jewish leaders, the High Priest demanded of Jesus, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God” (Matthew 26:63).
The Jewish leaders responded by accusing Jesus of blasphemy (Matthew 26:65-66).
‘But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven’” (Matthew 26:64).
The Jewish leaders responded by accusing Jesus of blasphemy (Matthew 26:65-66).
The Jewish leaders responded by accusing Jesus of blasphemy (Matthew 26:65-66).
Later, before Pontius Pilate, “The Jews insisted, ‘We have a law, and according to that law He must die, because He claimed to be the Son of God’” (John 19:7).
The Jewish leaders understood exactly what Jesus meant by the phrase “Son of God.” To be the Son of God is to be of the same nature as God.

The Jewish leaders understood exactly what Jesus meant by the phrase “Son of God.” To be the Son of God is to be of the same nature as God.
The Son of God is “of God.” The claim to be of the same nature as God—to in fact be God—was blasphemy to the Jewish leaders; therefore, they demanded Jesus’ death, in keeping with Leviticus 24:15.
Hebrews 1:3 expresses this very clearly, “The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His being.”
Hebrews 1:3 expresses this very clearly, “The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His being.”
 Another example can be found in John 17:12 where Judas is described as the “son of perdition.” John 6:71 tells us that Judas was the son of Simon.
What does John 17:12 mean by describing Judas as the “son of perdition”?
The word perdition means “destruction, ruin, waste.” Judas was not the literal son of “ruin, destruction, and waste,” but those things were the identity of Judas' life.

Son of Man is a fulfillment of prophecy. Jesus’ claim before the high priest to be the Son of Man was a reference to the prophecy of Daniel 7:13–14, “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven.
His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.” Daniel saw glory, worship, and an everlasting kingdom given to the Messiah—here called the “Son of Man”—and Jesus applied this prophecy to Himself.
Son of Man is a title of humanity. Other titles for Christ, such as Son of God, are overt in their focus on His deity.
Son of Man is a title of humility. The Second Person of the Trinity, eternal in nature, left heaven’s glory and took on human flesh, becoming the Son of Man, born in a manger and “despised and rejected by mankind” (Isaiah 53:3).

God the Son Incarnate: The Doctrine of Christ by Stephen Wellum
                                                                                         Answer
 Jesus saves is a popular slogan on bumper stickers, signs at athletic events, and even banners being pulled across the sky by small airplanes.
And while Jesus was truly a good teacher and a prophet, those job descriptions do not capture who Jesus truly is, nor do they explain how or why Jesus saves.
Since God is the infinite and eternal Creator, all sin is ultimately against Him (Psalm 51:4), and only an infinite and eternal punishment is sufficient.
Jesus Christ sacrificed Himself on our behalf, paying the infinite and eternal penalty only He could pay (2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 John 2:2).
Jesus saves all those who cease trying to save themselves and fully trust in His sacrifice alone as the payment for sin (John 3:16; Acts 16:31).
If you now understand what it means that Jesus saves, and you want to trust in Him as your personal Savior, you can, as an act of faith, communicate the following to God: “God, I know that I am a sinner, and I know that because of my sin I deserve to be eternally separated from you.

                                                                                         Answer
 When people speak of the Bible as inspired, they are referring to the fact that God divinely influenced the human authors of the Scriptures in such a way that what they wrote was the very Word of God.
In the context of the Scriptures, the word “inspiration” simply means “God-breathed.” Inspiration means the Bible truly is the Word of God and makes the Bible unique among all other books.
In the context of the Scriptures, the word “inspiration” simply means “God-breathed.” Inspiration means the Bible truly is the Word of God and makes the Bible unique among all other books.
While there are different views as to the extent to which the Bible is inspired, there can be no doubt that the Bible itself claims that every word in every part of the Bible comes from God (1 Corinthians 2:12-13; 2 Timothy 3:16-17).
Full verbal plenary inspiration is an essential characteristic of the Word of God.
This view of the Scriptures is often referred to as “verbal plenary inspiration.” That means the inspiration extends to the very words themselves (verbal)—not just concepts or ideas—and that the inspiration extends to all parts of Scripture and all subject matters of Scripture (plenary).
Some people believe only parts of the Bible are inspired or only the thoughts or concepts that deal with religion are inspired, but these views of inspiration fall short of the Bible’s claims about itself.
Full verbal plenary inspiration is an essential characteristic of the Word of God.
The extent of inspiration can be clearly seen in 2 Timothy 3:16, “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.” This verse tells us that God inspired all Scripture and that it is profitable to us.
This verse helps us to understand that even though God used men with their distinctive personalities and writing styles, God divinely inspired the very words they wrote.
It is not just the parts of the Bible that deal with religious doctrines that are inspired, but each and every word from Genesis to Revelation.
This verse helps us to understand that even though God used men with their distinctive personalities and writing styles, God divinely inspired the very words they wrote.
The Bible claims not only to be inspired by God, but also to have the supernatural ability to change us and make us “complete.” What more can we need?
Another verse that deals with the inspiration of the Scriptures is 2 Peter 1:21.
I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law...” (Matthew 5:17-18).
In these verses, Jesus is reinforcing the accuracy of the Scriptures down to the smallest detail and the slightest punctuation mark, because it is the very Word of God.

Without a doubt the Bible is what it claims to be—the undeniable, authoritative, Word of God to humanity.
The same verses that establish the inspiration of the Scriptures also establish that it is both inerrant and authoritative.

 The classic passage from the Bible that answers this question is John 3:1-21.
The Lord Jesus Christ is talking to Nicodemus, a prominent Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin (the ruling body of the Jews).
Nicodemus had come to Jesus at night with some questions.
As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, “‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’ ‘How can a man be born when he is old?’ Nicodemus asked.
As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, “‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’ ‘How can a man be born when he is old?’ Nicodemus asked.
‘Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be born!’ Jesus answered, ‘I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.
You should not be surprised at my saying, “You must be born again”’” (John 3:3-7).
The phrase "born again" literally means "born from above."
The Lord Jesus Christ is talking to Nicodemus, a prominent Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin (the ruling body of the Jews).
He needed a change of his heart—a spiritual transformation.
When one is saved, he/she has been born again, spiritually renewed, and is now a child of God by right of new birth.
New birth, being born again, is an act of God whereby eternal life is imparted to the person who believes (2 Corinthians 5:17; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:3; 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1-4, 18).
The question logically comes, "Why does a person need to be born again?"
The apostle Paul in Ephesians 2:1 says, "And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins" (NKJV).
To the Romans he wrote, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
Only those who are born again have their sins forgiven and have a relationship with God.
Ephesians 2:8-9 states, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."
When one is saved, he/she has been born again, spiritually renewed, and is now a child of God by right of new birth.
Trusting in Jesus Christ, the One who paid the penalty of sin when He died on the cross, is the means to be "born again."
"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation: the old has gone, the new has come!"
(2 Corinthians 5:17).
If you have never trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior, will you consider the prompting of the Holy Spirit as He speaks to your heart?
Will you pray the prayer of repentance and become a new creation in Christ today?
Only those who are born again have their sins forgiven and have a relationship with God.
"Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God" (John 1:12-13).
(2 Corinthians 5:17).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and be born again, here is a sample prayer.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness—the gift of eternal life!

If you have never trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior, will you consider the prompting of the Holy Spirit as He speaks to your heart?
                                                                                         Answer
 When the word “quench” is used in Scripture, it is speaking of suppressing fire.
When believers put on the shield of faith, as part of their armor of God (Ephesians 6:16), they are extinguishing the power of the fiery darts from Satan.
Christ described hell as a place where the fire would not be “quenched” (Mark 9:44, 46, 48).
Likewise, the Holy Spirit is a fire dwelling in each believer.
He wants to express Himself in our actions and attitudes.
When believers do not allow the Spirit to be seen in our actions or we do what we know is wrong, we suppress or quench the Spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:19).
We do not allow the Spirit to reveal Himself the way that He wants to.
To understand what it means to grieve the Spirit, we must first understand that this indicates the Spirit possesses personality.
Only a person can be grieved; therefore, the Spirit must be a divine person in order to have this emotion.
Once we understand this, we can better understand how He is grieved, mainly because we too are grieved.
Ephesians 4:30 tells us that we should not grieve the Spirit.
We grieve the Spirit by living like the pagans (4:17-19), by lying (4:25), by being angry (4:26-27), by stealing (4:28), by cursing (4:29), by being bitter (4:31), by being unforgiving (4:32), and by being sexually immoral (5:3-5).
To grieve the Spirit is to act out in a sinful manner, whether it is in thought only or in both thought and deed.
Both quenching and grieving the Spirit are similar in their effects.
The Spirit-Filled Life: Discovering the Joy of Surrendering to the Holy Spirit by Charles Stanley
Both happen when a believer sins against God and follows his or her own worldly desires.
To grieve the Spirit is to act out in a sinful manner, whether it is in thought only or in both thought and deed.
Just as we do not like to be grieved, and just as we do not seek to quench what is good—so we should not grieve or quench the Holy Spirit by refusing to follow His leading.

 Prayer in Jesus’ name is taught in John 14:13-14, “And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.
You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.” Some misapply this verse, thinking that saying “in Jesus’ name” at the end of a prayer results in God’s always granting what is asked for.
You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.” Some misapply this verse, thinking that saying “in Jesus’ name” at the end of a prayer results in God’s always granting what is asked for.
This is essentially treating the words “in Jesus’ name” as a magic formula.
This is essentially treating the words “in Jesus’ name” as a magic formula.
Praying in Jesus’ name means praying with His authority and asking God the Father to act upon our prayers because we come in the name of His Son, Jesus.
Praying in Jesus’ name means the same thing as praying according to the will of God, “This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him” (1 John 5:14-15).
And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him” (1 John 5:14-15).
Praying in Jesus’ name is praying for things that will honor and glorify Jesus.
Saying “in Jesus’ name” at the end of a prayer is not a magic formula.
If what we ask for or say in prayer is not for God’s glory and according to His will, saying “in Jesus’ name” is meaningless.
Genuinely praying in Jesus’ name and for His glory is what is important, not attaching certain words to the end of a prayer.
It is not the words in the prayer that matter, but the purpose behind the prayer.
Praying for things that are in agreement with God’s will is the essence of praying in Jesus’ name.

The Prayer That Turns the World Upside Down: The Lord’s Prayer as a Manifesto for Revolution by R. Albert Mohler Jr.
                                                                                         Answer
 Believers have the indwelling Spirit of Christ, the Comforter who proceeds from the Father (John 15:26).
The Holy Spirit assists believers in prayer (Jude 1:20) and “intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God” (Romans 8:27).
He also leads the believer into righteousness (Galatians 5:16–18) and produces His fruit in those yielded to Him (Galatians 5:22–23).
Believers are to submit to the will of God and walk in the Spirit.
A “walk” in the Bible is often a metaphor for practical daily living.
The Christian life is a journey, and we are to walk it—we are to make consistent forward progress.
The biblical norm for all believers is that they walk in the Spirit: “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25, KJV; cf.
In other words, the Spirit gave us life in the new birth (John 3:6), and we must continue to live, day by day, in the Spirit.
To walk in the Spirit means that we yield to His control, we follow His lead, and we allow Him to exert His influence over us.
To walk in the Spirit is the opposite of resisting Him or grieving Him (Ephesians 4:30).
Galatians 5 examines the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer.
The context is freedom from the Law of Moses (Galatians 5:1).
Those who walk in the Spirit “eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope” (verse 5) and are free from the Law (verse 18).
Also, those who walk in the Spirit “will not gratify the desires of the flesh” (verse 16).
The flesh—our fallen nature under the power of sin—is in direct conflict with the Spirit (verse 17).
When the flesh is in charge, the results are obvious (verses 19–21).
But when the Spirit is in control, He produces godly qualities within us, apart from the strictures of the Law (verses 22–23).
Believers “have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires” (verse 24), and now we walk in the Spirit (verse 25).
Those who walk in the Spirit are united with Him and the bearers of the fruit the Spirit produces.
Thus, those who walk in the Spirit walk in love—they live in love for God and for their fellow man.
Those who walk in the Spirit walk in joy—they exhibit gladness in what God has done, is doing, and will do.
Those who walk in the Spirit walk in peace—they live worry-free and refuse anxiety (Philippians 4:6).
Those who walk in the Spirit walk in patience—they are known for having a “long fuse” and do not lose their temper.
Those who walk in the Spirit walk in kindness—they show tender concern for the needs of others.
Those who walk in the Spirit walk in goodness—their actions reflect virtue and holiness.
Thus, those who walk in the Spirit walk in love—they live in love for God and for their fellow man.
Those who walk in the Spirit walk in self-control—they display moderation, constraint, and the ability to say “no” to the flesh.
Those who walk in the Spirit walk in self-control—they display moderation, constraint, and the ability to say “no” to the flesh.
Those who walk in the Spirit rely on the Holy Spirit to guide them in thought, word, and deed (Romans 6:11–14).
They show forth daily, moment-by-moment holiness, just as Jesus did when, “full of the Holy Spirit, [He] left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness” to be tempted (Luke 4:1).
To walk in the Spirit is to be filled with the Spirit, and some results of the Spirit’s filling are thankfulness, singing, and joy (Ephesians 5:18–20; Colossians 3:16).
Those who walk in the Spirit follow the Spirit’s lead.
They “let the word of Christ dwell in [them] richly” (Colossians 3:16, ESV), and the Spirit uses the Word of God “for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16).
Their whole way of life is lived according to the rule of the gospel, as the Spirit moves them toward obedience.
When we walk in the Spirit, we find that the sinful appetites of the flesh have no more dominion over us.

Exodus 21:22-25 prescribes the same penalty—death—for someone who causes the death of a baby in the womb as for someone who commits murder.
The first argument that always arises against the Christian stance on abortion is “What about cases of rape and/or incest?” As horrible as it would be to become pregnant as a result of rape and/or incest, is the murder of a baby the answer?
Third, even in the one-tenth of one-percent of abortions that are done to save the life of the mother, in the vast majority of these cases, an early induced delivery of the baby or a C-section is what is necessary, not an abortion.

At the same time, Christians can rest assured that being a soldier is highly respected throughout the Scriptures and know that such service is consistent with a biblical worldview.
The first example of military service is found in the Old Testament (Genesis 14), when Abraham’s nephew Lot was kidnapped by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and his allies.
Saul was the first to form a permanent army (1 Samuel 13:2; 24:2; 26:2).
Many centurions mentioned in the New Testament are praised as Christians, God-fearers, and men of good character (Matthew 8:5; 27:54; Mark 15:39-45; Luke 7:2; 23:47; Acts 10:1; 21:32; 28:16).

The Bible also uses military terms to describe being strong in the Lord by putting on the whole armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-20), including the tools of the soldier—helmet, shield, and sword.

 Angels are personal spiritual beings who have intelligence, emotions, and will.
This is true of both the good and evil angels (demons).
Angels possess intelligence (Matthew 8:29; 2 Corinthians 11:3; 1 Peter 1:12), show emotion (Luke 2:13; James 2:19; Revelation 12:17), and exercise will (Luke 8:28-31; 2 Timothy 2:26; Jude 6).
Angels are spirit beings (Hebrews 1:14) without true physical bodies.
Although they do not have physical bodies, they are still personalities.
First, angels were created as an order of creatures higher than humans.
This means they do not know all things as God does (Matthew 24:36).
They do seem to have greater knowledge than humans, however, which may be due to three things.
First, angels were created as an order of creatures higher than humans.
Because they are created beings, their knowledge is limited.
Second, angels study the Bible and the world more thoroughly than humans do and gain knowledge from it (James 2:19; Revelation 12:12).
Third, angels gain knowledge through long observation of human activities.
First, angels were created as an order of creatures higher than humans.
Therefore, they know how others have acted and reacted in situations and can predict with a greater degree of accuracy how we may act in similar circumstances.
First, angels were created as an order of creatures higher than humans.
Good angels are sent by God to help believers (Hebrews 1:14).
 They praise God (Psalm 148:1-2; Isaiah 6:3).
 They praise God (Psalm 148:1-2; Isaiah 6:3).
They rejoice in what God does (Job 38:6-7).
They serve God (Psalm 103:20; Revelation 22:9).
They appear before God (Job 1:6; 2:1).
They are instruments of God’s judgments (Revelation 7:1; 8:2).
They bring answers to prayer (Acts 12:5-10).
They aid in winning people to Christ (Acts 8:26; 10:3).
They observe Christian order, work, and suffering (1 Corinthians 4:9; 11:10; Ephesians 3:10; 1 Peter 1:12).
They encourage in times of danger (Acts 27:23-24).
They care for the righteous at the time of death (Luke 16:22).
Angels are an entirely different order of being than humans.
The Bible nowhere states that angels are created in the image and likeness of God, as humans are (Genesis 1:26).
Angels will never become, and never were, human beings.
God created the angels, just as He created humanity.
The Bible nowhere states that angels are created in the image and likeness of God, as humans are (Genesis 1:26).
Angels are spiritual beings that can, to a certain degree, take on physical form.
Humans are primarily physical beings, but with a spiritual aspect.
The greatest thing we can learn from the holy angels is their instant, unquestioning obedience to God’s commands.

The Bible has a great deal to say about the way we can successfully raise our children to be men and women of God.
Along with loving God and being a godly example by committing ourselves to His commands, we need to heed the command of Deuteronomy 6:7-9 regarding teaching our children to do the same.
The husband’s responsibility as the head of the household is to love his wife as he loves his own body, in the same sacrificial way that Christ loved the church (Ephesians 5:25-29).
The husband’s responsibility as the head of the household is to love his wife as he loves his own body, in the same sacrificial way that Christ loved the church (Ephesians 5:25-29).
In response to this loving leadership, it is not difficult for the wife to submit to her husband’s authority (Ephesians 5:24; Colossians 3:18).
Proverbs 13:24 says, “He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him.” Children who grow up in undisciplined households feel unwanted and unworthy.
Proverbs 13:24 says, “He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him.” Children who grow up in undisciplined households feel unwanted and unworthy.
God recognizes that discipline is painful when it is happening (Hebrews 12:11), but if followed by loving instruction, it is remarkably beneficial to the child.
In response to this loving leadership, it is not difficult for the wife to submit to her husband’s authority (Ephesians 5:24; Colossians 3:18).

Genesis 38:10 says, “What he did was wicked in the LORD’s sight; so He put him to death also.” Onan’s motivation was selfish; he used Tamar for his own pleasure, but refused to perform his legal duty of creating an heir for his deceased brother.
God sometimes blesses barren women with children (Psalm 113:9; Genesis 21:1-3; 25:21-22; 30:1-2; 1 Samuel 1:6-8; Luke 1:7, 24-25).

Also, those who use oral or hormonal contraceptives (the Pill) or an IUD should be aware that both those methods of birth control can prevent the implantation of a fertilized ovum; in other words, low-dose oral contraceptives and IUDs can be abortifacients.
The inability to have children when they are desired is always presented in Scripture as a bad thing, especially considering the cultural stigma attached to childlessness at that time.
                                                                                         Answer
Tamar was given in marriage to Er’s brother, Onan, in accordance with the law of levirate marriage in Deuteronomy 25:5-6.

 The greatest commandment in Scripture is this: “Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength” (Deuteronomy 6:5).
Going back to verse 2, we read, “So that you, your children and their children after them may fear the LORD your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life.” Following Deuteronomy 6:5, we read, “These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts.

Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up” (vv.
6-7).
This brings us to Proverbs 22:6, “Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.” To “train” indicates the first instruction that a father and mother give to a child, i.e., his early education.

The positive part of Ephesians 6:4 is expressed in a comprehensive direction—educate them, bring them up, develop their conduct in all of life by the instruction and admonition of the Lord.
The word “provoke” means “to irritate, exasperate, rub the wrong way, or incite.” This is done by a wrong spirit and wrong methods—severity, unreasonableness, sternness, harshness, cruel demands, needless restrictions, and selfish insistence upon dictatorial authority.
The positive part of Ephesians 6:4 is expressed in a comprehensive direction—educate them, bring them up, develop their conduct in all of life by the instruction and admonition of the Lord.
The whole process of instruction and discipline must be that which God commands and which He administers, so that His authority should be brought into constant and immediate contact with the mind, heart, and conscience of children.
Chastening, discipline, and counsel by the Word of God, giving both reproof and encouragement, is at the core of “admonition.” The instruction proceeds from the Lord, is learned in the school of Christian experience, and is administered by the parents—primarily the father, but also, under his direction, the mother.
“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
As the father is faithful in role modeling, what children learn about God will put them in good standing throughout their earthly lives, no matter what they do or where they go.
                                                                                         Answer
Christian discipline is needed to enable children to grow up with reverence for God, respect for parental authority, knowledge of Christian standards, and habits of self-control.

A Christian mother is told to love her children (Titus 2:4-5), in part so that she does not bring reproach on the Lord and on the Savior whose name she bears.
This word represents a special kind of “mother love.” The idea that flows out of this word is that of caring for our children, nurturing them, affectionately embracing them, meeting their needs, and tenderly befriending each one as a unique gift from the hand of God.
Several things are commanded of Christian mothers in God’s Word:
 Availability – morning, noon, and night (Deuteronomy 6:6-7)
 Involvement – interacting, discussing, thinking, and processing life together (Ephesians 6:4)
 Teaching – the Scriptures and a biblical worldview (Psalm 78:5-6; Deuteronomy 4:10; Ephesians 6:4)
 Training – helping a child to develop skills and discover his/her strengths (Proverbs 22:6) and spiritual gifts (Romans 12:3-8 and 1 Corinthians 12)
 Discipline – teaching the fear of the Lord, drawing the line consistently, lovingly, firmly (Ephesians 6:4; Hebrews 12:5-11; Proverbs 13:24; 19:18; 22:15; 23:13-14; 29:15-17)
 Nurture – providing an environment of constant verbal support, freedom to fail, acceptance, affection, unconditional love (Titus 2:4; 2 Timothy 1:7; Ephesians 4:29-32; 5:1-2; Galatians 5:22; 1 Peter 3:8-9)
 Training – helping a child to develop skills and discover his/her strengths (Proverbs 22:6) and spiritual gifts (Romans 12:3-8 and 1 Corinthians 12)

Just as a mother bears a child during pregnancy, and just as a mother feeds and cares for a child during infancy, so mothers also play an ongoing role in the lives of their children, whether they are adolescents, teenagers, young adults, or even adults with children of their own.

In Titus 2:4, the Greek word philoteknos appears in reference to mothers loving their children.

At the same time, many Christians refuse to submit to the biblical exhortations about making offerings to the Lord.
The tithe was a requirement of the Law in which the Israelites were to give 10 percent of the crops they grew and the livestock they raised to the tabernacle/temple (Leviticus 27:30; Numbers 18:26; Deuteronomy 14:24; 2 Chronicles 31:5).
The New Testament nowhere designates a percentage of income a person should set aside, but only says gifts should be “in keeping with income” (1 Corinthians 16:2).

Romans 1:25 declares, “They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised.
Strictly speaking, evolution cannot be observed or tested any more or less than intelligent design, but that does not seem to be an issue with non-believing evolutionists.
Others take a deistic view of God, believing He exists but is not involved in the world, and everything proceeds along an uninterrupted, natural course.
Although belief in some form of evolution predates Charles Darwin, he was the first to develop a plausible, natural source for the process of evolution: natural selection.
Darwin once identified himself as a Christian, but, as a result of some tragedies that took place in his life, he later renounced the Christian faith and the existence of God.
    
Proverbs 1:7 tells us, “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.”
According to the Bible, anyone who denies the existence of God is a fool.

In order for something to be considered a “science,” they argue, it must be “naturalistic.” Creation, by definition, is beyond the rules of the natural world.
Evolution gives atheists a basis for explaining how life developed apart from a Creator God.

As such, modern theories of evolution serve as a substitute “creation story” for the religion of atheism.

 Although the words “courtship” and “dating” are not found in the Bible, we are given some principles that Christians are to go by during the time before marriage.
The first is that we must separate from the world’s view on dating because God’s way contradicts the world’s (2 Peter 2:20).
While the world’s view may be to date around as much as we want, the important thing is to discover the character of a person before making any commitment to him or her.
We should find out if the person has been born again in the Spirit of Christ (John 3:3-8) and if he or she shares the same desire toward Christ-likeness (Philippians 2:5).
The ultimate goal of dating or courting is finding a life partner.
The Bible tells us that, as Christians, we should not marry an unbeliever (2 Corinthians 6:14-15) because this would weaken our relationship with Christ and compromise our morals and standards.
When one is in a committed relationship, whether dating or courting, it is important to remember to love the Lord above all else (Matthew 10:37).
To say or believe that another person is “everything” or the most important thing in one’s life is idolatry, which is sin (Galatians 5:20; Colossians 3:5).
Also, we are not to defile our bodies by having premarital sex (1 Corinthians 6:9, 13; 2 Timothy 2:22).
Sexual immorality is a sin not only against God but against our own bodies (1 Corinthians 6:18).
It is important to love and honor others as we love ourselves (Romans 12:9-10), and this is certainly true for a courtship or dating relationship.
Whether dating or courting, following these biblical principles is the best way to have a secure foundation for a marriage.
It is one of the most important decisions we will ever make, because when two people marry, they cleave to one another and become one flesh in a relationship which God intended to be permanent and unbreakable (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5).

 Demons are fallen angels, as Revelation 12:9 indicates: “The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray.
He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.” Satan’s fall from heaven is symbolically described in Isaiah 14:12–15 and Ezekiel 28:12–15.
 Demons are fallen angels, as Revelation 12:9 indicates: “The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray.
Jude 6  also mentions angels who sinned.
 Demons are fallen angels, as Revelation 12:9 indicates: “The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray.
Satan and his demons now look to destroy the work of God and deceive anyone they can (1 Peter 5:8; 2 Corinthians 11:14–15).
The demons are described as evil spirits (Matthew 10:1), unclean spirits (Mark 1:27), lying spirits (1 Kings 22:23), and angels of Satan (Revelation 12:9).
Satan and his demons deceive the world (2 Corinthians 4:4), promulgate false doctrine (1 Timothy 4:1), attack Christians (2 Corinthians 12:7; 1 Peter 5:8), and combat the holy angels (Revelation 12:4–9).
The demons are described as evil spirits (Matthew 10:1), unclean spirits (Mark 1:27), lying spirits (1 Kings 22:23), and angels of Satan (Revelation 12:9).
The demons/fallen angels are enemies of God, but they are defeated enemies.

Depression is often triggered by life circumstances, such as a loss of job, death of a loved one, divorce, or psychological problems such as abuse or low self-esteem.
The Bible tells us to be filled with joy and praise (Philippians 4:4; Romans 15:11), so God apparently intends for us all to live joyful lives.
This is not easy for someone suffering from situational depression, but it can be remedied through God’s gifts of prayer, Bible study and application, support groups, fellowship among believers, confession, forgiveness, and counseling.
The Bible tells us that God will never allow temptations into our lives that are too much for us to handle (1 Corinthians 10:13).

 The topic of dinosaurs in the Bible is part of a larger ongoing debate within the Christian community over the age of the earth, the proper interpretation of Genesis, and how to interpret the physical evidences we find all around us.
Those who believe in a younger age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does mention dinosaurs, though it never actually uses the word “dinosaur.” Instead, it uses the Hebrew word tanniyn, which is translated a few different ways in our English Bibles.
Rock carvings in South America depict men riding diplodocus-like creatures and, amazingly, bear the familiar images of triceratops-like, pterodactyl-like, and tyrannosaurus rex-like creatures.
Rock carvings in South America depict men riding diplodocus-like creatures and, amazingly, bear the familiar images of triceratops-like, pterodactyl-like, and tyrannosaurus rex-like creatures.
While the Bible does not discuss the issue, dinosaurs likely died out sometime after the flood due to a combination of dramatic environmental shifts and the fact that they were relentlessly hunted to extinction by man.

 First of all, no matter what view one takes on the issue of divorce, it is important to remember Malachi 2:16: “I hate divorce, says the LORD God of Israel.” According to the Bible, marriage is a lifetime commitment.
Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate” (Matthew 19:6).
Jesus pointed out that these laws were given because of the hardness of people’s hearts, not because such laws were God’s desire (Matthew 19:8).
The controversy over whether divorce and remarriage is allowed according to the Bible revolves primarily around Jesus’ words in Matthew 5:32 and 19:9.
However, the Greek word translated “marital unfaithfulness” is a word which can mean any form of sexual immorality.
Sexual relations are an integral part of the marital bond: “the two will become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5; Ephesians 5:31).
Some understand 1 Corinthians 7:15 as another “exception,” allowing remarriage if an unbelieving spouse divorces a believer.
The Bible makes it abundantly clear that God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16) and that reconciliation and forgiveness should mark a believer’s life (Luke 11:4; Ephesians 4:32).

 Scripture has much to say regarding the drinking of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3; Deuteronomy 29:6; Judges 13:4, 7, 14; Proverbs 20:1; 31:4; Isaiah 5:11, 22; 24:9; 28:7; 29:9; 56:12).
 Scripture has much to say regarding the drinking of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3; Deuteronomy 29:6; Judges 13:4, 7, 14; Proverbs 20:1; 31:4; Isaiah 5:11, 22; 24:9; 28:7; 29:9; 56:12).

However, due to the biblical concerns regarding alcohol and its effects, due to the easy temptation to consume alcohol in excess, and due to the possibility of causing offense and/or stumbling of others, it is often best for a Christian to abstain from drinking alcohol.
                                                                                         Answer

 Paul’s charge to us in Romans 13:8 to owe nothing but love is a powerful reminder of God’s distaste for all forms of debt that are not being paid in a timely manner (see also Psalm 37:21).
 Paul’s charge to us in Romans 13:8 to owe nothing but love is a powerful reminder of God’s distaste for all forms of debt that are not being paid in a timely manner (see also Psalm 37:21).
Just as God had mercifully brought the Israelites out of Egypt when they were nothing but penniless slaves and had given them a land of their own (Leviticus 25:38), so He expected them to express similar kindness to their own poor citizens.
 Paul’s charge to us in Romans 13:8 to owe nothing but love is a powerful reminder of God’s distaste for all forms of debt that are not being paid in a timely manner (see also Psalm 37:21).
At the same time, in some situations going into debt is a “necessary evil.” As long as money is being handled wisely and the debt payments are manageable, a Christian can take on the burden of financial debt if it is absolutely necessary.
                                                                                         Answer
The Bible has harsh words of condemnation for lenders who abuse those who are bound to them in debt, but it does not condemn the debtor.

 Isaiah 53:5, which is then quoted in 1 Peter 2:24, is a key verse on healing, but it is often misunderstood and misapplied.
“But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.” The word translated “healed” can mean either spiritual or physical healing.
Therefore, being “healed” in both these verses is speaking of being forgiven and saved, not physically healed.
Sometimes people are physically healed when they place their faith in Christ, but this is not always the case.
And if we know that He hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of Him” (1 John 5:14-15).
Unless the Lord returns, everyone who is alive today will die, and the vast majority of them (Christians included) will die as the result of a physical problem (disease, sickness, injury).
We all need to be less preoccupied with our physical condition in this world and a lot more concerned with our spiritual condition (Romans 12:1-2).
Therefore, being “healed” in both these verses is speaking of being forgiven and saved, not physically healed.
                                                                                         Answer

On the other hand, the Bible clearly and consistently declares that homosexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19:1–13; Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:10).
On the other hand, the Bible clearly and consistently declares that homosexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19:1–13; Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:10).
God promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).

He gives these concluding remarks in the book of Ecclesiastes: "Here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.
Solomon says that life is all about honoring God with our thoughts and lives and thus keeping His commandments, for one day we will stand before Him in judgment.
In Psalm 73, Asaph talks about how he was tempted to envy the wicked who seemed to have no cares and built their fortunes upon the backs of those they took advantage of, but then he considered their ultimate end.
Paul’s purpose was knowing Christ, having a righteousness obtained through faith in Him, and living in fellowship with Him, even when that brought on suffering (2 Timothy 3:12).
In Psalm 73, Asaph talks about how he was tempted to envy the wicked who seemed to have no cares and built their fortunes upon the backs of those they took advantage of, but then he considered their ultimate end.
In Philippians 3:9-10, Paul says that he wants nothing more than to know Christ and “be found in Him,” to have His righteousness and to live by faith in Him, even if it meant suffering and dying.
Our purpose in life, as God originally created man, is 1) glorify God and enjoy fellowship with Him, 2) have good relationships with others, 3) work, and 4) have dominion over the earth.
We enjoy God by following His purpose for our lives, which enables us to experience true and lasting joy—the abundant life that He desires for us.

An interracial couple may face discrimination and ridicule, and they should be prepared to respond to such prejudice in a biblical manner.
                                                                                         Answer
A colorblind church and/or a Christian interracial marriage can be a powerful illustration of our equality in Christ.

If the biblical pattern for reconciliation has been followed (Matthew 18:15-17) and the offending party is still in the wrong, in some instances a lawsuit might be justified.
The whole context of 1 Corinthians 6:1-6 deals with disputes in the church, but Paul does reference the court system when he speaks of judgments concerning things pertaining to this life.
The Romans arrested him and “the commander brought Paul inside and ordered him lashed with whips to make him confess his crime.
As they tied Paul down to lash him, Paul said to the officer standing there, ‘Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn’t even been tried?’” Paul used the Roman law and his citizenship to protect himself.
Paul further declares, “Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another.
As they tied Paul down to lash him, Paul said to the officer standing there, ‘Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn’t even been tried?’” Paul used the Roman law and his citizenship to protect himself.
However, in some instances, such as the protection of our own rights (as in the example of the apostle Paul), it may be appropriate to pursue a legal solution.

See Proverbs 6:1-5; 20:16; 22:7, 26-27 (“The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.... Do not be a man who strikes hands in pledge or puts up security for debts; if you lack the means to pay, your very bed will be snatched from under you”).
The moral of the story is “So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?” (v. 11).
Proverbs 28:20: “A faithful man will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished.” See also Proverbs 10:15; 11:4; 18:11; 23:5.

“Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:6-7).
We are also responsible to provide for our own household, as 1 Timothy 5:8 reminds us: “If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.”
Rather than desiring to heap riches upon ourselves, the biblical model is one of giving, not getting.
We are to use our money to help others, but with discernment and the guidance of God’s Spirit.

Over and over again, the Bible warns against the accumulation of wealth and encourages us to seek spiritual riches instead.

 The Bible records the creation of marriage in Genesis 2:23–24: “The man said, ‘This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called “woman,” for she was taken out of man.’ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.” God created man and then made woman to complement him.

In the Bible marriage is God’s “fix” for the fact that “it is not good for the man to be alone” (Genesis 2:18).
As the Bible describes the first marriage, it uses the word helper to identify Eve (Genesis 2:20).
To “help” in this context means “to surround, to protect or aid.” God created Eve to come alongside Adam as his "other half," to be his aid and his helper.
The Bible says that marriage causes a man and woman to become “one flesh.” This oneness is manifested most fully in the physical union of sexual intimacy.
Several of Paul’s epistles refer to marriage and how believers are to operate within the marriage relationship.
Studying this passage provides some key truths concerning what the Bible says marriage should be.
One such passage is Ephesians 5:22–33.
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior” (Ephesians 5:22–23).
The Bible, in Ephesians 5, says a successful biblical marriage involves both the husband and the wife fulfilling certain roles: “Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior” (Ephesians 5:22–23).
“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her” (Ephesians 5:25).
“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her” (Ephesians 5:25).
“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh” (Ephesians 5:31).
“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh” (Ephesians 5:31).

 What constitutes marriage according to the Bible?

 By far, the most searched for terms on the internet are related to pornography.
Pornography definitely causes us to lust after flesh, and it is undeniably a lust of the eyes.
Perhaps more than anything else, Satan has succeeded in twisting and perverting sex.
He has taken what is good and right (loving sex between a husband and wife) and replaced it with lust, pornography, adultery, rape, and homosexuality.
Pornography can be the first step on a very slippery slope of ever-increasing wickedness and immorality (Romans 6:19).
The addictive nature of pornography is well documented.
Just as a drug user must consume greater quantities of drugs or more powerful drugs to achieve the same “high,” pornography drags a person deeper and deeper into hard-core sexual addictions and ungodly desires.
The three main categories of sin are the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (1 John 2:16).
When habitual devotion to pornography characterizes a person’s life and he/she continues in sin without seeking help, making no attempt to stop or feeling no desire to change his/her behavior, it demonstrates the person may not be saved (1 Corinthians 6:9-12).
Pornography definitely does not qualify as one of the things we are to think about, according to Philippians 4:8.
Pornography is addictive (1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19) and destructive (Proverbs 6:25-28; Ezekiel 20:30; Ephesians 4:19).
Lusting after other people in our minds, which is the essence of pornography, is offensive to God (Matthew 5:28).
When habitual devotion to pornography characterizes a person’s life and he/she continues in sin without seeking help, making no attempt to stop or feeling no desire to change his/her behavior, it demonstrates the person may not be saved (1 Corinthians 6:9-12).
For those involved in pornography, God can and will give the victory.
When habitual devotion to pornography characterizes a person’s life and he/she continues in sin without seeking help, making no attempt to stop or feeling no desire to change his/her behavior, it demonstrates the person may not be saved (1 Corinthians 6:9-12).
3) Ask God to fill your mind with things that are true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, and commendable (Philippians 4:8).
4) Learn to possess your body in holiness (1 Thessalonians 4:3-4).
5) Understand the proper meaning of sex and rely on your spouse alone to meet that need (1 Corinthians 7:1-5).
4) Learn to possess your body in holiness (1 Thessalonians 4:3-4).
7) Take practical steps to reduce your exposure to graphic images.
Install pornography blockers on your computer, limit television and video usage, and find another Christian who will pray for you and help keep you accountable.

 The first thing to understand in this discussion is that there is only one race—the human race.
Caucasians, Africans, Asians, Indians, Arabs, and Jews are not different races.
Rather, they are different ethnicities of the human race.
All human beings have the same physical characteristics (with minor variations, of course).
More importantly, all human beings are equally created in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27).
God loved the world so much that He sent Jesus to lay down His life for us (John 3:16).
The “world” obviously includes all ethnic groups.
God does not show partiality or favoritism (Deuteronomy 10:17; Acts 10:34; Romans 2:11; Ephesians 6:9), and neither should we.
James 2:4 describes those who discriminate as “judges with evil thoughts.” Instead, we are to love our neighbors as ourselves (James 2:8).
James 2:4 describes those who discriminate as “judges with evil thoughts.” Instead, we are to love our neighbors as ourselves (James 2:8).
In the Old Testament, God divided humanity into two “racial” groups: Jews and Gentiles.
God’s intent was for the Jews to be a kingdom of priests, ministering to the Gentile nations.
Instead, for the most part, the Jews became proud of their status and despised the Gentiles.
Jesus Christ put an end to this, destroying the dividing wall of hostility (Ephesians 2:14).
All forms of racism, prejudice, and discrimination are affronts to the work of Christ on the cross.
Jesus commands us to love one another as He loves us (John 13:34).
If God is impartial and loves us with impartiality, then we need to love others with that same high standard.
Jesus teaches in Matthew 25 that whatever we do to the least of His brothers, we do to Him.
If we treat a person with contempt, we are mistreating a person created in God’s image; we are hurting somebody whom God loves and for whom Jesus died.
Racism, in varying forms and to various degrees, has been a plague on humanity for thousands of years.
Brothers and sisters of all ethnicities, this should not be.
Victims of racism, prejudice, and discrimination need to forgive.
Ephesians 4:32 declares, “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.” Racists may not deserve your forgiveness, but we deserved God’s forgiveness far less.
Ephesians 4:32 declares, “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.” Racists may not deserve your forgiveness, but we deserved God’s forgiveness far less.
Those who practice racism, prejudice, and discrimination need to repent.

According to 1 Corinthians 7:2, “yes” is the clear answer: “But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.” In this verse, Paul states that marriage is the “cure” for sexual immorality.
First Corinthians 7:2 is essentially saying that, because people cannot control themselves and so many are having immoral sex outside of marriage, people should get married.
There are numerous Scriptures that declare sex before marriage to be a sin (Acts 15:20; 1 Corinthians 5:1; 6:13, 18; 10:8; 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Jude 7).
Since 1 Corinthians 7:2 clearly includes sex before marriage in the definition of sexual immorality, all of the Bible verses that condemn sexual immorality as being sinful also condemn sex before marriage as sinful.
While practicality does not determine right from wrong, if the Bible’s message on sex before marriage were obeyed, there would be far fewer sexually transmitted diseases, far fewer abortions, far fewer unwed mothers and unwanted pregnancies, and far fewer children growing up without both parents in their lives.
                                                                                         Answer
Sex before marriage is included in the biblical definition of sexual immorality.

The New Testament does not say anything about whether or not a believer in Jesus Christ should get a tattoo.
◦ Whatever does not come from faith is sin (Romans 14:23), so the person getting the tattoo should be fully convinced that it is God’s will for him or her.
Because of Scripture’s silence, getting inked falls under the category of a “gray area,” and believers should follow their convictions in the matter, respecting those who may have different convictions.

 The Old Testament law commanded the death penalty for various acts: murder (Exodus 21:12), kidnapping (Exodus 21:16), bestiality (Exodus 22:19), adultery (Leviticus 20:10), homosexuality (Leviticus 20:13), being a false prophet (Deuteronomy 13:5), prostitution and rape (Deuteronomy 22:24), and several other crimes.
When the Pharisees brought a woman who was caught in the act of adultery to Jesus and asked Him if she should be stoned, Jesus replied, “If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her” (John 8:7).
The Pharisees wanted to trick Jesus into breaking the Old Testament law; they did not truly care about the woman being stoned (where was the man who was caught in adultery?)
The apostle Paul definitely recognized the power of the government to institute capital punishment where appropriate (Romans 13:1-7).
 The Old Testament law commanded the death penalty for various acts: murder (Exodus 21:12), kidnapping (Exodus 21:16), bestiality (Exodus 22:19), adultery (Leviticus 20:10), homosexuality (Leviticus 20:13), being a false prophet (Deuteronomy 13:5), prostitution and rape (Deuteronomy 22:24), and several other crimes.

Jesus was simply exposing the hypocrisy of the Pharisees.

 In the prosperity gospel, also known as the “Word of Faith Movement,” the believer is told to use God, whereas the truth of biblical Christianity is just the opposite—God uses the believer.
Paul said covetousness is idolatry (Ephesians 5:5) and instructed the Ephesians to avoid anyone who brought a message of immorality or covetousness (Ephesians 5:6-7).
In sharp contrast to the prosperity gospel emphasis on gaining money and possessions in this life, Jesus said, “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal” (Matthew 6:19).
Faith, according to the Word of Faith doctrine, is not submissive trust in God; faith is a formula by which we manipulate the spiritual laws that prosperity teachers believe govern the universe.
The irreconcilable contradictions between prosperity teaching and the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is best summed up in the words of Jesus in Matthew 6:24, “You cannot serve both God and money.”
You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.” Far from speaking things into existence in the future, we do not even know what tomorrow will bring or even whether we will be alive.

However, the Hebrew word literally means “the intentional, premeditated killing of another person with malice; murder.” God often ordered the Israelites to go to war with other nations (1 Samuel 15:3; Joshua 4:13).
In the Old Testament, God ordered the Israelites to “take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites” (Numbers 31:2).
Completely destroy them…as the LORD your God has commanded you.” Also, 1 Samuel 15:18 says, “Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; make war on them until you have wiped them out.” Obviously God is not against all war.
Jesus is always in perfect agreement with the Father (John 10:30), so we cannot argue that war was only God’s will in the Old Testament.
Revelation 19:11-21 describes the ultimate war with Christ, the conquering commander who judges and makes war “with justice” (v. 11).
Revelation 19:11-21 describes the ultimate war with Christ, the conquering commander who judges and makes war “with justice” (v. 11).
If Hitler had not been defeated by World War II, how many more millions would have been killed?
At the same time, Ecclesiastes 3:8 declares, “There is…a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.” In a world filled with sin, hatred, and evil (Romans 3:10-18), war is inevitable.
Christians should not desire war, but neither are Christians to oppose the government God has placed in authority over them (Romans 13:1-4; 1 Peter 2:17).

There are women who believe women should not serve as pastors and that the Bible places restrictions on the ministry of women, and there are men who believe women can serve as pastors and that there are no restrictions on women in ministry.
This precludes women from serving as pastors over men, which definitely includes preaching to them, teaching them publicly, and exercising spiritual authority over them.
The fact that Eve was deceived is also given in 1 Timothy 2:14 as a reason for women not serving as pastors or having spiritual authority over men.
A second common objection is that Paul only restricted the women of Ephesus from teaching men (1 Timothy was written to Timothy, the pastor of the church in Ephesus).
Women, just as much as men, are called to minister to others, to demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23), and to proclaim the gospel to the lost (Matthew 28:18–20; Acts 1:8; 1 Peter 3:15).
The New Testament Epistles present a new paradigm for God’s people—the church, the body of Christ—and that paradigm involves an authority structure unique to the church, not for the nation of Israel or any other Old Testament entity.
Women, just as much as men, are called to minister to others, to demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23), and to proclaim the gospel to the lost (Matthew 28:18–20; Acts 1:8; 1 Peter 3:15).
“Able to teach” is given as a qualification for elders, but not for deacons (1 Timothy 3:1–13; Titus 1:6–9).
Verse 13 begins with “for,” giving the “cause” of Paul’s statement in verses 11–12.
The fact that Eve was deceived is also given in 1 Timothy 2:14 as a reason for women not serving as pastors or having spiritual authority over men.

Yet another objection to this interpretation of women in pastoral ministry is in relation to women who held positions of leadership in the Bible, specifically Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah in the Old Testament.

The Bible teaches that the Father is God, that Jesus is God, and that the Holy Spirit is God.
Rather than attempting to fully define the Trinity with our finite human minds, we would be better served by focusing on the fact of God’s greatness and His infinitely higher nature.
 1) There is one God (Deuteronomy 6:4; 1 Corinthians 8:4; Galatians 3:20; 1 Timothy 2:5).
2) The Trinity consists of three Persons (Genesis 1:1, 26; 3:22; 11:7; Isaiah 6:8, 48:16, 61:1; Matthew 3:16-17, 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14).
The Holy Spirit is the means by whom the Father does the following works: creation and maintenance of the universe (Genesis 1:2; Job 26:13; Psalm 104:30); divine revelation (John 16:12-15; Ephesians 3:5; 2 Peter 1:21); salvation (John 3:6; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:2); and Jesus’ works (Isaiah 61:1; Acts 10:38).

The Father is the ultimate source or cause of the universe (1 Corinthians 8:6; Revelation 4:11); divine revelation (Revelation 1:1); salvation (John 3:16-17); and Jesus’ human works (John 5:17; 14:10).
The Son is the agent through whom the Father does the following works: the creation and maintenance of the universe (1 Corinthians 8:6; John 1:3; Colossians 1:16-17); divine revelation (John 1:1, 16:12-15; Matthew 11:27; Revelation 1:1); and salvation (2 Corinthians 5:19; Matthew 1:21; John 4:42).

The doctrine of the Trinity has been a divisive issue throughout the entire history of the Christian church.
                                                                                         Answer
It is foolish to debate the fairness of God sending someone to hell who never had the opportunity to hear the gospel of Christ.
 All people are accountable to God whether or not they have “heard about Him.” The Bible tells us that God has clearly revealed Himself in nature (Romans 1:20) and in the hearts of people (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
The problem is that the human race is sinful; we all reject this knowledge of God and rebel against Him (Romans 1:21-23).
If it were not for God’s grace, we would be given over to the sinful desires of our hearts, allowing us to discover how useless and miserable life is apart from Him.
He does this for those who continually reject Him (Romans 1:24-32).
In reality, it is not that some people have not heard about God.
Rather, the problem is that they have rejected what they have heard and what is readily seen in nature.
Deuteronomy 4:29 proclaims, “But if from there you seek the LORD your God, you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul.” This verse teaches an important principle—everyone who truly seeks after God will find Him.

If a person truly desires to know God, God will make Himself known.
The problem is “there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God” (Romans 3:11).
We know people reject the knowledge of God revealed in nature, and that must motivate us to proclaim the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ.
It is foolish to debate the fairness of God sending someone to hell who never had the opportunity to hear the gospel of Christ.
Only by accepting God’s grace through the Lord Jesus Christ can people be saved from their sins and rescued from an eternity apart from God.
The Bible says that people reject this knowledge, and therefore God is just in condemning them to hell.
Instead of debating the fate of those who have never heard, we, as Christians, should be doing our best to make sure they do hear.
We are called to spread the gospel throughout the nations (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8).
We know people reject the knowledge of God revealed in nature, and that must motivate us to proclaim the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ.
Only by accepting God’s grace through the Lord Jesus Christ can people be saved from their sins and rescued from an eternity apart from God.
If we assume that those who never hear the gospel are granted mercy from God, we lose our motivation for evangelism.
If people who never hear the gospel are automatically saved, then it is logical to make sure no one ever hears the gospel—because then there would be a chance they will reject it and be condemned.

 The Bible says that “Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral" (Hebrews 13:4).
Scripture never says what a husband and wife are or are not allowed to do sexually.
Husbands and wives are instructed, “Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time (1 Corinthians 7:5a).
This verse perhaps lays down the principle for sexual relations in marriage.
No one should be encouraged or coerced to do something he or she is uncomfortable with or thinks is wrong.
No one should be encouraged or coerced to do something he or she is uncomfortable with or thinks is wrong.
If a husband and wife both agree that they want to try something (e.g., oral sex, different positions, sex toys, etc.
There are a few things, though, that are never allowable sexually for a married couple.
is blatant adultery (Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3).
Adultery is sin even if your spouse allows, approves, or even participates in it.
Pornography appeals to the “lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes” (1 John 2:16) and is therefore condemned by God as well.
A husband and wife should never bring pornography into their sexual union.
Other than these two items, there is nothing that Scripture explicitly forbids a husband and wife to do with each other as long as it is by mutual consent.

 A dictionary definition of a Christian would be something similar to “a person professing belief in Jesus as the Christ or in the religion based on the teachings of Jesus.” While this is a good starting point, like many dictionary definitions, it falls somewhat short of really communicating the biblical truth of what it means to be a Christian.
The word “Christian” is used three times in the New Testament (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Peter 4:16).
Followers of Jesus Christ were first called “Christians” in Antioch (Acts 11:26) because their behavior, activity, and speech were like Christ.
The word “Christian” literally means, “belonging to the party of Christ” or a “follower of Christ.”
  Unfortunately over time, the word “Christian” has lost a great deal of its significance and is often used of someone who is religious or has high moral values but who may or may not be a true follower of Jesus Christ.
Many people who do not believe and trust in Jesus Christ consider themselves Christians simply because they go to church or they live in a “Christian” nation.
But going to church, serving those less fortunate than you, or being a good person does not make you a Christian.
Going to church does not make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile.
Being a member of a church, attending services regularly, and giving to the work of the church does not make you a Christian.
The Bible teaches that the good works we do cannot make us acceptable to God.
Titus 3:5 says, “He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.
He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.” So, a Christian is someone who has been born again by God (John 3:3; John 3:7; 1 Peter 1:23) and has put faith and trust in Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 2:8 tells us that it is “…by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.” 
 A true Christian is a person who has put faith and trust in the person and work of Jesus Christ, including His death on the cross as payment for sins and His resurrection on the third day.
John 1:12 tells us, “Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” The mark of a true Christian is love for others and obedience to God’s Word (1 John 2:4, 10).
A true Christian is indeed a child of God, a part of God’s true family, and one who has been given new life in Jesus Christ.

 A “worldview” refers to a comprehensive conception of the world from a specific standpoint.
A “Christian worldview,” then, is a comprehensive conception of the world from a Christian standpoint.
An individual’s worldview is his “big picture,” a harmony of all his beliefs about the world.
It is his way of understanding reality.
One’s worldview is the basis for making daily decisions and is therefore extremely important.
An apple sitting on a table is seen by several people.
A botanist looking at the apple classifies it.
An artist sees a still-life and draws it.
A grocer sees an asset and inventories it.
A child sees lunch and eats it.
How we look at any situation is influenced by how we look at the world at large.
Every worldview, Christian and non-Christian, deals with at least these three questions:
እንዴት እናጸናዋለን?
A prevalent worldview today is naturalism, which answers the three questions like this: 1) We are the product of random acts of nature with no real purpose.
2) We do not respect nature as we should.
3) We can save the world through ecology and conservation.
A naturalistic worldview generates many related philosophies such as moral relativism, existentialism, pragmatism, and utopianism.
A Christian worldview, on the other hand, answers the three questions biblically: 1) We are God’s creation, designed to govern the world and fellowship with Him (Genesis 1:27-28; 2:15).
2) We sinned against God and subjected the whole world to a curse (Genesis 3).
3) God Himself has redeemed the world through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ (Genesis 3:15; Luke 19:10), and will one day restore creation to its former perfect state (Isaiah 65:17-25).
A Christian worldview leads us to believe in moral absolutes, miracles, human dignity, and the possibility of redemption.
3) God Himself has redeemed the world through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ (Genesis 3:15; Luke 19:10), and will one day restore creation to its former perfect state (Isaiah 65:17-25).
It affects every area of life, from money to morality, from politics to art.
True Christianity is more than a set of ideas to use at church.
3) God Himself has redeemed the world through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ (Genesis 3:15; Luke 19:10), and will one day restore creation to its former perfect state (Isaiah 65:17-25).
The Bible never distinguishes between a “religious” and a “secular” life; the Christian life is the only life there is.
Jesus proclaimed Himself “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6) and, in doing so, became our worldview.

Agnosticism argues that God’s existence cannot be proven or unproven—that it is impossible to know whether or not God exists.
Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith “it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.” God is spirit (John 4:24) so He cannot be seen or touched.
The Bible declares that the existence of God can be clearly seen in the universe (Psalm 19:1-4), sensed in nature (Romans 1:18-22), and confirmed in our own hearts (Ecclesiastes 3:11).

Often, people doubt God’s existence because they do not understand or agree with the things He does and allows.
Romans 11:33-34 exclaims, “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

 Ephesians 5:3 tells us, “But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity...because these are improper for God’s holy people.” Anything that even “hints” of sexual immorality is inappropriate for a Christian.

Logically then, foreplay should be restricted to married couples.
Anything that can be considered foreplay should be avoided until marriage.
If there is any doubt whatsoever whether an activity is right for an unmarried couple, it should be avoided (Romans 14:23).
Any and all sexual and pre-sexual activity should be restricted to married couples.
An unmarried couple should avoid any activity that tempts them toward sex, that gives the appearance of immorality, or that could be considered foreplay.
Many pastors and Christian counselors strongly advise a couple to not go beyond holding hands, hugging, and light kissing before marriage.
The more a married couple has to share exclusively between themselves, the more special and unique the sexual relationship in that marriage becomes.

Inside the Atheist Mind by Anthony DeStefano
                                                                                         Answer
 The core beliefs of Christianity are summarized in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.
Jesus died for our sins, was buried, was resurrected, and thereby offers salvation to all who will receive Him in faith.
Unique among all other faiths, Christianity is more about a relationship than religious practices.
Instead of adhering to a list of “do’s and don’ts,” the goal of a Christian is to cultivate a close walk with God.
That relationship is made possible because of the work of Jesus Christ and the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
Beyond these core beliefs, there are many other items that are, or at least should be, indicative of what Christianity is and what Christians believe.
Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired, “God-breathed” Word of God and that its teaching is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
Christians believe in one God that exists in three persons—the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.
Christians believe that mankind was created specifically to have a relationship with God, but sin separates all men from God (Romans 3:23; 5:12).
Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ walked this earth, fully God, and yet fully man (Philippians 2:6-11), and died on the cross.
Christians believe that after His death, Christ was buried, He rose again, and now lives at the right hand of the Father, making intercession for the believers forever (Hebrews 7:25).
Christianity proclaims that Jesus’ death on the cross was sufficient to completely pay the sin debt owed by all men and this is what restores the broken relationship between God and man (Hebrews 9:11-14; 10:10; Romans 5:8; 6:23).
Christianity teaches that in order to be saved and be granted entrance into heaven after death, one must place one’s faith entirely in the finished work of Christ on the cross.
If we believe that Christ died in our place and paid the price of our own sins, and rose again, then we are saved.
There is nothing that anyone can do to earn salvation.
We cannot be “good enough” to please God on our own, because we are all sinners (Isaiah 53:6; 64:6-7).
There is nothing more to be done, because Christ has done all the work!
When He was on the cross, Jesus said, “It is finished” (John 19:30), meaning that the work of redemption was completed.
According to Christianity, salvation is freedom from the old sin nature and freedom to pursue a right relationship with God.
Where we were once slaves to sin, we are now slaves to Christ (Romans 6:15-22).
As long as believers live on this earth in their sinful bodies, they will engage in a constant struggle with sin.
However, Christians can have victory in the struggle with sin by studying and applying God’s Word in their lives and being controlled by the Holy Spirit—that is, submitting to the Spirit’s leading in everyday circumstances.
So, while many religious systems require that a person do or not do certain things, Christianity is about believing that Christ died on the cross as payment for our own sins and rose again.
Our sin debt is paid and we can have fellowship with God.
We can have victory over our sin nature and walk in fellowship and obedience with God.
That is true biblical Christianity.

Dispensationalism has two primary distinctives: 1) a consistently literal interpretation of Scripture, especially Bible prophecy, and 2) a view of the uniqueness of Israel as separate from the Church in God’s program.

Dispensationalism has two primary distinctives: 1) a consistently literal interpretation of Scripture, especially Bible prophecy, and 2) a view of the uniqueness of Israel as separate from the Church in God’s program.
The literal interpretation gives each word the meaning it would commonly have in everyday usage.
Jesus’ birth, ministry, death, and resurrection all occurred exactly as the Old Testament predicted.
It is understood that even symbols and figurative sayings have literal meanings behind them.
There are at least two reasons why literalism is the best way to view Scripture.
First, philosophically, the purpose of language itself requires that we interpret words literally.
Language was given by God for the purpose of being able to communicate.
Dispensationalists hold to a literal interpretation of the Bible as the best hermeneutic.
Every prophecy about Jesus Christ in the Old Testament was fulfilled literally.
Jesus’ birth, ministry, death, and resurrection all occurred exactly as the Old Testament predicted.
There is no non-literal fulfillment of messianic prophecies in the New Testament.
Dispensationalists hold to a literal interpretation of the Bible as the best hermeneutic.
If a literal interpretation is not used in studying the Scriptures, there is no objective standard by which to understand the Bible.
Each person would be able to interpret the Bible as he saw fit.
Biblical interpretation would devolve into “what this passage says to me” instead of “the Bible says.” Sadly, this is already the case in much of what is called Bible study today.

Dispensational theology teaches that there are two distinct peoples of God: Israel and the Church.
Dispensationalists believe that salvation has always been by grace through faith alone—in God in the Old Testament and specifically in God the Son in the New Testament.
Dispensationalists hold that the Church has not replaced Israel in God’s program and that the Old Testament promises to Israel have not been transferred to the Church.
Dispensationalism teaches that the promises God made to Israel in the Old Testament (for land, many descendants, and blessings) will be ultimately fulfilled in the 1000-year period spoken of in Revelation 20.
Dispensationalists believe that, just as God is in this age focusing His attention on the Church, He will again in the future focus His attention on Israel (see Romans 9–11 and Daniel 9:24).
Dispensationalists understand the Bible to be organized into seven dispensations: Innocence (Genesis 1:1—3:7), Conscience (Genesis 3:8—8:22), Human Government (Genesis 9:1—11:32), Promise (Genesis 12:1—Exodus 19:25), Law (Exodus 20:1—Acts 2:4), Grace (Acts 2:4—Revelation 20:3), and the Millennial Kingdom (Revelation 20:4–6).
Again, these dispensations are not paths to salvation, but manners in which God relates to man.
Dispensationalism, as a system, results in a premillennial interpretation of Christ’s second coming and usually a pretribulational interpretation of the rapture.
To summarize, dispensationalism is a theological system that emphasizes the literal interpretation of Bible prophecy, recognizes a distinction between Israel and the Church, and organizes the Bible into different dispensations or administrations.

Nearly every book of the Bible contains prophecy regarding the end times.
Nearly every book of the Bible contains prophecy regarding the end times.
Taking all of these prophecies and organizing them can be difficult.
Following is a very brief summary of what the Bible declares will happen in the end times.
Christ will remove all born-again believers from the earth in an event known as the rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-54).
At the judgment seat of Christ, these believers will be rewarded for good works and faithful service during their time on earth or will lose rewards, but not eternal life, for lack of service and obedience (1 Corinthians 3:11-15; 2 Corinthians 5:10).
The Antichrist (the beast) will come into power and will sign a covenant with Israel for seven years (Daniel 9:27).
This seven-year period of time is known as the “tribulation.” During the tribulation, there will be terrible wars, famines, plagues, and natural disasters.
This seven-year period of time is known as the “tribulation.” During the tribulation, there will be terrible wars, famines, plagues, and natural disasters.
The Antichrist will commit “the abomination of desolation” and set up an image of himself to be worshiped in the Jerusalem temple (Daniel 9:27; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-10), which will have been rebuilt.
The tribulation will include the appearance of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the seven seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments.
About halfway through the seven years, the Antichrist will break the peace covenant with Israel and make war against it.
The Antichrist will commit “the abomination of desolation” and set up an image of himself to be worshiped in the Jerusalem temple (Daniel 9:27; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-10), which will have been rebuilt.
The second half of the tribulation is known as “the great tribulation” (Revelation 7:14) and “the time of Jacob’s trouble” (Jeremiah 30:7).
At the end of the seven-year tribulation, the Antichrist will launch a final attack on Jerusalem, culminating in the battle of Armageddon.
Jesus Christ will return, destroy the Antichrist and his armies, and cast them into the lake of fire (Revelation 19:11-21).
Christ will then bind Satan in the Abyss for 1,000 years and He will rule His earthly kingdom for this thousand-year period (Revelation 20:1-6).
At the end of the thousand years, Satan will be released, defeated again, and then cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:7-10) for eternity.
Christ then judges all unbelievers (Revelation 20:10-15) at the great white throne judgment, casting them all into the lake of fire.
Christ will then usher in a new heaven and new earth and the New Jerusalem—the eternal dwelling place of believers.
There will be no more sin, sorrow, or death (Revelation 21–22).

 As a background, please read our article on the gift of speaking in tongues.
There are four primary Scripture passages that are cited as evidence for praying in tongues: Romans 8:26; 1 Corinthians 14:4-17; Ephesians 6:18; and Jude verse 20.
Ephesians 6:18 and Jude 20 mention “praying in the Spirit.” However, tongues as a prayer language is not a likely interpretation of “praying in the Spirit.”
Ephesians 6:18 and Jude 20 mention “praying in the Spirit.” However, tongues as a prayer language is not a likely interpretation of “praying in the Spirit.”
We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.” Two key points make it highly unlikely that Romans 8:26 is referring to tongues as a prayer language.

Second, Romans 8:26 states that the “groans” of the Spirit “cannot be expressed.” The very essence of speaking in tongues is uttering words.

First Corinthians chapter 14 is primarily a comparison/contrast of the gift of speaking in tongues and the gift of prophecy.
That leaves us with 1 Corinthians 14:4-17 and verse 14 especially: “For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.” First Corinthians 14:14 distinctly mentions “praying in tongues.” What does this mean?

First, studying the context is immensely valuable.
First Corinthians chapter 14 is primarily a comparison/contrast of the gift of speaking in tongues and the gift of prophecy.
Verses 2-5 make it clear that Paul views prophecy as a gift superior to tongues.
At the same time, Paul exclaims the value of tongues and declares that he is glad that he speaks in tongues more than anyone (verse 18).
Acts chapter 2 describes the first occurrence of the gift of tongues.
On the day of Pentecost, the apostles spoke in tongues.
Acts chapter 2 makes it clear that the apostles were speaking in a human language (Acts 2:6-8).
The word translated “tongues” in both Acts chapter 2 and 1 Corinthians chapter 14 is glossa which means “language.” It is the word from which we get our modern English word “glossary.” Speaking in tongues was the ability to speak in a language the speaker does not know, in order to communicate the gospel to someone who does speak that language.

In the multicultural area of Corinth, it seems that the gift of tongues was especially valuable and prominent.
The Corinthian believers were able to better communicate the gospel and God’s Word as a result of the gift of tongues.
However, Paul made it abundantly clear that even in this usage of tongues, it was to be interpreted or “translated” (1 Corinthians 14:13, 27).
A Corinthian believer would speak in tongues, proclaiming God’s truth to someone who spoke that language, and then that believer, or another believer in the church, was to interpret what was spoken so that the entire assembly could understand what was said.
This alternate understanding can be summarized as follows: praying in tongues is a personal prayer language between a believer and God (1 Corinthians 13:1) that a believer uses to edify himself (1 Corinthians 14:4).
As a result, it seems that praying in tongues was offering a prayer to God.
This prayer would minister to someone who spoke that language, but would also need to be interpreted so that the entire body could be edified.
This interpretation does not agree with those who view praying in tongues as a prayer language.
This alternate understanding can be summarized as follows: praying in tongues is a personal prayer language between a believer and God (1 Corinthians 13:1) that a believer uses to edify himself (1 Corinthians 14:4).
This interpretation is unbiblical for the following reasons: 1) How could praying in tongues be a private prayer language if it is to be interpreted (1 Corinthians 14:13-17)?
How could tongues be a gift for self-edification if not every believer can possess it?
Some understand praying in tongues to be a “secret code language” that prevents Satan and his demons from understanding our prayers and thereby gaining an advantage over us.
This interpretation is unbiblical for the following reasons: 1) The New Testament consistently describes tongues as a human language, and Satan and his demons are well able to understand human languages.
2) The Bible records countless believers praying in their own language, out loud, with no concern of Satan intercepting the prayer.
Even if Satan and/or his demons hear and understand the prayers we pray, they have absolutely no power to prevent God from answering the prayers according to His will.
We know that God hears our prayers, and that fact makes it irrelevant whether Satan and his demons hear and understand our prayers.
Some understand praying in tongues to be a “secret code language” that prevents Satan and his demons from understanding our prayers and thereby gaining an advantage over us.
We must view our experiences in light of Scripture, not interpret Scripture in light of our experiences.
Second, many of the cults and world religions also report occurrences of speaking in tongues/praying in tongues.
Obviously the Holy Spirit is not gifting these unbelieving individuals.
So, it seems that the demons are able to counterfeit the gift of speaking in tongues.
This should cause us to compare even more carefully our experiences with Scripture.
Third, studies have shown how speaking/praying in tongues can be a learned behavior.
Through hearing and observing others speak in tongues, a person can learn the procedure, even subconsciously.
This is the most likely explanation for the vast majority of instances of speaking/praying in tongues among Christians.
Fourth, the feeling of “self-edification” is natural.
The human body produces adrenaline and endorphins when it experiences something new, exciting, emotional, and/or disconnected from rational thought.
Praying in tongues is most definitely an issue on which Christians can respectfully and lovingly agree to disagree.
So, while we believe the biblical interpretation of praying in tongues leads away from the idea of a private prayer language for personal edification, we also recognize that many who practice such are our brothers and sisters in Christ and are worthy of our love and respect.
Praying in tongues is not what separates a mature Christian from an immature Christian.
Whether or not there is such a thing as praying in tongues as a personal prayer language is not a fundamental of the Christian faith.
So, while we believe the biblical interpretation of praying in tongues leads away from the idea of a private prayer language for personal edification, we also recognize that many who practice such are our brothers and sisters in Christ and are worthy of our love and respect.

 Romans 8:29-30 tells us, “For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
 Romans 8:29-30 tells us, “For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
The most common objection to the doctrine of predestination is that it is unfair.
However, predestination is a biblical doctrine.
The key is understanding what predestination means, biblically.
The words translated “predestined” in the Scriptures referenced above are from the Greek word proorizo, which carries the meaning of “determining beforehand,” “ordaining,” “deciding ahead of time.” So, predestination is God determining certain things to occur ahead of time.
What did God determine ahead of time?
According to Romans 8:29-30, God predetermined that certain individuals would be conformed to the likeness of His Son, be called, justified, and glorified.
Essentially, God predetermines that certain individuals will be saved.
Numerous scriptures refer to believers in Christ being chosen (Matthew 24:22, 31; Mark 13:20, 27; Romans 8:33, 9:11, 11:5-7, 28; Ephesians 1:11; Colossians 3:12; 1 Thessalonians 1:4; 1 Timothy 5:21; 2 Timothy 2:10; Titus 1:1; 1 Peter 1:1-2, 2:9; 2 Peter 1:10).
Predestination is the biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved.
The most common objection to the doctrine of predestination is that it is unfair.
Why would God choose certain individuals and not others?
We have all sinned (Romans 3:23) and are all worthy of eternal punishment (Romans 6:23).
As a result, God would be perfectly just in allowing all of us to spend eternity in hell.
However, God chooses to save some of us.
He is not being unfair to those who are not chosen, because they are receiving what they deserve.
Predestination is the biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved.
No one deserves anything from God; therefore, no one can object if he does not receive anything from God.
An illustration would be a man randomly handing out money to five people in a crowd of twenty.
Would the fifteen people who did not receive money be upset?
Predestination is the biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved.
Because the man did not owe anyone money.
The Bible says that we have the choice—all who believe in Jesus Christ will be saved (John 3:16; Romans 10:9-10).
The Bible never describes God rejecting anyone who believes in Him or turning away anyone who is seeking Him (Deuteronomy 4:29).
Somehow, in the mystery of God, predestination works hand-in-hand with a person being drawn by God (John 6:44) and believing unto salvation (Romans 1:16).
God predestines who will be saved, and we must choose Christ in order to be saved.
An illustration would be a man randomly handing out money to five people in a crowd of twenty.
Romans 11:33 proclaims, “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

                                                                                         Answer
 Premillennialism is the view that Christ’s second coming will occur prior to His millennial kingdom, and that the millennial kingdom is a literal 1000-year reign of Christ on earth.
In order to understand and interpret the passages in Scripture that deal with end-times events, there are two things that must be clearly understood: a proper method of interpreting Scripture and the distinction between Israel (the Jews) and the church (the body of all believers in Jesus Christ).
First, a proper method of interpreting Scripture requires that Scripture be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its context.
This means that a passage must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the audience to which it is written, those it is written about, whom it is written by, and so on.
It is critical to know the author, intended audience, and historical background of each passage one interprets.
The historical and cultural setting will often reveal the correct meaning of a passage.
It is also important to remember that Scripture interprets Scripture.
That is, often a passage will cover a topic or subject that is also addressed elsewhere in the Bible.
It is important to interpret all of these passages consistently with one another.
Finally, and most importantly, passages must always be taken in their normal, regular, plain, literal meaning unless the context of the passage indicates that it is figurative in nature.
A literal interpretation does not eliminate the possibility of figures of speech being used.
Rather, it encourages the interpreter to not read figurative language into the meaning of a passage unless it is appropriate for that context.
It is crucial to never seek a “deeper, more spiritual” meaning than is presented.
Spiritualizing a passage is dangerous because it moves the basis for accurate interpretation from Scripture to the mind of the reader.
Then, there can be no objective standard of interpretation; instead, Scripture becomes subject to each person’s own impression of what it means.
Second Peter 1:20-21 reminds us that “no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation.
Second Peter 1:20-21 reminds us that “no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation.
 Applying these principles of biblical interpretation, it must be seen that Israel (Abraham’s physical descendants) and the church (all New Testament believers) are two distinct groups.
It is crucial to recognize that Israel and the church are distinct because, if this is misunderstood, Scripture will be misinterpreted.
Especially prone to misinterpretation are passages that deal with promises made to Israel (both fulfilled and unfulfilled).
Such promises should not be applied to the church.
Remember, the context of the passage will determine to whom it is addressed and will point to the most correct interpretation.
With those concepts in mind, we can look at various passages of Scripture that produce the premillennial view.
 God promises Abraham three things here: Abraham would have many descendants, this nation would own and occupy a land, and a universal blessing will come to all mankind out of Abraham’s line (the Jews).
I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.’”
Genesis 12:1-3: “The LORD had said to Abram, ‘Leave your country, your people and your father’s household and go to the land I will show you.
 God promises Abraham three things here: Abraham would have many descendants, this nation would own and occupy a land, and a universal blessing will come to all mankind out of Abraham’s line (the Jews).
In Genesis 15:9-17, God ratifies His covenant with Abraham.
By the way this is done, God places sole responsibility for the covenant upon Himself.
That is, there was nothing Abraham could do or fail to do that would void the covenant God made.
Also in this passage, the boundaries are set for the land that the Jews will eventually occupy.
For a detailed list of the boundaries, see Deuteronomy 34.
Other passages that deal with the promise of land are Deuteronomy 30:3-5 and Ezekiel 20:42-44.
In 2 Samuel 7:10-17, we see the promise made by God to King David.
Here, God promises David that he will have descendants, and out of those descendants God will establish an eternal kingdom.
This is referring to the rule of Christ during the millennium and forever.
It is important to keep in mind that this promise must be fulfilled literally and has not yet taken place.
Some would believe that the rule of Solomon was the literal fulfillment of this prophecy, but there is a problem with that.
The territory over which Solomon ruled is not held by Israel today, and neither does Solomon rule over Israel today.
Remember that God promised Abraham that his descendants would possess a land forever.
Also, 2 Samuel 7 says that God would establish a king who would rule for eternity.
Solomon could not be a fulfillment of the promise made to David.
Therefore, this is a promise that has yet to be fulfilled.
Now, with all this in mind, examine what is recorded in Revelation 20:1-7.
The thousand years which is repeatedly mentioned in this passage corresponds to Christ’s literal 1000-year reign on the earth.
Recall that the promise made to David regarding a ruler had to be fulfilled literally and has not yet taken place.
Premillennialism sees this passage as describing the future fulfillment of that promise with Christ on the throne.
Premillennialism is the only system that agrees with a literal interpretation of God’s covenants and end-times prophecy.
Neither of these covenants has been fully or permanently fulfilled.
A literal, physical rule of Christ is the only way the covenants can be fulfilled as God promised they would.
Applying a literal method of interpretation to Scripture results in the pieces of the puzzle coming together.
All of the Old Testament prophecies of Jesus’ first coming were fulfilled literally.
Therefore, we should expect the prophecies regarding His second coming to be fulfilled literally as well.
Premillennialism is the only system that agrees with a literal interpretation of God’s covenants and end-times prophecy.

 Spiritual growth is the process of becoming more and more like Jesus Christ.
When we place our faith in Jesus, the Holy Spirit begins the process of making us more like Him, conforming us to His image.
Spiritual growth is perhaps best described in 2 Peter 1:3-8, which tells us that by God’s power we have “everything we need” to live lives of godliness, which is the goal of spiritual growth.
Notice that what we need comes “through our knowledge of Him,” which is the key to obtaining everything we need.
Our knowledge of Him comes from the Word, given to us for our edification and growth.
There are two lists in Galatians 5:19-23.
Verses 19-21 list the “acts of the flesh.” These are the things that identified our lives before we came to Christ for salvation.
These are what should characterize our lives now that we have experienced salvation in Jesus Christ.
The acts of the flesh are the activities we are to confess, repent of, and, with God’s help, overcome.
As we experience spiritual growth, fewer and fewer of the “acts of the flesh” will be evident in our lives.
The second list is the “fruit of the Spirit” (verses 22-23).
These are what should characterize our lives now that we have experienced salvation in Jesus Christ.
Spiritual growth is identified by the fruit of the Spirit becoming increasingly evident in a believer’s life.
When the transformation of salvation takes place, spiritual growth begins.
The Holy Spirit indwells us (John 14:16-17).
We are new creatures in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17).
The old, sinful nature begins to give way to the new, Christlike nature (Romans 6-7).
Spiritual growth is a lifelong process that depends on our study and application of God’s Word (2 Timothy 3:16-17) and our walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16-26).
As we seek spiritual growth, we should pray to God and ask for wisdom concerning the areas He desires us to grow in.
As we seek spiritual growth, we should pray to God and ask for wisdom concerning the areas He desires us to grow in.
God desires for us to grow spiritually, and He has given us all we need to experience spiritual growth.

 “Systematic” refers to something being put into a system.
Systematic theology is, therefore, the division of theology into systems that explain its various areas.
For example, many books of the Bible give information about the angels.
No one book gives all the information about the angels.
Systematic theology takes all the information about angels from all the books of the Bible and organizes it into a system called angelology.
That is what systematic theology is all about—organizing the teachings of the Bible into categorical systems.
Hamartiology is the study of sin.
Systematic theology is an important tool in helping us to understand and teach the Bible in an organized manner.
In addition to systematic theology, there are other ways that theology can be divided.
Biblical theology is the study of a certain book (or books) of the Bible and emphasizing the different aspects of theology it focuses on.
For example, the Gospel of John is very Christological since it focuses so much on the deity of Christ (John 1:1, 14; 8:58; 10:30; 20:28).
Historical theology is the study of doctrines and how they have developed over the centuries of the Christian church.
Dogmatic theology is the study of the doctrines of certain Christian groups that have systematized doctrine—for example, Calvinistic theology and dispensational theology.
Contemporary theology is the study of doctrines that have developed or come into focus in recent times.
No matter what method of theology is studied, what is important is that theology is studied.

In other words, “the main things are the plain things.” One of the topics not explicitly addressed in Scripture is the age of the earth.
One method of determining the age of the earth assumes that the six days of creation presented in Genesis 1 were literal 24-hour periods and that there are no gaps in the chronology or genealogy of Genesis.
The years listed in the genealogies of Genesis are then added to get an approximate time from creation to certain Old Testament figures.
One method of determining the age of the earth assumes that the six days of creation presented in Genesis 1 were literal 24-hour periods and that there are no gaps in the chronology or genealogy of Genesis.
Some measures of the age of Earth do not seem to support it being as young as 6,000 years, and denying such evidence requires the suggestion that God made virtually every aspect of the universe “appear” to be old, for some reason.
On the other hand, radiometric dating is only useful or accurate back to a certain point, far less than the scale involved in dating the earth.
Despite claims to the contrary, many Christians who hold to an old earth view take the Bible to be infallible and inspired, but they differ on the proper interpretation of a select few verses.
We believe that Genesis 1–2 is literal, and young earth creationism is what a literal reading of those chapters presents.
Topics such as the age of the earth are why Paul urged believers not to cause strife over things not detailed in the Bible (Romans 14:1–10; Titus 3:9).
                                                                                         Answer

 The baptism of the Holy Spirit may be defined as that work whereby the Spirit of God places the believer into union with Christ and into union with other believers in the body of Christ at the moment of salvation.
First Corinthians 12:12–13 is the central passage in the Bible regarding the baptism of the Holy Spirit: “For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink” (1 Corinthians 12:13).
First Corinthians 12:12–13 is the central passage in the Bible regarding the baptism of the Holy Spirit: “For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink” (1 Corinthians 12:13).
While Romans 6:1–4 does not mention specifically the Spirit of God, it does describe the believer’s position before God in language similar to the 1 Corinthians passage: “What shall we say, then?
We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”
Notice that we “all” have been baptized by the Spirit—all believers have received the baptism, synonymous with salvation, and it is not a special experience for only a few.
 The following facts are necessary to help solidify our understanding of Spirit baptism: First, 1 Corinthians 12:13 clearly states that all have been baptized, just as all been given the Spirit to drink (the indwelling of the Spirit).
Second, nowhere in Scripture are believers told to be baptized with, in or by the Spirit, or in any sense to seek the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
This indicates that all believers have had this experience.
Third, Ephesians 4:5 seems to refer to Spirit baptism.
If this is the case, Spirit baptism is the reality for every believer, just as “one faith” and “one Father” are.
In conclusion, the baptism of the Holy Spirit does two things, 1) it joins us to the body of Christ, and 2) it actualizes our co-crucifixion with Christ.
Being in His body means we are risen with Him to newness of life (Romans 6:4).
We should then exercise our spiritual gifts to keep that body functioning properly as stated in the context of 1 Corinthians 12:13.
Experiencing the one Spirit baptism serves as the basis for keeping the unity of the church, as in the context of Ephesians 4:5.
Being associated with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection through Spirit baptism establishes the basis for our separation from the power of indwelling sin and our walk in newness of life (Romans 6:1-10; Colossians 2:12).

                                                                                         Answer
 The concept of “blasphemy against the Spirit” is mentioned in Mark 3:22–30 and Matthew 12:22–32.
The term blasphemy may be generally defined as “defiant irreverence.” The term can be applied to such sins as cursing God or willfully degrading things relating to God.
Blasphemy is also attributing some evil to God or denying Him some good that we should attribute to Him.
Blasphemy is also attributing some evil to God or denying Him some good that we should attribute to Him.
This particular case of blasphemy, however, is called “the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” in Matthew 12:31.
Jesus rebuts the Pharisees with some logical arguments for why He is not casting out demons in the power of Satan (Matthew 12:25–29).
Notice in Mark 3:30 Jesus is very specific about what the Pharisees did to commit blasphemy against the Holy Spirit: “He said this because they were saying, ‘He has an impure spirit.’”
 Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has to do with accusing Jesus Christ of being demon-possessed instead of Spirit-filled.
This particular type of blasphemy cannot be duplicated today.
Jesus Christ is not on earth—He is seated at the right hand of God.
No one can personally witness Jesus performing a miracle and then attribute that power to Satan instead of the Spirit.

The unpardonable sin today is the state of continued unbelief.

The love of God is evident: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
And the choice is clear: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on him” (John 3:36).

Jesus began to veil the truth with parables and metaphors as a direct result of the Jewish leaders’ official denunciation of Him.

If they were not believers, they are in hell, suffering unending torment for rejecting God’s love and rebelling against Him.
Sometimes by just using a telephone number through caller ID and an internet search, a psychic can get names, addresses, dates of birth, dates of marriage, family members, etc.
It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness.
Acts 16:16-18 describes a fortune teller who was able to predict the future until the apostle Paul rebuked a demon out of her.
 The Bible strongly condemns spiritism, mediums, the occult, and psychics (Leviticus 20:27; Deuteronomy 18:10-13).
                                                                                         Answer
Whatever the case and wherever the source of the information, nothing connected to spiritism, witchcraft, or astrology is a godly means of discovering information.
                                                                                         Answer
 Many people today understand the church as a building.
The word “church” is a translation of the Greek word ekklesia, which is defined as “an assembly” or “called-out ones.” The root meaning of church is not that of a building, but of people.

It is ironic that when you ask people what church they attend, they usually identify a building.
Romans 16:5 says, “Greet the church that is in their house.” Paul refers to the church in their house—not a church building, but a body of believers.
Romans 16:5 says, “Greet the church that is in their house.” Paul refers to the church in their house—not a church building, but a body of believers.
The church is the body of Christ, of which He is the head.
Ephesians 1:22–23 says, “And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.” The body of Christ is made up of all believers in Jesus Christ from the day of Pentecost (Acts 2) until Christ’s return.
This verse says that anyone who believes is part of the body of Christ and has received the Spirit of Christ as evidence.

and all the brothers with me, to the churches in Galatia.” Here we see that in the province of Galatia there were many churches—they had a localized ministry and were scattered throughout the province.
A Baptist church, a Lutheran church, an E-Free church, etc., is not the church, as in the universal church; rather, it is a local church, a local body of believers.
The universal church is comprised of everyone who belongs to Christ.
Members of the universal church should seek fellowship and edification in a local church.
In summary, the church is not a building or a denomination.
According to the Bible, the church is the body of Christ—all those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ for salvation (John 3:16; 1 Corinthians 12:13).
The universal church is comprised of everyone who belongs to Christ.
The local church is where believers can fully apply the “body” principles of 1 Corinthians chapter 12—encouraging, teaching, and building one another up in the knowledge and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
 Questions about the Church

                                                                                         Answer
 Sin is described in the Bible as transgression of the law of God (1 John 3:4) and rebellion against God (Deuteronomy 9:7; Joshua 1:18).
Renamed Satan, he brought sin to the human race in the Garden of Eden, where he tempted Adam and Eve with the same enticement, “you shall be like God.” Genesis 3 describes Adam and Eve’s rebellion against God and against His command.
Since that time, sin has been passed down through all the generations of mankind and we, Adam’s descendants, have inherited sin from him.
Romans 5:12 tells us that through Adam sin entered the world, and so death was passed on to all men because “the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).
Through Adam, the inherent inclination to sin entered the human race, and human beings became sinners by nature.
When Adam sinned, his inner nature was transformed by his sin of rebellion, bringing to him spiritual death and depravity which would be passed on to all who came after him.
We are sinners not because we sin; rather, we sin because we are sinners.
This passed-on depravity is known as inherited sin.
Just as we inherit physical characteristics from our parents, we inherit our sinful natures from Adam.
King David lamented this condition of fallen human nature in Psalm 51:5: “Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.”
Renamed Satan, he brought sin to the human race in the Garden of Eden, where he tempted Adam and Eve with the same enticement, “you shall be like God.” Genesis 3 describes Adam and Eve’s rebellion against God and against His command.
 Another type of sin is known as imputed sin.
Used in both financial and legal settings, the Greek word translated “imputed” means “to take something that belongs to someone and credit it to another’s account.” Before the Law of Moses was given, sin was not imputed to man, although men were still sinners because of inherited sin.
Through Adam, the inherent inclination to sin entered the human race, and human beings became sinners by nature.
After the Law was given, sins committed in violation of the Law were imputed (accounted) to them (Romans 5:13).
Even before transgressions of the law were imputed to men, the ultimate penalty for sin (death) continued to reign (Romans 5:14).
All humans, from Adam to Moses, were subject to death, not because of their sinful acts against the Mosaic Law (which they did not have), but because of their own inherited sinful nature.
Used in both financial and legal settings, the Greek word translated “imputed” means “to take something that belongs to someone and credit it to another’s account.” Before the Law of Moses was given, sin was not imputed to man, although men were still sinners because of inherited sin.
God used the principle of imputation to benefit mankind when He imputed the sin of believers to the account of Jesus Christ, who paid the penalty for that sin—death—on the cross.
Imputing our sin to Jesus, God treated Him as if He were a sinner, though He was not, and had Him die for the sins of the entire world (1 John 2:2).
It is important to understand that sin was imputed to Him, but He did not inherit it from Adam.
God used the principle of imputation to benefit mankind when He imputed the sin of believers to the account of Jesus Christ, who paid the penalty for that sin—death—on the cross.
God used the principle of imputation to benefit mankind when He imputed the sin of believers to the account of Jesus Christ, who paid the penalty for that sin—death—on the cross.
He was treated as though He were guilty of all the sins ever committed by the human race, even though He committed none.
In exchange, God imputed the righteousness of Christ to believers and credited our accounts with His righteousness, just as He had credited our sins to Christ’s account (2 Corinthians 5:21).
A third type of sin is personal sin, that which is committed every day by every human being.
Because we have inherited a sin nature from Adam, we commit individual, personal sins, everything from seemingly innocent untruths to murder.
Those who have not placed their faith in Jesus Christ must pay the penalty for these personal sins, as well as inherited and imputed sin.
However, believers have been freed from the eternal penalty of sin—hell and spiritual death—but now we also have the power to resist sinning.
Now we can choose whether or not to commit personal sins because we have the power to resist sin through the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, sanctifying and convicting us of our sins when we do commit them (Romans 8:9-11).
Once we confess our personal sins to God and ask forgiveness for them, we are restored to perfect fellowship and communion with Him.
“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).
We are all three times condemned due to inherited sin, imputed sin, and personal sin.
The only just penalty for this sin is death (Romans 6:23), not just physical death but eternal death (Revelation 20:11-15).
Thankfully, inherited sin, imputed sin, and personal sin have all been crucified on the cross of Jesus, and now by faith in Jesus Christ as the Savior “we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7).
 Questions about Sin
Thankfully, inherited sin, imputed sin, and personal sin have all been crucified on the cross of Jesus, and now by faith in Jesus Christ as the Savior “we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7).
                                                                                         Answer
 There are similarities and differences between talents and spiritual gifts.
Both are gifts from God.
Both grow in effectiveness with use.
Both are intended to be used on behalf of others, not for selfish purposes.
First Corinthians 12:7 states that spiritual gifts are given to benefit others and not ourselves.
As the two great commandments deal with loving God and others, it follows that one should use his talents for those purposes.
But to whom and when talents and spiritual gifts are given differs.
A person (regardless of his belief in God or in Christ) is given a natural talent as a result of a combination of genetics (some have natural ability in music, art, or mathematics) and surroundings (growing up in a musical family will aid one in developing a talent for music), or because God desired to endow certain individuals with certain talents (for example, Bezalel in Exodus 31:1-6).
Spiritual gifts are given to all believers by the Holy Spirit (Romans 12:3, 6) at the time they place their faith in Christ for the forgiveness of their sins.
At that moment, the Holy Spirit gives to the new believer the spiritual gift(s) He desires the believer to have (1 Corinthians 12:11).
Romans 12:3-8 lists the spiritual gifts as follows: prophecy, serving others (in a general sense), teaching, exhorting, generosity, leadership, and showing mercy.
First Corinthians 12:8-11 lists the gifts as the word of wisdom (ability to communicate spiritual wisdom), the word of knowledge (ability to communicate practical truth), faith (unusual reliance upon God), the working of miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, tongues (ability to speak in a language that one has not studied), and interpretation of tongues.
The third list is found in Ephesians 4:10-12, which speaks of God giving to His church apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor-teachers.
There is also a question as to how many spiritual gifts there are, as no two lists are the same.
It is also possible that the biblical lists are not exhaustive, that there are additional spiritual gifts beyond the ones the Bible mentions.
While one may develop his talents and later direct his profession or hobby along those lines, spiritual gifts were given by the Holy Spirit for the building up of Christ’s church.
In that, all Christians are to play an active part in the furtherance of the gospel of Christ.
All are called and equipped to be involved in the “work of the ministry” (Ephesians 4:12).
All are gifted so that they can contribute to the cause of Christ out of gratitude for all He has done for them.
In doing so, they also find fulfillment in life through their labor for Christ.
It is the job of the church leaders to help build up the saints so they can be further equipped for the ministry to which God has called them.
The intended result of spiritual gifts is that the church as a whole can grow, being strengthened by the combined supply of each member of Christ’s body.
To summarize the differences between spiritual gifts and talents: 1) A talent is the result of genetics and/or training, while a spiritual gift is the result of the power of the Holy Spirit.
2) A talent can be possessed by anyone, Christian or non-Christian, while spiritual gifts are only possessed by Christians.
3) While both talents and spiritual gifts should be used for God’s glory and to minister to others, spiritual gifts are focused on these tasks, while talents can be used entirely for non-spiritual purposes.

                                                                                         Answer
 The soul and the spirit are the two primary immaterial parts that Scripture ascribes to humanity.
It can be confusing to attempt to discern the precise differences between the two.
The word spirit refers only to the immaterial facet of humanity.
Human beings have a spirit, but we are not spirits.
However, in Scripture, only believers are said to be spiritually alive (1 Corinthians 2:11; Hebrews 4:12; James 2:26), while unbelievers are spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1–5; Colossians 2:13).
In Paul’s writing, the spiritual is pivotal to the life of the believer (1 Corinthians 2:14; 3:1; Ephesians 1:3; 5:19; Colossians 1:9; 3:16).
The spirit is the element in humanity that gives us the ability to have an intimate relationship with God.
Whenever the word spirit is used, it refers to the immaterial part of humanity that “connects” with God, who Himself is spirit (John 4:24).
The word soul can refer to both the immaterial and material aspects of humanity.
Unlike human beings having a spirit, human beings are souls.
In its most basic sense, the word soul means “life”; however, beyond this essential meaning, the Bible speaks of the soul in many contexts.
Whenever the word spirit is used, it refers to the immaterial part of humanity that “connects” with God, who Himself is spirit (John 4:24).
One of these is in relation to humanity’s eagerness to sin (Luke 12:26).
Human beings have a sinful nature, and our souls are tainted with sin.
The soul, as with the spirit, is the center of many spiritual and emotional experiences (Job 30:25; Psalm 43:5; Jeremiah 13:17).
The soul, as with the spirit, is the center of many spiritual and emotional experiences (Job 30:25; Psalm 43:5; Jeremiah 13:17).
The word soul can refer to the whole person, whether alive on earth or in the afterlife.
The soul and the spirit are connected, but separable (Hebrews 4:12).
The soul is the essence of humanity’s being; it is who we are.
The spirit is the immaterial part of humanity that connects with God.

 The filioque clause was, and still is, a controversy in the church in relation to the Holy Spirit.
The question is, “from whom did the Holy Spirit proceed, the Father, or the Father and the Son?” The word filioque means “and son” in Latin.
It is referred to as the “filioque clause” because the phrase “and son” was added to the Nicene Creed, indicating that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father “and Son.” There was so much contention over this issue that it eventually led to the split between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches in A. D. 1054.

D. 1054.
The two churches are still not in agreement on the filioque clause.
John 14:26 tells us, “But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name...” John 15:26 tells us, “When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, He will testify about me.” See also John 14:16 and Philippians 1:19.
John 14:26 tells us, “But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name...” John 15:26 tells us, “When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, He will testify about me.” See also John 14:16 and Philippians 1:19.
These Scriptures seem to indicate that the Spirit is sent out by both the Father and the Son.
The essential matter in the filioque clause is a desire to protect the deity of the Holy Spirit.
The Bible clearly teaches that the Holy Spirit is God (Acts 5:3-4).
Those who oppose the filioque clause object because they believe the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son makes the Holy Spirit “subservient” to the Father and Son.
Those who uphold the filioque clause believe that the Holy Spirit proceeding from both the Father and the Son does not impact the Spirit being equally God with the Father and the Son.
The filioque clause controversy likely involves an aspect of God’s person that we will never be able to fully grasp.
God, who is an infinite being, is ultimately incomprehensible to our finite human minds.
The Holy Spirit is God, and He was sent by God as Jesus Christ’s “replacement” here on earth.
The question of whether the Holy Spirit was sent by the Father, or by the Father and the Son, likely cannot be decisively answered, nor does it absolutely need to be.
The filioque clause will perhaps have to remain a controversy.
 Questions about the Holy Spirit
    What is the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit?
                                                                                         Answer
 Galatians 5:22-23 tells us, “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.” The fruit of the Holy Spirit is the result of the Holy Spirit’s presence in the life of a Christian.
One of the primary purposes of the Holy Spirit coming into a Christian’s life is to change that life.
The Bible makes it clear that everyone receives the Holy Spirit the moment he or she believes in Jesus Christ (Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 1:13-14).
It is one of the main purposes of the Christian life, though, to progressively allow the Holy Spirit to produce more and more of His fruit in our lives—and to allow the Holy Spirit to conquer the opposing sinful desires.
It is the Holy Spirit’s job to conform us to the image of Christ, making us more like Him.
The fruit of the Holy Spirit is in direct contrast with the acts of the sinful nature in Galatians 5:19-21, “The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like.
I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.” This passage describes all people, to varying degrees, when they do not know Christ and therefore are not under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.” This passage describes all people, to varying degrees, when they do not know Christ and therefore are not under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
Our sinful flesh produces certain types of fruit that reflect our nature, and the Holy Spirit produces types of fruit that reflect His nature.
As Christians, we have the Holy Spirit producing His fruit in us and we have the Holy Spirit’s power available to conquer the acts of the sinful nature (2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).
As fallen human beings, we are still trapped in a body that desires sinful things (Romans 7:14-25).
As Christians, we have the Holy Spirit producing His fruit in us and we have the Holy Spirit’s power available to conquer the acts of the sinful nature (2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).
A Christian will never be completely victorious in always demonstrating the fruits of the Holy Spirit.
It is one of the main purposes of the Christian life, though, to progressively allow the Holy Spirit to produce more and more of His fruit in our lives—and to allow the Holy Spirit to conquer the opposing sinful desires.
The fruit of the Spirit is what God desires our lives to exhibit and, with the Holy Spirit’s help, it is possible!

The apostles went out and shared the gospel with the crowds, speaking to them in their own languages: “We hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!” (Acts 2:11).
In 1 Corinthians chapters 12–14, Paul discusses miraculous gifts, saying, “Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?” (1 Corinthians 14:6).
A person with the gift of interpreting tongues (1 Corinthians 12:30) could understand what a tongues-speaker was saying even though he did not know the language that was being spoken.
In 1 Corinthians chapters 12–14, Paul discusses miraculous gifts, saying, “Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?” (1 Corinthians 14:6).
It would be a real and intelligible language (1 Corinthians 14:10).
In 1 Corinthians chapters 12–14, Paul discusses miraculous gifts, saying, “Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?” (1 Corinthians 14:6).
In 1 Corinthians chapters 12–14, Paul discusses miraculous gifts, saying, “Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?” (1 Corinthians 14:6).
It would also be in accordance with 1 Corinthians 14:33, “For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.”
In 1 Corinthians chapters 12–14, Paul discusses miraculous gifts, saying, “Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?” (1 Corinthians 14:6).

Therefore, when God did in fact judge Israel (with the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70), the gift of tongues would no longer serve its intended purpose.
                                                                                         Answer
 The great white throne judgment is described in Revelation 20:11-15 and is the final judgment prior to the lost being cast into the lake of fire.
We know from Revelation 20:7-15 that this judgment will take place after the millennium and after Satan is thrown into the lake of fire where the beast and the false prophet are (Revelation 19:19-20; 20:7-10).
The books that are opened (Revelation 20:12) contain records of everyone’s deeds, whether they are good or evil, because God knows everything that has ever been said, done, or even thought, and He will reward or punish each one accordingly (Psalm 28:4; 62:12; Romans 2:6; Revelation 2:23; 18:6; 22:12).
Also at this time, another book is opened, called the “book of life” (Revelation 20:12).
We also know from Scripture that it is at this judgment when the dead will be “judged according to what they had done” (Revelation 20:12) and that “anyone’s name” that is not “found written in the book of life” will be “thrown into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:15).
Although Christians are held accountable for their actions, they are forgiven in Christ and their names were written in the “book of life from the creation of the world” (Revelation 17:8).
We also know from Scripture that it is at this judgment when the dead will be “judged according to what they had done” (Revelation 20:12) and that “anyone’s name” that is not “found written in the book of life” will be “thrown into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:15).
The fact that there is going to be a final judgment for all men, both believers and unbelievers, is clearly confirmed in many passages of Scripture.
Every person will one day stand before Christ and be judged for his or her deeds.
While it is very clear that the great white throne judgment is the final judgment, Christians disagree on how it relates to the other judgments mentioned in the Bible, specifically, who will be judged at the great white throne judgment.
Some Christians believe that the Scriptures reveal three different judgments to come.
The first is the judgment of the sheep and the goats or a judgment of the nations (Matthew 25:31-36).
This takes place after the tribulation period but prior to the millennium; its purpose is to determine who will enter the millennial kingdom.
The second is a judgment of believers’ works, often referred to as the “judgment seat [bema] of Christ” (2 Corinthians 5:10).
Every person will one day stand before Christ and be judged for his or her deeds.
The third is the great white throne judgment at the end of the millennium (Revelation 20:11-15).
While it is very clear that the great white throne judgment is the final judgment, Christians disagree on how it relates to the other judgments mentioned in the Bible, specifically, who will be judged at the great white throne judgment.
Other Christians believe that all three of these judgments speak of the same final judgment, not of three separate judgments.
In other words, the great white throne judgment in Revelation 20:11-15 will be the time that believers and unbelievers alike are judged.
First, Jesus Christ will be the judge, all unbelievers will be judged by Christ, and they will be punished according to the works they have done.
First, Jesus Christ will be the judge, all unbelievers will be judged by Christ, and they will be punished according to the works they have done.
Those who hold this view believe that Matthew 25:31-46 is another description of what takes place at the great white throne judgment.
They point to the fact that the result of this judgment is the same as what is seen after the great white throne judgment in Revelation 20:11-15.
The sheep (believers) enter into eternal life, while the goats (unbelievers) are cast into “eternal punishment” (Matthew 25:46).
Whichever view one holds of the great white throne judgment, it is important to never lose sight of the facts concerning the coming judgment(s).
First, Jesus Christ will be the judge, all unbelievers will be judged by Christ, and they will be punished according to the works they have done.
The Bible is very clear that unbelievers are storing up wrath against themselves (Romans 2:5) and that God will “give to each person according to what he has done” (Romans 2:6).
Believers will also be judged by Christ, but since Christ’s righteousness has been imputed to us and our names are written in the book of life, we will be rewarded, but not punished, according to our deeds.
Romans 14:10-12 says that we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ and that each one of us will give an account to God.

Romans 6:4 puts it this way: “We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”
First Corinthians 12:13 says, “We were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.” Baptism by water is a “reenactment” of the baptism by the Spirit.

 A study of the Lord’s Supper is a soul-stirring experience because of the depth of meaning it contains.
It was during the age-old celebration of the Passover on the eve of His death that Jesus instituted a significant new fellowship meal that we observe to this day.
It was during the age-old celebration of the Passover on the eve of His death that Jesus instituted a significant new fellowship meal that we observe to this day.
It causes us to remember our Lord’s death and resurrection and to look for His glorious return in the future.
The Passover was the most sacred feast of the Jewish religious year.
It commemorated the final plague on Egypt when the firstborn of the Egyptians died and the Israelites were spared because of the blood of a lamb that was sprinkled on their doorposts.
The lamb was then roasted and eaten with unleavened bread.
God’s command was that throughout the generations to come the feast would be celebrated.
The story is recorded in Exodus 12.
During the Last Supper—a Passover celebration—Jesus took a loaf of bread and gave thanks to God.
As He broke it and gave it to His disciples, He said, “‘This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you’” (Luke 22:19-21).
As He broke it and gave it to His disciples, He said, “‘This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you’” (Luke 22:19-21).
He concluded the feast by singing a hymn (Matthew 26:30), and they went out into the night to the Mount of Olives.
It was there that, as predicted, Jesus was betrayed by Judas.
The following day Jesus was crucified.
The accounts of the Lord’s Supper are found in the Gospels (Matthew 26:26-29; Mark 14:17-25; Luke 22:7-22; and John 13:21-30).
The apostle Paul wrote concerning the Lord’s Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23-29.
Paul includes a statement not found in the Gospels: “Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself” (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).
We may ask what it means to partake of the bread and the cup “in an unworthy manner.” It may mean to disregard the true meaning of the bread and cup and to forget the tremendous price our Savior paid for our salvation.
We may ask what it means to partake of the bread and the cup “in an unworthy manner.” It may mean to disregard the true meaning of the bread and cup and to forget the tremendous price our Savior paid for our salvation.
Or it may mean to allow the ceremony to become a dead and formal ritual or to come to the Lord’s Supper with unconfessed sin.
In keeping with Paul’s instruction, we should examine ourselves before eating the bread and drinking the cup.
Another statement Paul made that is not included in the gospel accounts is “For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes” (1 Corinthians 11:26).
Another statement Paul made that is not included in the gospel accounts is “For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes” (1 Corinthians 11:26).
From these brief accounts we learn how Jesus used two of the frailest of elements as symbols of His body and blood and established them as a monument to His death.
It was not a monument of carved marble or molded brass, but of bread and wine.
He declared that the bread spoke of His body which would be broken.
There was not a broken bone, but His body was so badly tortured that it was hardly recognizable (Psalm 22:12-17; Isaiah 53:4-7).
The wine spoke of His blood, indicating the terrible death He would soon experience.
He, the perfect Son of God, became the fulfillment of the countless Old Testament prophecies concerning a Redeemer (Genesis 3:15; Psalm 22; Isaiah 53).
When He said, “Do this in remembrance of me,” He indicated this was a ceremony that must be continued in the future.
It indicated also that the Passover, which required the death of a lamb and looked forward to the coming of the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world, was fulfilled in the Lord’s Supper.
The New Covenant replaced the Old Covenant when Christ, the Passover Lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7), was sacrificed (Hebrews 8:8-13).
The sacrificial system was no longer needed (Hebrews 9:25-28).
The Lord’s Supper/Christian Communion is a remembrance of what Christ did for us and a celebration of what we receive as a result of His sacrifice.

 The Intelligent Design Theory says that intelligent causes are necessary to explain the complex, information-rich structures of biology and that these causes are empirically detectable.
One of the arguments for Intelligent Design, irreducible complexity, is defined as “a single system which is composed of several well-matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.” Simply put, life is comprised of intertwined parts that rely on each other in order to be useful.

Biblical creationists conclude that the Genesis account of creation is reliable and correct, and so life on Earth was designed by an intelligent agent: God.

 Romans 14:10–12 says, “For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat.
Second Corinthians 5:10 tells us, “We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.” In context, it is clear that both passages refer to Christians, not unbelievers.
Second Corinthians 5:10 tells us, “We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.” In context, it is clear that both passages refer to Christians, not unbelievers.
The judgment seat of Christ, therefore, involves believers giving an account of their lives to Christ.
The judgment seat of Christ does not determine salvation; that was determined by Christ’s sacrifice on our behalf (1 John 2:2) and our faith in Him (John 3:16).
All of our sins are forgiven, and we will never be condemned for them (Romans 8:1).
We should not look at the judgment seat of Christ as God judging our sins, but rather as God rewarding us for our lives.
We should not look at the judgment seat of Christ as God judging our sins, but rather as God rewarding us for our lives.

James 1:12 is a good summary of how we should think about the judgment seat of Christ: “Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.”
At the judgment seat of Christ, believers are rewarded based on how faithfully they served Christ (1 Corinthians 9:4-27; 2 Timothy 2:5).
Some of the things we might be judged on are how well we obeyed the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20), how victorious we were over sin (Romans 6:1-4), and how well we controlled our tongues (James 3:1-9).
The Bible speaks of believers receiving crowns for different things based on how faithfully they served Christ (1 Corinthians 9:4-27; 2 Timothy 2:5).
The various crowns are described in 2 Timothy 2:5, 2 Timothy 4:8, James 1:12, 1 Peter 5:4, and Revelation 2:10.
James 1:12 is a good summary of how we should think about the judgment seat of Christ: “Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.”

   Your Eternal Reward: Triumph &amp; Tears at the Judgment Seat of Christ by Erwin Lutzer

 The Lord’s Prayer is a prayer the Lord Jesus taught His disciples in Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4.
Matthew 6:9-13 says, “This, then, is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Matthew 6:9-13 says, “This, then, is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
'“ Many people misunderstand the Lord’s Prayer to be a prayer we are supposed to recite word for word.
Some people treat the Lord’s Prayer as a magic formula, as if the words themselves have some specific power or influence with God.
 The Lord’s Prayer is a prayer the Lord Jesus taught His disciples in Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4.
In prayer, we are to pour out our hearts to God (Philippians 4:6-7), not simply recite memorized words to God.
“But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen.
For they think that they will be heard for their many words” (Matthew 6:6-7).
In prayer, we are to pour out our hearts to God (Philippians 4:6-7), not simply recite memorized words to God.
The Lord’s Prayer should be understood as an example, a pattern, of how to pray.
It gives us the “ingredients” that should go into prayer.
Here is how it breaks down.
“Our Father in heaven” is teaching us whom to address our prayers to—the Father.
“Hallowed be your name” is telling us to worship God, and to praise Him for who He is.
The phrase “your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” is a reminder to us that we are to pray for God’s plan in our lives and the world, not our own plan.
We are to pray for God’s will to be done, not for our desires.
In prayer, we are to pour out our hearts to God (Philippians 4:6-7), not simply recite memorized words to God.
We are encouraged to ask God for the things we need in “give us today our daily bread.” “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors” reminds us to confess our sins to God and to turn from them, and also to forgive others as God has forgiven us.
The conclusion of the Lord’s Prayer, “And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one” is a plea for help in achieving victory over sin and a request for protection from the attacks of the devil.
Is there anything wrong with memorizing the Lord’s Prayer?
It is only an example of how we should be praying.
So, again, the Lord’s Prayer is not a prayer we are to memorize and recite back to God.
In prayer, we are to pour out our hearts to God (Philippians 4:6-7), not simply recite memorized words to God.
Philippians 4:6-7 declares, “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
Philippians 4:6-7 declares, “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”

 What is the meaning of life?
How can purpose, fulfillment, and satisfaction in life be found?
How can something of lasting significance be achieved?
Many people have never stopped to consider these important questions.
They look back years later and wonder why their relationships have fallen apart and why they feel so empty, even though they may have achieved what they set out to accomplish.
An athlete who had reached the pinnacle of his sport was once asked what he wished someone would have told him when he first started playing his sport.
He replied, “I wish that someone would have told me that when you reach the top, there’s nothing there.” Many goals reveal their emptiness only after years have been wasted in their pursuit.
In our humanistic culture, people lose sight of the meaning of life.
They pursue many things, thinking that in them they will find meaning and purpose.
Some of these pursuits include business success, wealth, good relationships, sex, entertainment, and doing good to others.
People have testified that, while they achieved their goals of wealth, relationships, and pleasure, there was still a deep void inside, a feeling of emptiness that nothing seemed to fill.
The author of the book of Ecclesiastes looked for the meaning of life in many vain pursuits.
He describes the feeling of emptiness he felt: “Meaningless!
Meaningless!
.
.
.
Utterly meaningless!
Everything is meaningless” (Ecclesiastes 1:2).
King Solomon, the writer of Ecclesiastes, had wealth beyond measure, wisdom beyond any man of his time or ours, hundreds of women, palaces and gardens that were the envy of kingdoms, the best food and wine, and every form of entertainment available.
He said at one point that anything his heart wanted, he pursued (Ecclesiastes 2:10).
And yet he summed up life “under the sun”—life lived as though all there is to life is what we can see with our eyes and experience with our senses—is meaningless.
What explains this void?
God created us for something beyond what we can experience in the here-and-now.
Solomon said of God, “He has also set eternity in the hearts of men” (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
In our hearts we are aware that the “here-and-now” is not all that there is.
In the book of Genesis, we find a clue to the meaning of life in the fact that God created mankind in His image (Genesis 1:26).
This means that we are more like God than we are like anything else.
We also find that, before mankind fell and the curse of sin came upon the earth, the following things were true: 1) God made man a social creature (Genesis 2:18–25); 2) God gave man work (Genesis 2:15); 3) God had fellowship with man (Genesis 3:8); and 4) God gave man dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26).
These facts have significance related to the meaning of life.
God intended mankind to have fulfillment in life, but our condition (especially touching our fellowship with God) was adversely affected by the fall into sin and the resulting curse upon the earth (Genesis 3).
The book of Revelation shows that God is concerned with restoring the meaning of life to us.
God reveals that He will destroy this present creation and create a new heaven and a new earth.
At that time, He will restore full fellowship with redeemed mankind, while the unredeemed will have been judged unworthy and cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11–15).
The curse of sin will be done away with; there will be no more sin, sorrow, sickness, death, or pain (Revelation 21:4).
God will dwell with mankind, and they shall be His children (Revelation 21:7).
Thus, we come full circle: God created us to have fellowship with Him; man sinned, breaking that fellowship; God restores that fellowship fully in the eternal state.
To go through life achieving everything we set out to achieve only to die separated from God for eternity would be worse than futile!
But God has made a way to not only make eternal bliss possible (Luke 23:43) but also life on earth satisfying and meaningful.
How is this eternal bliss and “heaven on earth” obtained?
The meaning of life restored through Jesus Christ
 The real meaning of life, both now and in eternity, is found in the restoration of our relationship with God.
This restoration is only possible through God’s Son, Jesus Christ, who reconciles us to God (Romans 5:10; Acts 4:12; John 1:12; 14:6).
Salvation and eternal life are gained when we trust in Jesus Christ as Savior.
Once that salvation is received by grace through faith, Christ makes us new creations, and we begin the progressive journey of growing closer to Him and learning to rely on Him.
God wants us to know the meaning of life.
Jesus said, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
A “full” life is logically one that is meaningful and devoid of aimless wandering.
The meaning of life is wrapped up in the glory of God.
In calling His elect, God says, “Bring all who claim me as their God, for I have made them for my glory.
It was I who created them” (Isaiah 43:7, NLT).
The reason we were made is for God’s glory.
Any time we substitute our own glory for God’s, we miss the meaning of life.
“If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it” (Matthew 16:24–25).
“Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4).

 The millennial kingdom is the title given to the 1,000-year reign of Jesus Christ on the earth.
 The millennial kingdom is the title given to the 1,000-year reign of Jesus Christ on the earth.
They understand the 1,000 years as merely a figurative way of saying “a long period of time,” not a literal, physical reign of Jesus Christ on the earth.
However, six times in Revelation 20:2-7, the millennial kingdom is specifically said to be 1,000 years in length.
If God wished to communicate “a long period of time,” He could have easily done so without explicitly and repeatedly mentioning an exact time frame.
The Bible tells us that when Christ returns to the earth He will establish Himself as king in Jerusalem, sitting on the throne of David (Luke 1:32–33).
The unconditional covenants demand a literal, physical return of Christ to establish the kingdom.
The Abrahamic Covenant promised Israel a land, a posterity and ruler, and a spiritual blessing (Genesis 12:1–3).
The Palestinian Covenant promised Israel a restoration to the land and occupation of the land (Deuteronomy 30:1–10).
The Palestinian Covenant promised Israel a restoration to the land and occupation of the land (Deuteronomy 30:1–10).
At the second coming, these covenants will be fulfilled as Israel is re-gathered from the nations (Matthew 24:31), converted (Zechariah 12:10–14), and restored to the land under the rule of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
The Bible speaks of the conditions during the millennium as a perfect environment physically and spiritually.
It will be a time of peace (Micah 4:2–4; Isaiah 32:17–18), joy (Isaiah 61:7, 10), and comfort (Isaiah 40:1–2).
The Bible also tells us that only believers will enter the millennial kingdom.
Because of this, it will be a time of obedience (Jeremiah 31:33), holiness (Isaiah 35:8), truth (Isaiah 65:16), and the knowledge of God (Isaiah 11:9, Habakkuk 2:14).
Christ will rule as king (Isaiah 9:3–7; 11:1–10).
Nobles and governors will also rule (Isaiah 32:1; Matthew 19:28), and Jerusalem will be the political center of the world (Zechariah 8:3).
Revelation 20:2-7 gives the precise time period of the millennial kingdom.
There are countless other passages that point to a literal reign of the Messiah on the earth.
The fulfillment of many of God’s covenants and promises rests on a literal, physical, future kingdom.
There is no solid basis for denying the literal interpretation of the millennial kingdom and its duration being 1,000 years.

 The Bible does not explicitly give us the origin of the different “races” or skin colors in humanity.
In actuality, there is only one race—the human race.
Within the human race is diversity in skin color and other physical characteristics.
Some speculate that when God confused the languages at the tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9), He also created racial diversity.
It is possible that God made genetic changes to humanity to better enable people to survive in different ecologies, such as the darker skin of Africans being better equipped genetically to survive the excessive heat in Africa.
According to this view, God confused the languages, causing humanity to segregate linguistically, and then created genetic racial differences based on where each racial group would eventually settle.
While possible, there is no explicit biblical basis for this view.
The races/skin colors of humanity are nowhere mentioned in connection with the tower of Babel.
At the Tower of Babel, when the different languages came into existence, groups that spoke one language moved away with others of the same language.
In doing so, the gene pool for a specific group shrank dramatically as the group no longer had the entire human population to mix with.
Closer inbreeding took place, and in time certain features were emphasized in these different groups (all of which were present as a possibility in the genetic code).
As further inbreeding occurred through the generations, the gene pool grew smaller and smaller, to the point that people of one language family all had the same or similar features.
Another explanation is that Adam and Eve possessed the genes to produce black, brown, and white offspring (and everything else in between).
This would be similar to how a mixed-race couple sometimes has children that vary in color.
Since God obviously desired humanity to be diverse in appearance, it makes sense that God would have given Adam and Eve the ability to produce children of different skin tones.
Later, the only survivors of the flood were Noah and his wife, Noah’s three sons and their wives—eight people in all (Genesis 7:13).
Perhaps Noah’s daughters-in-law were of different races.
Perhaps Noah’s daughters-in-law were of different races.
Maybe all eight of them were of mixed race, which would mean they possessed the genetics to produce children of different races.
Whatever the explanation, the most important aspect of this question is that we are all the same race, all created by the same God, all created for the same purpose—to glorify Him.

Fault Lines: The Social Justice Movement and Evangelicalism's Looming Catastrophe by Voddie Baucham Jr.
                                                                                         Answer
 Many people ask, “Is there a prayer I can pray that will guarantee my salvation?” It is important to remember that salvation is not received by reciting a prayer or uttering certain words.
John 3:16 tells us, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Salvation is gained by faith (Ephesians 2:8), by receiving Jesus as Savior (John 1:12), and by fully trusting Jesus alone (John 14:6; Acts 4:12), not by reciting a prayer.

If you understand the gospel, believe it to be true, and have accepted Jesus as your salvation, it is good and appropriate to express that faith to God in prayer.
Communicating with God through prayer can be a way to progress from accepting facts about Jesus to fully trusting in Him as Savior.

                                                                                         Answer
The term preterism comes from the Latin praeter, meaning “past.” Thus, preterism is the view that the biblical prophecies concerning the “end times” have already been fulfilled—in the past.
Preterism teaches that every event normally associated with the end times—Christ’s second coming, the tribulation, the resurrection of the dead, the final judgment—has already happened.
Just as a Christian is made a “new creation” (2 Corinthians 5:17), so the world under the New Covenant is a “new earth.” This aspect of preterism can easily lead to a belief in replacement theology.
After Jesus describes some of the end-times happenings, He says, “Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened” (Matthew 24:34).
The preterist takes this to mean that everything Jesus speaks of in Matthew 24 had to have occurred within one generation of His speaking—the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 was therefore “Judgment Day.”
For one thing, God’s covenant with Israel is everlasting (Jeremiah 31:33–36), and there will be a future restoration of Israel (Isaiah 11:12).
                                                                                         Answer
And Jesus’ mention of “this generation” should be taken to mean the generation that is alive to see the beginning of the events described in Matthew 24.
However, full preterism has some serious flaws in that it denies the physical reality of Christ’s second coming and downplays the dreadful nature of the tribulation by restricting that event to the fall of Jerusalem.
                                                                                         Answer

 The word rapture does not occur in the Bible.
The term comes from a Latin word meaning “a carrying off, a transport, or a snatching away.” The concept of the “carrying off” or the rapture of the church is clearly taught in Scripture.
The rapture of the church is the event in which God “snatches away” all believers from the earth in order to make way for His righteous judgment to be poured out on the earth during the tribulation period.
The rapture is described primarily in 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18 and 1 Corinthians 15:50–54.
God will resurrect all believers who have died, give them glorified bodies, and take them from the earth, along with all living believers, who will also be given glorified bodies at that time.
“For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
The rapture will involve an instantaneous transformation of our bodies to fit us for eternity.
For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:51–52).
The rapture of the church is a glorious event we should all be longing for.
The rapture of the church is the event in which God “snatches away” all believers from the earth in order to make way for His righteous judgment to be poured out on the earth during the tribulation period.
“For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
There is far too much debate over the meaning and scope of the rapture.
This is not God’s intent.
Rather, the rapture should be a comforting doctrine full of hope; God wants us to “encourage each other with these words” (1 Thessalonians 4:18).
   Return to:
“For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.

 Fast food restaurants entice us by allowing us to order our food exactly the way we want it.
Some coffee shops boast over a hundred different flavors and varieties of coffee.
Even when buying houses and cars, we can look for one with all the options and features we desire.
We no longer live in just a chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry world.
You can find about anything you want according to your own personal likes and needs.
How about a religion that is guilt-free, makes no demands, and is not encumbered with a lot of bothersome do’s and don’ts?
There are a lot of voices vying for our attention, so why should anyone consider Jesus above, say, Muhammad or Confucius, Buddha, or Charles Taze Russell, or Joseph Smith?
The enemies of Jesus could have easily stopped all talk of the resurrection by producing His dead, decaying body, but there was no dead body for them to produce!
Jesus alone speaks with the authority of God because Jesus alone conquered death.
Muhammad, Confucius, and the others molder in their graves to this very day.
But Jesus, by His own power, walked away from the tomb three days after dying on a cruel Roman cross.
Anyone with power over death deserves our attention.
Anyone with power over death deserves to be heard.
The evidence supporting the resurrection of Jesus is overwhelming.
First, there were over five hundred eye witnesses of the risen Christ!
Five hundred voices cannot be ignored.
Considering His closest followers had fled in fear at His arrest and crucifixion, it is most unlikely this ragtag band of frightened fishermen would have gone head to head against trained, professional soldiers.

Jesus proved His power over death; therefore, we need to hear what He says.

Jesus claims to be the only way to salvation (John 14:6).
He is not a way; He is not one of many ways.
Jesus alone speaks with the authority of God because Jesus alone conquered death.
And this same Jesus says, "Come to me all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).
Jesus claims to be the only way to salvation (John 14:6).

 Questions about Cults and Religions
Jesus is the right "religion" if you are looking for an eternal home in Heaven (John 3:16).
                                                                                         Answer
 Of all the gifts given to mankind by God, there is none greater than the presence of the Holy Spirit.
The Spirit has many functions, roles, and activities.
First, He does a work in the hearts of all people everywhere.
Jesus told the disciples that He would send the Spirit into the world to “convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment” (John 16:7-11).
Everyone has a “God consciousness,” whether or not they admit it.
The Spirit applies the truths of God to minds of men to convince them by fair and sufficient arguments that they are sinners.
Responding to that conviction brings men to salvation.
Once we are saved and belong to God, the Spirit takes up residence in our hearts forever, sealing us with the confirming, certifying, and assuring pledge of our eternal state as His children.
Jesus said He would send the Spirit to us to be our Helper, Comforter, and Guide.
“And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever” (John 14:16).
The Greek word translated here “Counselor” means “one who is called alongside” and has the idea of someone who encourages and exhorts.
The Holy Spirit takes up permanent residence in the hearts of believers (Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 6:19-20, 12:13).
Jesus gave the Spirit as a “compensation” for His absence, to perform the functions toward us which He would have done if He had remained personally with us.
Among those functions is that of revealer of truth.
The Spirit’s presence within us enables us to understand and interpret God’s Word.
Jesus told His disciples that “when He, the Spirit of Truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth” (John 16:13).
The Spirit convinces us of Christ’s deity and incarnation, His being the Messiah, His suffering and death, His resurrection and ascension, His exaltation at the right hand of God, and His role as the judge of all.
He is the ultimate guide, going before, leading the way, removing obstructions, opening the understanding, and making all things plain and clear.
He leads in the way we should go in all spiritual things.
Without such a guide, we would be apt to fall into error.
A crucial part of the truth He reveals is that Jesus is who He said He is (John 15:26; 1 Corinthians 12:3).
The Spirit convinces us of Christ’s deity and incarnation, His being the Messiah, His suffering and death, His resurrection and ascension, His exaltation at the right hand of God, and His role as the judge of all.
He gives glory to Christ in all things (John 16:14).
Another one of the Holy Spirit’s roles is that of gift-giver.
First Corinthians 12 describes the spiritual gifts given to believers in order that we may function as the body of Christ on earth.
All these gifts, both great and small, are given by the Spirit so that we may be His ambassadors to the world, showing forth His grace and glorifying Him.
First Corinthians 12 describes the spiritual gifts given to believers in order that we may function as the body of Christ on earth.
When He indwells us, He begins the work of harvesting His fruit in our lives—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23).
These are not works of our flesh, which is incapable of producing such fruit, but they are products of the Spirit’s presence in our lives.
The knowledge that the Holy Spirit of God has taken up residence in our lives, that He performs all these miraculous functions, that He dwells with us forever, and that He will never leave or forsake us is cause for great joy and comfort.
Thank God for this precious gift—the Holy Spirit and His work in our lives!
 Questions about the Holy Spirit
 What does it mean that the Holy Spirit will convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment?
                                                                                         Answer
 The Romans Road to salvation is a way of explaining the good news of salvation using verses from the Book of Romans.
It is a simple yet powerful method of explaining why we need salvation, how God provided salvation, how we can receive salvation, and what are the results of salvation.
The first verse on the Romans Road to salvation is Romans 3:23, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
We have all done things that are displeasing to God.
We have all sinned.
 The Romans Road to salvation is a way of explaining the good news of salvation using verses from the Book of Romans.
There is no one who is innocent.
Romans 3:10-18 gives a detailed picture of what sin looks like in our lives.
The second Scripture on the Romans Road to salvation, Romans 6:23, teaches us about the consequences of sin - "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
The second Scripture on the Romans Road to salvation, Romans 6:23, teaches us about the consequences of sin - "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
The punishment that we have earned for our sins is death.
Not just physical death, but eternal death!
The third verse on the Romans Road to salvation picks up where Romans 6:23 left off, "but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans 5:8 declares, "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
Jesus’ resurrection proves that God accepted Jesus’ death as the payment for our sins.
The third verse on the Romans Road to salvation picks up where Romans 6:23 left off, "but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
The fourth stop on the Romans Road to salvation is Romans 10:9, "that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."
Because of Jesus’ death on our behalf, all we have to do is believe in Him, trusting His death as the payment for our sins - and we will be saved!
Romans 10:13 says it again, "for everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
Jesus died to pay the penalty for our sins and rescue us from eternal death.
Salvation, the forgiveness of sins, is available to anyone who will trust in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
The final aspect of the Romans Road to salvation is the results of salvation.
Romans 5:1 has this wonderful message, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
Romans 5:1 has this wonderful message, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
Through Jesus Christ we can have a relationship of peace with God.
Romans 8:1 teaches us, "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
Because of Jesus’ death on our behalf, we will never be condemned for our sins.
Romans 5:1 has this wonderful message, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
Finally, we have this precious promise of God from Romans 8:38-39, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

                                                                                         Answer
 The second coming of Jesus Christ is the hope of believers that God is in control of all things, and is faithful to the promises and prophecies in His Word.
In His first coming, Jesus Christ came to earth as a baby in a manger in Bethlehem, just as prophesied.
Jesus fulfilled many of the prophecies of the Messiah during His birth, life, ministry, death, and resurrection.
However, there are some prophecies regarding the Messiah that Jesus has not yet fulfilled.
The second coming of Christ will be the return of Christ to fulfill these remaining prophecies.
As a result of the prophecies seeming to speak of two individuals, many Jewish scholars believed there would be both a suffering Messiah and a conquering Messiah.
In His second coming, Jesus will be the conquering King.
In His first coming, Jesus arrived in the most humble of circumstances.
In His second coming, Jesus will arrive with the armies of heaven at His side.
The Old Testament prophets did not make clearly this distinction between the two comings.
This can be seen in Isaiah 7:14, 9:6-7 and Zechariah 14:4.
As a result of the prophecies seeming to speak of two individuals, many Jewish scholars believed there would be both a suffering Messiah and a conquering Messiah.
What they failed to understand is that there is only one Messiah and He would fulfill both roles.
Jesus fulfilled the role of the suffering servant (Isaiah chapter 53) in His first coming.
Jesus will fulfill the role of Israel’s deliverer and King in His second coming.
Zechariah 12:10 and Revelation 1:7, describing the second coming, look back to Jesus being pierced.
Israel, and the whole world, will mourn for not having accepted the Messiah the first time He came.
This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven’” (Acts 1:11).
Zechariah 14:4 identifies the location of the second coming as the Mount of Olives.
Matthew 24:30 declares, “At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn.
They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.” Titus 2:13 describes the second coming as a “glorious appearing.”
 The second coming is spoken of in greatest detail in Revelation 19:11-16, “I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True.
His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns.
The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean.
Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations.
He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”
 The second coming is spoken of in greatest detail in Revelation 19:11-16, “I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True.

 The sinner’s prayer is a prayer a person prays to God when they understand that they are a sinner and in need of a Savior.
Saying a sinner’s prayer will not accomplish anything on its own.
A true sinner’s prayer only represents what a person knows, understands, and believes about their sinfulness and need for salvation.
The first aspect of a sinner’s prayer is understanding that we are all sinners.
Romans 3:10 proclaims, "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one."
The Bible makes it clear that we have all sinned.
We are all sinners in need of mercy and forgiveness from God (Titus 3:5-7).
Because of our sin, we deserve eternal punishment (Matthew 25:46).
The sinner’s prayer is a plea for grace instead of judgment.
It is a request for mercy instead of wrath.
The second aspect of a sinner’s prayer is knowing what God has done to remedy our lost and sinful condition.
God took on flesh and became a human being in the Person of Jesus Christ (John 1:1,14).
Jesus taught us the truth about God and lived a perfectly righteous and sinless life (John 8:46; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus then died on the cross in our place, taking the punishment that we deserve (Romans 5:8).
Jesus rose from the dead to prove His victory over sin, death, and hell (Colossians 2:15; 1 Corinthians chapter 15).
Because of all of this, we can have our sins forgiven and be promised an eternal home in Heaven - if we will just place our faith in Jesus Christ.
All we have to do is believe that He died in our place and rose from the dead (Romans 10:9-10).
We can be saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone.
Ephesians 2:8 declares, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God."

 The substitutionary atonement refers to Jesus Christ dying as a substitute for sinners.
The Scriptures teach that all men are sinners (Romans 3:9-18, 23).
Romans 6:23 reads, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
Romans 6:23 reads, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
Romans 6:23 reads, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
  That verse teaches us several things.
Without Christ, we are going to die and spend an eternity in hell as payment for our sins.
Death in the Scriptures refers to a “separation.” Everyone will die, but some will live in heaven with the Lord for eternity, while others will live a life in hell for eternity.
Death in the Scriptures refers to a “separation.” Everyone will die, but some will live in heaven with the Lord for eternity, while others will live a life in hell for eternity.
Death in the Scriptures refers to a “separation.” Everyone will die, but some will live in heaven with the Lord for eternity, while others will live a life in hell for eternity.
However, the second thing this verse teaches us is that eternal life is available through Jesus Christ.
This is His substitutionary atonement.
Jesus Christ died in our place when He was crucified on the cross.
We deserved to be the ones placed on that cross to die because we are the ones who live sinful lives.
But Christ took the punishment on Himself in our place—He substituted Himself for us and took what we rightly deserved.
“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21).
One more passage that talks about the substitutionary atonement is Isaiah 53:5.
“He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed” (1 Peter 2:24).
Here again we see that Christ took the sins we committed onto Himself to pay the price for us.
He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit” (1 Peter 3:18).
Not only do these verses teach us about the substitute that Christ was for us, but they also teach that He was the atonement, meaning He satisfied the payment due for the sinfulness of man.
One more passage that talks about the substitutionary atonement is Isaiah 53:5.
This verse talks about the coming Christ who was to die on the cross for our sins.
The prophecy is very detailed, and the crucifixion happened just as it was foretold.
“But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.” Notice the substitution.
The prophecy is very detailed, and the crucifixion happened just as it was foretold.
Here again we see that Christ paid the price for us!
We can only pay the price of sin on our own by being punished and placed in hell for all eternity.
But God’s Son, Jesus Christ, came to earth to pay the price of our sins.
Because He did this for us, we now have the opportunity to not only have our sins forgiven, but to spend eternity with Him.
In order to do this, we must place our faith in what Christ did on the cross.
We cannot save ourselves; we need a substitute to take our place.
The death of Jesus Christ is the substitutionary atonement.

Making Sense of Salvation by Wayne Grudem
                                                                                         Answer
 The tribulation is a future seven-year period of time when God will finish His discipline of Israel and finalize His judgment of the unbelieving world.
The church, made up of all who have trusted in the person and work of the Lord Jesus to save them from being punished for sin, will not be present during the tribulation.
The church will be removed from the earth in an event known as the rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-53).
The church is saved from the wrath to come (1 Thessalonians 5:9).
Throughout Scripture, the tribulation is referred to by other names such as the Day of the Lord (Isaiah 2:12; 13:6-9; Joel 1:15; 2:1-31; 3:14; 1 Thessalonians 5:2); trouble or tribulation (Deuteronomy 4:30; Zephaniah 1:1); the great tribulation, which refers to the more intense second half of the seven-year period (Matthew 24:21); time or day of trouble (Daniel 12:1; Zephaniah 1:15); time of Jacob’s trouble (Jeremiah 30:7).
An understanding of Daniel 9:24-27 is necessary in order to understand the purpose and time of the tribulation.
This passage speaks of 70 weeks that have been declared against “your people.” Daniel’s people are the Jews, the nation of Israel, and Daniel 9:24 speaks of a period of time that God has given “to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.” God declares that “seventy sevens” will fulfill all these things.

In verses 25 and 26, Daniel is told that the Messiah will be cut off after “seven sevens and sixty-two sevens” (69 total), beginning with the decree to rebuild Jerusalem.
This is 70 sevens of years, or 490 years.
(Some translations refer to 70 weeks of years.)
This is confirmed by another part of this passage in Daniel.
In verses 25 and 26, Daniel is told that the Messiah will be cut off after “seven sevens and sixty-two sevens” (69 total), beginning with the decree to rebuild Jerusalem.
In other words, 69 sevens of years (483 years) after the decree to rebuild Jerusalem, the Messiah will be cut off.
Biblical historians confirm that 483 years passed from the time of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the time when Jesus was crucified.
Most Christian scholars, regardless of their view of eschatology (future things/events), have the above understanding of Daniel’s 70 sevens.
With 483 years having passed from the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the cutting off of the Messiah, this leaves one seven-year period to be fulfilled in terms of Daniel 9:24: “to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.” This final seven-year period is known as the tribulation period—it is a time when God finishes judging Israel for its sin.

Daniel 9:27 says that the beast will make a covenant for seven years, but in the middle of this week (3 1/2 years into the tribulation), he will break the covenant, putting a stop to sacrifice.
And on a wing of the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.” The person of whom this verse speaks is the person Jesus calls the “abomination that causes desolation” (Matthew 24:15) and is called “the beast” in Revelation 13.
Daniel 9:27 says that the beast will make a covenant for seven years, but in the middle of this week (3 1/2 years into the tribulation), he will break the covenant, putting a stop to sacrifice.
Revelation 13 explains that the beast will place an image of himself in the temple and require the world to worship him.
Revelation 13:5 says that this will go on for 42 months, which is 3 1/2 years.
Since Daniel 9:27 says that this will happen in the middle of the week, and Revelation 13:5 says that the beast will do this for a period of 42 months, it is easy to see that the total length of time is 84 months or seven years.
Also see Daniel 7:25, where the “time, times, and half a time” (time=1 year; times=2 years; half a time=1/2 year; total of 3 1/2 years) also refers to “great tribulation,” the last half of the seven-year tribulation period when the beast will be in power.
For further references about the tribulation, see Revelation 11:2-3, which speaks of 1260 days and 42 months, and Daniel 12:11-12, which speaks of 1290 days and 1335 days.
These days have a reference to the midpoint of the tribulation.
The additional days in Daniel 12 may include the time at the end for the judgment of the nations (Matthew 25:31-46) and time for the setting up of Christ’s millennial kingdom (Revelation 20:4-6).

 Matthew 24:5–8 gives us some important clues for discerning the approach of the end times: “Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many.
In this passage, though, we are given a warning: we are not to be deceived, because these events are only the beginning of birth pains; the end is still to come.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
All these are the beginning of birth pains.” An increase in false messiahs, an increase in warfare, and increases in famines, plagues, and natural disasters—these are signs of the end times.
In this passage, though, we are given a warning: we are not to be deceived, because these events are only the beginning of birth pains; the end is still to come.
Some interpreters point to every earthquake, every political upheaval, and every attack on Israel as a sure sign that the end times are rapidly approaching.
While the events may signal the approach of the last days, they are not necessarily indicators that the end times have arrived.
The apostle Paul warned that the last days would bring a marked increase in false teaching.
“The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons” (1 Timothy 4:1).
The last days are described as “perilous times” because of the increasingly evil character of man and people who actively “oppose the truth” (2 Timothy 3:1–9; see also 2 Thessalonians 2:3).
Other possible signs would include a rebuilding of a Jewish temple in Jerusalem, increased hostility toward Israel, and advances toward a one-world government.
The most prominent sign of the end times, however, is the nation of Israel.
In 1948, Israel was recognized as a sovereign state, essentially for the first time since AD 70.
God promised Abraham that his posterity would have Canaan as “an everlasting possession” (Genesis 17:8), and Ezekiel prophesied a physical and spiritual resuscitation of Israel (Ezekiel 37).
Having Israel as a nation in its own land is important in light of end-times prophecy because of Israel’s prominence in eschatology (Daniel 10:14; 11:41; Revelation 11:8).
With these signs in mind, we can be wise and discerning in regard to the expectation of the end times.
We should not, however, interpret any of these singular events as a clear indication of the soon arrival of the end times.
God has given us enough information that we can be prepared, and that is what we are called to be as our hearts cry out, “Come, Lord Jesus” (Revelation 22:20).

 The apostle Paul clearly taught that we receive the Holy Spirit the moment we receive Jesus Christ as our Savior.
First Corinthians 12:13 declares, “For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.” Romans 8:9 tells us that if a person does not possess the Holy Spirit, he or she does not belong to Christ: “You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you.
Paul could not say that we all were baptized by one Spirit and all given one Spirit to drink if not all of the Corinthian believers possessed the Holy Spirit.
First Corinthians 12:13 declares, “For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.” Romans 8:9 tells us that if a person does not possess the Holy Spirit, he or she does not belong to Christ: “You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you.
Romans 8:9 is even stronger, stating that if a person does not have the Spirit, he does not belong to Christ.
And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.” Ephesians 1:13-14 teaches us that the Holy Spirit is the seal of salvation for all those who believe: “Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.”
And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.” Ephesians 1:13-14 teaches us that the Holy Spirit is the seal of salvation for all those who believe: “Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.”
  These three passages make it clear that the Holy Spirit is received at the moment of salvation.
Paul could not say that we all were baptized by one Spirit and all given one Spirit to drink if not all of the Corinthian believers possessed the Holy Spirit.
Romans 8:9 is even stronger, stating that if a person does not have the Spirit, he does not belong to Christ.
Therefore, the possession of the Spirit is an identifying factor of the possession of salvation.
Further, the Holy Spirit could not be the “seal of salvation” (Ephesians 1:13-14) if He is not received at the moment of salvation.
Many scriptures make it abundantly clear that our salvation is secured the moment we receive Christ as Savior.
This discussion is controversial because the ministries of the Holy Spirit are often confused.
The receiving/indwelling of the Spirit occurs at the moment of salvation.
The filling of the Spirit is an ongoing process in the Christian life.
While we hold that the baptism of the Spirit also occurs at the moment of salvation, some Christians do not.
This sometimes results in the baptism of the Spirit being confused with “receiving the Spirit” as an act subsequent to salvation.
We receive the Holy Spirit by simply receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior (John 3:5-16).
The Holy Spirit becomes our permanent possession the moment we believe.
 Questions about the Holy Spirit
 Why had the believers in Samaria not received the Holy Spirit (Acts 8)?
                                                                                         Answer
 The timing of the rapture in relation to the tribulation is one of the most controversial issues in the church today.
The three primary views are pre-tribulational (the rapture occurs before the tribulation), mid-tribulational (the rapture occurs at or near the mid-point of the tribulation), and post-tribulational (the rapture occurs at the end of the tribulation).
A fourth view, commonly known as pre-wrath, is a slight modification of the mid-tribulational position.
First, it is important to recognize the purpose of the tribulation.
According to Daniel 9:27, there is a seventieth “seven” (seven years) that is still yet to come.
Daniel’s entire prophecy of the seventy sevens (Daniel 9:20-27) is speaking of the nation of Israel.
It is a time period in which God focuses His attention especially on Israel.
The seventieth seven, the tribulation, must also be a time when God deals specifically with Israel.
While this does not necessarily indicate that the church could not also be present, it does bring into question why the church would need to be on the earth during that time.
The primary Scripture passage on the rapture is 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18.
It states that all living believers, along with all believers who have died, will meet the Lord Jesus in the air and will be with Him forever.
The fact that God promises to deliver Christians from wrath shortly after promising to remove His people from the earth seems to link those two events together.
A few verses later, in 1 Thessalonians 5:9, Paul says, “For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.” The book of Revelation, which deals primarily with the time period of the tribulation, is a prophetic message of how God will pour out His wrath upon the earth during the tribulation.
A few verses later, in 1 Thessalonians 5:9, Paul says, “For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.” The book of Revelation, which deals primarily with the time period of the tribulation, is a prophetic message of how God will pour out His wrath upon the earth during the tribulation.
It seems inconsistent for God to promise believers that they will not suffer wrath and then leave them on the earth to suffer through the wrath of the tribulation.
The fact that God promises to deliver Christians from wrath shortly after promising to remove His people from the earth seems to link those two events together.
Another crucial passage on the timing of the rapture is Revelation 3:10, in which Christ promises to deliver believers from the “hour of trial” that is going to come upon the earth.
This could mean two things.
Christ is promising to keep believers from the very time period that contains the trials, namely the tribulation.
Both are valid meanings of the Greek word translated “from.” However, it is important to recognize what believers are promised to be kept from.

It is not just the trial, but the “hour” of trial.
Christ is promising to keep believers from the very time period that contains the trials, namely the tribulation.
The purpose of the tribulation, the purpose of the rapture, the meaning of 1 Thessalonians 5:9, and the interpretation of Revelation 3:10 all give clear support to the pre-tribulational position.
If the Bible is interpreted literally and consistently, the pre-tribulational position is the most biblically-based interpretation.

 There are many Old Testament prophecies about Jesus Christ.
Regarding Jesus’ birth—Isaiah 7:14: “Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.” Isaiah 9:6: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.
And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” Micah 5:2: “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.”
Isaiah 53:3-7 is especially unmistakable: “He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.

See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.” Psalm 22:16-18: “Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet.
I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me.
Some interpreters place the number of Messianic prophecies in the hundreds.
Isaiah 53:3-7 is especially unmistakable: “He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.

Isaiah 53:3-7 is especially unmistakable: “He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.
 The “seventy sevens” prophecy in Daniel chapter 9 predicted the precise date that Jesus, the Messiah, would be “cut off.” Isaiah 50:6 accurately describes the beating that Jesus endured.

 The Bible is absolutely clear that, ultimately, there are only two options for where you go when you die: heaven or hell.
Our sin separates us from God, and, if left unresolved, our sin will result in us being eternally separated from God (Matthew 25:46; Romans 6:23a).
God now offers us salvation and forgiveness as a gift (Romans 6:23b) that we must receive by faith (John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8–9).
We have all sinned (Romans 3:23).
God invites you to come to Him.
If God is lifting the veil and removing your spiritual blindness (2 Corinthians 4:4), look to the Savior.
Receive Jesus Christ as your Savior, and heaven will be your eternal destination.
Make any other decision, and eternal separation from God in hell will be the result (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).
As an act of faith, communicate the following to God: “God, I know that I am a sinner, and I know that because of my sin I deserve to be eternally separated from you.

To better explain, here is a paraphrase of 1 Peter 3:18–20: “Jesus was put to death in the flesh, but He was made alive in the Spirit (it was through this same Spirit that Jesus long ago preached to those who are right now in prison—those souls who disobeyed during the time of God’s great patience when Noah was building the ark).” According to this view, Jesus preached spiritually to the people of Noah’s time, and He did this through the prophet Noah, in much the same way that God speaks through us today when we proclaim God’s Word.
First Peter 3:18–20 says, “Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared” (ESV).

Russell named his group the “Millennial Dawn Bible Study,” and those who followed him were called “Bible students.” Charles T. Russell began writing a series of books he called “The Millennial Dawn,” which stretched to six volumes before his death and contained much of the theology Jehovah’s Witnesses now hold.
This contradicts countless scriptures which declare salvation to be received by grace through faith (John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5).
The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society altered the text of the Bible to make it fit their false doctrine, rather than basing their doctrine on what the Bible actually teaches.
May God open the eyes of the Jehovah’s Witnesses to the truth of the gospel and the true teaching of God’s Word.
Jehovah’s Witnesses reject the concept of Christ’s substitutionary atonement and instead hold to a ransom theory, that Jesus’ death was a ransom payment for Adam’s sin.

 Jesus clearly taught in John 3:16 that He will save anyone who believes in Him: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” This “whoever” includes you and every other person in the world.

Ephesians 2:8–9 teaches, “It is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.” We are saved by God’s grace, and grace, by definition, cannot be earned.

But Paul tells them that, upon salvation, “You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (1 Corinthians 6:9–11).
We must respond in faith and receive His free gift of eternal life.

Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst” (1 Timothy 1:13–15).
He saved a thief on a cross with only minutes to live (Luke 23:42–43), a persecutor of the church (Paul), a fisherman who had denied Him (Peter), a Roman soldier and his family (Acts 10), a runaway slave (Onesimus in Philemon), and many others.
If you are not certain you have accepted Jesus as your Savior, you can respond right now with a prayer similar to this:

 A common argument from atheists and skeptics is that if all things need a cause, then God must also need a cause.
The conclusion is that if God needed a cause, then God is not God (and if God is not God, then of course there is no God).
This is a slightly more sophisticated form of the basic question “Who made God?” Everyone knows that something does not come from nothing.
This is a slightly more sophisticated form of the basic question “Who made God?” Everyone knows that something does not come from nothing.
So, if God is a “something,” then He must have a cause, right?
The question is tricky because it sneaks in the false assumption that God came from somewhere and then asks where that might be.
The answer is that the question does not even make sense.
It is like asking, “What does blue smell like?” Blue is not in the category of things that have a smell, so the question itself is flawed.
It is like asking, “What does blue smell like?” Blue is not in the category of things that have a smell, so the question itself is flawed.
In the same way, God is not in the category of things that are created or caused.
God is uncaused and uncreated—He simply exists.
We know that from nothing, nothing comes.
So, if there were ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence, then nothing would have ever come into existence.
But things do exist.
So, if there were ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence, then nothing would have ever come into existence.
That ever-existing thing is what we call God.
God is the uncaused Being that caused everything else to come into existence.
God is the uncreated Creator who created the universe and everything in it.

I Don’t Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist by Norm Geisler and Frank Turek
                                                                                         Answer
 Unlike the question “Does God exist?” the question of whether Jesus Christ existed is asked by relatively few people.
Most accept that Jesus was truly a man who lived in Israel 2,000 years ago.
The debate begins with the discussion of Jesus’ full identity.
Almost every major religion teaches that Jesus was a prophet or a good teacher or a godly man.
S. Lewis in his book Mere Christianity writes the following: “I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him [Jesus Christ]: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God.’ That is the one thing we must not say.
He has not left that option open to us.
A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.
He would either be a lunatic—on a level with a man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of hell.
You must make your choice.
Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse.
He never says, “I did not claim to be God.” When Jesus said, “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30), He truly was claiming equality with God.
But the Bible tells us that Jesus was infinitely more than a prophet, a good teacher, or a godly man.
He has not left that option open to us.
He has not left that option open to us.

The fact that Cain was scared for his own life after he killed Abel (Genesis 4:14) indicates that there were likely many other children and perhaps even grandchildren of Adam and Eve already living at that time.
Adam and Eve did not have any genetic defects, and that enabled them and the first few generations of their descendants to have a far greater quality of health than we do now.
                                                                                         Answer
The reason that incest today often results in genetic abnormalities is that when two people of similar genetics (i.e., a brother and sister) have children together, there is a high risk of their recessive characteristics becoming dominant.
                                                                                         Answer
 Genesis 6:1-4 refers to the sons of God and the daughters of men.
There have been several suggestions as to who the sons of God were and why the children they had with daughters of men grew into a race of giants (that is what the word Nephilim seems to indicate).
The three primary views on the identity of the sons of God are 1) they were fallen angels, 2) they were powerful human rulers, or 3) they were godly descendants of Seth intermarrying with wicked descendants of Cain.
Giving weight to the first theory is the fact that in the Old Testament the phrase “sons of God” always refers to angels (Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7).
A potential problem with this is in Matthew 22:30, which indicates that angels do not marry.
As previously noted, the weakness of the first view is that Matthew 22:30 declares, “At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” However, the text does not say “angels are not able to marry.” Rather, it indicates only that angels do not marry.
The other two views do not present this problem.
The weakness of views 2) and 3) is that ordinary human males marrying ordinary human females does not account for why the offspring were “giants” or “heroes of old, men of renown.” Further, why would God decide to bring the flood on the earth (Genesis 6:5-7) when God had never forbidden powerful human males or descendants of Seth to marry ordinary human females or descendants of Cain?
The weakness of views 2) and 3) is that ordinary human males marrying ordinary human females does not account for why the offspring were “giants” or “heroes of old, men of renown.” Further, why would God decide to bring the flood on the earth (Genesis 6:5-7) when God had never forbidden powerful human males or descendants of Seth to marry ordinary human females or descendants of Cain?
Only the obscene, perverse marriage of fallen angels with human females would seem to justify such a harsh judgment.
As previously noted, the weakness of the first view is that Matthew 22:30 declares, “At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” However, the text does not say “angels are not able to marry.” Rather, it indicates only that angels do not marry.

The fact that God’s holy angels do not marry or engage in sexual relations does not mean the same is true of Satan and his demons.
Second, Matthew 22:30 is referring to the “angels in heaven.” It is not referring to fallen angels, who do not care about God’s created order and actively seek ways to disrupt God’s plan.
The fact that God’s holy angels do not marry or engage in sexual relations does not mean the same is true of Satan and his demons.
The fact that God’s holy angels do not marry or engage in sexual relations does not mean the same is true of Satan and his demons.
However, while angels are spiritual beings (Hebrews 1:14), they can appear in human, physical form (Mark 16:5).
Yes, it is an interesting “contradiction” to say that angels are sexless and then to say that the “sons of God” were fallen angels who procreated with human females.
However, while angels are spiritual beings (Hebrews 1:14), they can appear in human, physical form (Mark 16:5).
The men of Sodom and Gomorrah wanted to have sex with the two angels who were with Lot (Genesis 19:1-5).
It is plausible that angels are capable of taking on human form, even to the point of replicating human sexuality and possibly even reproduction.
It seems that God imprisoned the fallen angels who committed this evil sin, so that the other fallen angels would not do the same (as described in Jude 6).
Earlier Hebrew interpreters and apocryphal and pseudopigraphal writings are unanimous in holding to the view that fallen angels are the “sons of God” mentioned in Genesis 6:1-4.
This by no means closes the debate.
However, the view that Genesis 6:1-4 involves fallen angels mating with human females has a strong contextual, grammatical, and historical basis.

 People’s beliefs concerning Satan range from the silly to the abstract—from a little red guy with horns who sits on your shoulder urging you to sin, to an expression used to describe the personification of evil.
The Bible, however, gives us a clear portrait of who Satan is and how he affects our lives.
Put simply, the Bible defines Satan as an angelic being who fell from his position in heaven due to sin and is now completely opposed to God, doing all in his power to thwart God’s purposes.
Satan was created as a holy angel.
Isaiah 14:12 possibly gives Satan’s pre-fall name as Lucifer.
Ezekiel 28:12-14 describes Satan as having been created a cherub, apparently the highest created angel.
He became arrogant in his beauty and status and decided he wanted to sit on a throne above that of God (Isaiah 14:13-14; Ezekiel 28:15; 1 Timothy 3:6).
Satan’s pride led to his fall.
He became arrogant in his beauty and status and decided he wanted to sit on a throne above that of God (Isaiah 14:13-14; Ezekiel 28:15; 1 Timothy 3:6).
Because of his sin, God permanently removed Satan from his exalted position and role.
Satan became the ruler of this world and the prince of the power of the air (John 12:31; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Ephesians 2:2).
He is an accuser (Revelation 12:10), a tempter (Matthew 4:3; 1 Thessalonians 3:5), and a deceiver (Genesis 3; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Revelation 20:3).
His very name means “adversary” or “one who opposes.” Another of his titles, the devil, means “slanderer.”
His very name means “adversary” or “one who opposes.” Another of his titles, the devil, means “slanderer.”
 Even though he was cast out of heaven, he still seeks to elevate his throne above God.

 God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden to give Adam and Eve a choice to obey Him or disobey Him.
God created Adam and Eve to be “free” beings, able to make decisions, able to choose between good and evil.
Eating the fruit, as an act of disobedience against God, was what gave Adam and Eve the knowledge of evil—and the knowledge of their nakedness (Genesis 3:6–7).
Genesis 2:16-17, “And the LORD God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.’” If God had not given Adam and Eve the choice, they would have essentially been robots, simply doing what they were programmed to do.
Through faith in Christ, we can be free from sin’s consequences, and ultimately free from sin itself.

His suffering was physical: Isaiah 52:14 declares, “There were many who were appalled at Him—His appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness.” His suffering was emotional: “All the disciples deserted him and fled” (Matthew 26:56).
Jesus’ brutal physical suffering was augmented by His having to bear the guilt of our sins and die to pay our penalty (Romans 5:8).

Psalm 22:14–18 details some of the suffering of the Messiah: “I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.
Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet.

My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.
Jesus suffered and died in order to secure salvation for all who would believe.
The principle of the innocent dying for the guilty was established in the garden of Eden: Adam and Eve received garments of animal skin to cover their shame (Genesis 3:21)—thus, blood was shed in Eden.
Jesus had to suffer because suffering is part of sacrifice, and Jesus was “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29).

 It is somewhat of a mystery why people in early chapters of Genesis lived such long lives.
The genealogy in Genesis 5 records the line of the godly descendants of Seth—the line that would eventually produce the Messiah.
The genealogy in Genesis 5 records the line of the godly descendants of Seth—the line that would eventually produce the Messiah.
God possibly blessed this line with especially long life as a result of their godliness and obedience.
While this is a possible explanation, the Bible nowhere specifically limits the long lifespans to the individuals mentioned in Genesis chapter 5.
Further, other than Enoch, Genesis 5 does not identify any of the individuals as being especially godly.
It is likely that everyone during that time lived several hundred years.
Several factors may have contributed to this.
According to the canopy theory, the water “above the firmament” (Genesis 1:7, KJV) created a greenhouse effect and blocked much of the radiation that now hits the earth, resulting in ideal living conditions.
According to the canopy theory, the water “above the firmament” (Genesis 1:7, KJV) created a greenhouse effect and blocked much of the radiation that now hits the earth, resulting in ideal living conditions.
One theory for why the people of Genesis lived such long lives is based on the idea that a canopy of water used to surround the earth.
At the time of the flood, the water canopy was poured out on the earth (Genesis 7:11), ending the ideal environment.
Compare the lifespans before the flood (Genesis 5:1–32) with those after the flood (Genesis 11:10–32).
According to the canopy theory, the water “above the firmament” (Genesis 1:7, KJV) created a greenhouse effect and blocked much of the radiation that now hits the earth, resulting in ideal living conditions.
Another consideration is that, in the first few generations after creation, the human genetic code had developed few defects.
Adam and Eve were created perfect.
One theory for why the people of Genesis lived such long lives is based on the idea that a canopy of water used to surround the earth.
Their descendants would have inherited these advantages, albeit to lesser degrees.
Over time, as a result of sin, the human genetic code became increasingly corrupted, and human beings became more and more susceptible to death and disease.

There is no one who is not affected by the harsh realities of life, and the question “why do bad things happen to good people?” is one of the most difficult questions in all of theology.
At the outset, we must acknowledge that human beings, who are not eternal, infinite, or omniscient, cannot expect to fully understand God’s purposes and ways.
At the outset, we must acknowledge that human beings, who are not eternal, infinite, or omniscient, cannot expect to fully understand God’s purposes and ways.
The book of Job deals with the issue of why God allows bad things to happen to good people.
“Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him” (Job 13:15).
“The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised” (Job 1:21).
Job did not understand why God had allowed the things He did, but he knew God was good and therefore continued to trust in Him.
Ultimately, that should be our reaction as well.

At the outset, we must acknowledge that human beings, who are not eternal, infinite, or omniscient, cannot expect to fully understand God’s purposes and ways.
For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ” (2 Corinthians 1:3–5).
1) Bad things may happen to good people in this world, but this world is not the end.
At the outset, we must acknowledge that human beings, who are not eternal, infinite, or omniscient, cannot expect to fully understand God’s purposes and ways.
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
The book of Job deals with the issue of why God allows bad things to happen to good people.
Romans 5:8 declares, “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Despite the sinful nature of the people of this world, God still loves us.
Romans 5:8 declares, “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Despite the sinful nature of the people of this world, God still loves us.
Jesus loved us enough to die to take the penalty for our sins (Romans 6:23).
If we receive Jesus Christ as Savior (John 3:16; Romans 10:9), we will be forgiven and promised an eternal home in heaven (Romans 8:1).
We live in a fallen world, and we experience the effects of the fall.
God’s Purposes in a World Gone Bad by Paul Enns
Often, bad things happen to us that we simply cannot understand.
God is sovereign, so all that happens must have at least been allowed by Him, if not directly caused by Him.
Whether or not we understand His reasons, we must remember that God is good, just, loving, and merciful (Psalm 135:3).
At the outset, we must acknowledge that human beings, who are not eternal, infinite, or omniscient, cannot expect to fully understand God’s purposes and ways.
Instead of doubting God’s goodness, our reaction should be to trust Him.
For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ” (2 Corinthians 1:3–5).

 Why does God allow earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, tsunamis, typhoons, cyclones, mudslides, wildfires, and other natural disasters?
Numbers 16:30-34 shows us that God sometimes causes natural disasters as a judgment against sin.
For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.” The fall of humanity into sin had effects on everything, including the world we inhabit.

Further, there are significantly more non-Arab Muslims in areas such as Indonesia and Malaysia than there are Arab Muslims.

After World War II, when the United Nations gave a portion of the land of Israel to the Jewish people, the land was ruled by the British and primarily inhabited by Arabs (although one third of the population was Jewish).
The tensions have been stoked by political rhetoric and the existence of groups such as Hamas with their continuing obsession with wiping out “the Zionist entity” and “reversing the results of 1948.”

Church is the place where believers can love one another (1 John 4:12), encourage one another (Hebrews 3:13), “spur” one another to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), serve one another (Galatians 5:13), instruct one another (Romans 15:14), honor one another (Romans 12:10), and be kind and compassionate to one another (Ephesians 4:32).

When a person trusts Jesus Christ for salvation, he or she is made a member of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27).
For a church body to function properly, all of its “body parts” need to be present and working (1 Corinthians 12:14–20).
A believer will never reach full spiritual maturity without having that outlet for his gifts, and we all need the assistance and encouragement of other believers (1 Corinthians 12:21–26).
For these reasons and more, church attendance, participation, and fellowship should be regular aspects of a believer’s life.
Weekly church attendance is in no sense “required” for believers, but someone who belongs to Christ should have a desire to worship God, receive His Word, and fellowship with other believers.
                                                                                         Answer

Its use in Exodus 20:5 to describe God is different from how it is used to describe the sin of jealousy (Galatians 5:20).
Exodus 20:4-5 says, “You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
Another example would be that one person might be jealous or envious of another because of his or her beauty.
In these verses, God is speaking of people making idols and bowing down and worshiping those idols instead of giving God the worship that belongs to Him alone.
This is precisely the jealousy the apostle Paul described in 2 Corinthians 11:2, “I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy...”
                                                                                         Answer

 At the very heart of this question lies a fundamental misunderstanding of what both the Old and New Testaments reveal about the nature of God.
Another way of expressing this same basic thought is when people say, “The God of the Old Testament is a God of wrath while the God of the New Testament is a God of love.” The fact that the Bible is God’s progressive revelation of Himself to us through historical events and through His relationship with people throughout history might contribute to misconceptions about what God is like in the Old Testament as compared to the New Testament.

However, when one reads both the Old and the New Testaments, it becomes evident that God is not different from one testament to another and that God’s wrath and His love are revealed in both testaments.
For example, throughout the Old Testament, God is declared to be a “compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,” (Exodus 34:6; Numbers 14:18; Deuteronomy 4:31; Nehemiah 9:17; Psalm 86:5, 15; 108:4; 145:8; Joel 2:13).
Yet in the New Testament, God’s loving-kindness and mercy are manifested even more fully through the fact that “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
When they willfully sinned against Him and began to worship idols, God would chastise them.
Yet, each time He would deliver them once they had repented of their idolatry.
This is much the same way God deals with Christians in the New Testament.
For example, Hebrews 12:6 tells us that “the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”
 In a similar way, throughout the Old Testament we see God’s judgment and wrath poured out on sin.
Likewise, in the New Testament we see that the wrath of God is still “being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness” (Romans 1:18).
This is much the same way God deals with Christians in the New Testament.
For example, Hebrews 12:6 tells us that “the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”
While we might see one aspect of His nature revealed in certain passages of Scripture more than other aspects, God Himself does not change.
As we read and study the Bible, it becomes clear that God is the same in the Old and New Testaments.
Even though the Bible is 66 individual books written on two (or possibly three) continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years by more than 40 authors, it remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction.
In it we see how a loving, merciful, and just God deals with sinful men in all kinds of situations.
Truly, the Bible is God’s love letter to mankind.
Truly, the Bible is God’s love letter to mankind.
Throughout the Bible we see God lovingly and mercifully calling people into a special relationship with Himself, not because they deserve it, but because He is a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.
Yet we also see a holy and righteous God who is the Judge of all those who disobey His Word and refuse to worship Him, turning instead to worship gods of their own creation (Romans chapter 1).
We see this wonderful truth in verses like 1 John 4:10: “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.” In the Old Testament, God provided a sacrificial system whereby atonement could be made for sin.
Because of God’s righteous and holy character, all sin—past, present, and future—must be judged.
Yet God in His infinite love has provided a payment for sin and a way of reconciliation so that sinful man can escape His wrath.
We see this wonderful truth in verses like 1 John 4:10: “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.” In the Old Testament, God provided a sacrificial system whereby atonement could be made for sin.
Only envisioned in the Old Testament, the ultimate expression of God’s love, the sending of His Son Jesus Christ, is revealed in all its glory in the New Testament.
However, this sacrificial system was only temporary and merely looked forward to the coming of Jesus Christ who would die on the cross to make a complete substitutionary atonement for sin.
The Savior who was promised in the Old Testament is fully revealed in the New Testament.
Only envisioned in the Old Testament, the ultimate expression of God’s love, the sending of His Son Jesus Christ, is revealed in all its glory in the New Testament.
Both the Old and the New Testaments were given “to make us wise unto salvation” (2 Timothy 3:15).
When we study the Testaments closely, it is evident that God “does not change like shifting shadows” (James 1:17).

 The doctrine of the virgin birth is crucially important (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:27, 34).
First, let’s look at how Scripture describes the event.
In response to Mary’s question, “How will this be?” (Luke 1:34), Gabriel says, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you” (Luke 1:35).
Matthew states that the virgin “was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 1:18).
Galatians 4:4 also teaches the Virgin Birth: “God sent His Son, born of a woman.”
Matthew states that the virgin “was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 1:18).
 From these passages, it is certainly clear that Jesus’ birth was the result of the Holy Spirit working within Mary’s body.
The immaterial (the Spirit) and the material (Mary’s womb) were both involved.
Mary, of course, could not impregnate herself, and in that sense she was simply a “vessel.” Only God could perform the miracle of the Incarnation.
Mary, of course, could not impregnate herself, and in that sense she was simply a “vessel.” Only God could perform the miracle of the Incarnation.
However, denying a physical connection between Mary and Jesus would imply that Jesus was not truly human.
Scripture teaches that Jesus was fully human, with a physical body like ours.
This He received from Mary.
At the same time, Jesus was fully God, with an eternal, sinless nature (John 1:14; 1 Timothy 3:16; Hebrews 2:14-17.)
This He received from Mary.
Jesus was not born in sin; that is, He had no sin nature (Hebrews 7:26).
It would seem that the sin nature is passed down from generation to generation through the father (Romans 5:12, 17, 19).
The Virgin Birth circumvented the transmission of the sin nature and allowed the eternal God to become a perfect man.

 For the Christian, praying is supposed to be like breathing, easier to do than to not do.
We pray for a variety of reasons.
For one thing, prayer is a form of serving God (Luke 2:36-38) and obeying Him.
We pray because God commands us to pray (Philippians 4:6-7).
Prayer is exemplified for us by Christ and the early church (Mark 1:35; Acts 1:14; 2:42; 3:1; 4:23-31; 6:4; 13:1-3).
If Jesus thought it was worthwhile to pray, we should also.
If Jesus thought it was worthwhile to pray, we should also.
Another reason to pray is that God intends prayer to be the means of obtaining His solutions in a number of situations.
We pray in preparation for major decisions (Luke 6:12-13); to overcome demonic barriers (Matthew 17:14-21); to gather workers for the spiritual harvest (Luke 10:2); to gain strength to overcome temptation (Matthew 26:41); and to obtain the means of strengthening others spiritually (Ephesians 6:18-19).
We come to God with our specific requests, and we have God’s promise that our prayers are not in vain, even if we do not receive specifically what we asked for (Matthew 6:6; Romans 8:26-27).
He has promised that when we ask for things that are in accordance with His will, He will give us what we ask for (1 John 5:14-15).
Sometimes He delays His answers according to His wisdom and for our benefit.
In these situations, we are to be diligent and persistent in prayer (Matthew 7:7; Luke 18:1-8).
Prayer should not be seen as our means of getting God to do our will on earth, but rather as a means of getting God’s will done on earth.
God’s wisdom far exceeds our own.
For situations in which we do not know God’s will specifically, prayer is a means of discerning His will.
If the blind man outside Jericho had not called out to Christ, he would have remained blind (Luke 18:35-43).
If the blind man outside Jericho had not called out to Christ, he would have remained blind (Luke 18:35-43).
God has said that we often go without because we do not ask (James 4:2).
In one sense, prayer is like sharing the gospel with people.
We do not know who will respond to the message of the gospel until we share it.
In the same way, we will never see the results of answered prayer unless we pray.
A lack of prayer demonstrates a lack of faith and a lack of trust in God’s Word.
We pray to demonstrate our faith in God, that He will do as He has promised in His Word and bless our lives abundantly more than we could ask or hope for (Ephesians 3:20).
Prayer is our primary means of seeing God work in others' lives.
Because it is our means of “plugging into” God’s power, it is our means of defeating Satan and his army that we are powerless to overcome by ourselves.
Therefore, may God find us often before His throne, for we have a high priest in heaven who can identify with all that we go through (Hebrews 4:15-16).
We have His promise that the fervent prayer of a righteous man accomplishes much (James 5:16-18).
May God glorify His name in our lives as we believe in Him enough to come to Him often in prayer.

The Prayer That Turns the World Upside Down: The Lord’s Prayer as a Manifesto for Revolution by R. Albert Mohler Jr.

 It is a fairly well-established fact that Jesus Christ was publicly executed in Judea in the 1st Century A.D., under Pontius Pilate, by means of crucifixion, at the behest of the Jewish Sanhedrin.
The late jurisprudential prodigy and international statesman Sir Lionel Luckhoo (of The Guinness Book of World Records fame for his unprecedented 245 consecutive defense murder trial acquittals) epitomized Christian enthusiasm and confidence in the strength of the case for the resurrection when he wrote, “I have spent more than 42 years as a defense trial lawyer appearing in many parts of the world and am still in active practice.
If an alleged historical event defies natural explanation (e.g., a miraculous resurrection), secular scholars generally treat it with overwhelming skepticism, regardless of the evidence, no matter how favorable and compelling it may be.
There is no good reason to believe that Jesus Christ (or any other man for that matter) could survive such an ordeal, fake His death, sit in a tomb for three days and nights without medical attention, food or water, remove the massive stone which sealed His tomb, escape undetected (without leaving behind a trail of blood), convince hundreds of eyewitnesses that He was resurrected from the death and in good health, and then disappear without a trace.
 Having said that, let us now examine several lines of evidence for Christ’s resurrection.
According to the historical record (The Book of Acts 4:1-17; Pliny’s Letters to Trajan X, 97, etc) most Christians could end their suffering simply by renouncing the faith.
There is no good reason to believe that Jesus Christ (or any other man for that matter) could survive such an ordeal, fake His death, sit in a tomb for three days and nights without medical attention, food or water, remove the massive stone which sealed His tomb, escape undetected (without leaving behind a trail of blood), convince hundreds of eyewitnesses that He was resurrected from the death and in good health, and then disappear without a trace.
While the September 11, 2001, suicide hijackers undoubtedly believed what they professed (as evidenced by their willingness to die for it), they could not and did not know if it was true.
Immediately following His crucifixion, they hid in fear for their lives.
Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.
Like Paul, James willingly suffered and died for his testimony, a fact which attests to the sincerity of his belief (see The Book of Acts and Josephus’ Antiquities of the Jews XX, ix, 1).
 These lines of evidence: the demonstrable sincerity of the eyewitnesses (and in the Apostles’ case, compelling, inexplicable change), the conversion and demonstrable sincerity of key antagonists- and skeptics-turned-martyrs, the fact of the empty tomb, enemy attestation to the empty tomb, the fact that all of this took place in Jerusalem where faith in the resurrection began and thrived, the testimony of the women, the significance of such testimony given the historical context; all of these strongly attest to the historicity of the resurrection.
The first generation of Christians were absolutely brutalized, especially following the conflagration in Rome in A.D. 64 (a fire which Nero allegedly ordered to make room for the expansion of his palace, but which he blamed on the Christians in Rome in an effort to exculpate himself).
Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.
Instead, we have multiple accounts of post-resurrection appearances and hundreds of eyewitnesses willing to suffer and die for it.

Dr. William Lane Craig explains, “When you understand the role of women in first-century Jewish society, what’s really extraordinary is that this empty tomb story should feature women as the discoverers of the empty tomb in the first place.

 “The evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is so overwhelming that it compels acceptance by proof which leaves absolutely no room for doubt.”

 A dictionary definition of “religion” would be something similar to “belief in God or gods to be worshiped, usually expressed in conduct and ritual; any specific system of belief, worship, etc., often involving a code of ethics.” In light of this definition, the Bible does speak of organized religion, but in many cases the purpose and impact of “organized religion” are not something that God is pleased with.

In Genesis chapter 11, perhaps the first instance of organized religion, the descendants of Noah organized themselves to build the tower of Babel instead of obeying God’s command to fill the entire earth.
They believed that their unity was more important than their relationship with God.
God stepped in and confused their languages, thus breaking up this organized religion.
In Exodus chapter 6 and following, God “organized” a religion for the nation of Israel.
The Ten Commandments, the laws regarding the tabernacle, and the sacrificial system were all instituted by God and were to be followed by the Israelites.
Further study of the New Testament clarifies that the intent of this religion was to point to the need for a Savior-Messiah (Galatians 3; Romans 7).
However, many have misunderstood this and have worshiped the rules and rituals rather than God.
Throughout Israel’s history, many of the conflicts experienced by the Israelites involved conflict with organized religions.
Examples include the worship of Baal (Judges 6; 1 Kings 18), Dagon (1 Samuel 5), and Molech (2 Kings 23:10).
God defeated the followers of these religions, displaying His sovereignty and omnipotence.
In the Gospels, the Pharisees and Sadducees are depicted as the representatives of organized religion at the time of Christ.
Jesus constantly confronted them about their false teachings and hypocritical lifestyles.
In the Epistles, there were organized groups that mixed the gospel with certain lists of required works and rituals.
They also sought to put pressure on believers to change and accept these “Christianity plus” religions.
In the Gospels, the Pharisees and Sadducees are depicted as the representatives of organized religion at the time of Christ.
In the book of Revelation, organized religion will have an impact on the world as the Antichrist sets up a one-world religion.
In many cases, the end result of organized religion is a distraction from the intent of God.
God calls these groups of organized believers “churches.” The descriptions from the book of Acts and the Epistles indicate that the church is to be organized and interdependent.

The organization leads to protection, productivity, and outreach (Acts 2:41-47).
In the case of the church, it could better be called an “organized relationship.” 
 Religion is man’s attempt to have communion with God.
The Christian faith is a relationship with God because of what He has done for us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
There is no plan to reach God (He has reached out to us—Romans 5:8).
There is no pride (all is received by grace—Ephesians 2:8-9).
There should be no conflict over leadership (Christ is the head—Colossians 1:18).
There should be no prejudice (we are all one in Christ—Galatians 3:28).

You may feel like you are in the deepest pit, and you doubt there is any hope of things getting better.
If you will take a few moments to consider letting God truly be God in your life right now, He will prove how big He really is, “for nothing is impossible with God” (Luke 1:37).
That may lead to self-pity, anger, bitterness, vengeful thoughts, or unhealthy fears that have caused problems in some of your most important relationships.
Friend, no matter how bad things are in your life, there is a God of love who is waiting for you to let Him guide you through your tunnel of despair and out into His marvelous light.
The prophet Isaiah wrote of Him in Isaiah 53:2-6, describing Him as a man who was “despised and rejected” by everyone.

Some of His choicest servants committed gross sins like murder (Moses), murder and adultery (King David), and physical and emotional abuse (the apostle Paul).
“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor…to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve…to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.”

In Christ, you will still have struggles, but you will now have hope.
May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you in your hour of decision.
If you desire to trust Jesus Christ as your Savior, speak these words in your heart to God: “God, I need you in my life.

Perhaps scars from past hurts have resulted in an overwhelming sense of rejection or abandonment.
                                                                                         Answer
 We should read and study the Bible because it is God’s Word to us.
The Bible is literally "God-breathed" (2 Timothy 3:16).
In other words, it is God’s very words to us.
There are so many questions that philosophers have asked that God answers for us in Scripture.
In addition to these "big" questions, the Bible gives much practical advice in areas such as: What do I look for in a mate?
We should read and study the Bible because it is totally reliable and without error.
The Bible is unique among so-called "holy" books in that it does not merely give moral teaching and say, "Trust me."
Rather, we have the ability to test it by checking the hundreds of detailed prophecies that it makes, by checking the historical accounts it records, and by checking the scientific facts it relates.
Those who say the Bible has errors have their ears closed to the truth.
Jesus once asked which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven you," or "Rise, take up your bed and walk."
Similarly, we are given assurance that God’s Word is true when it discusses spiritual areas that we cannot test with our senses by showing itself true in those areas that we can test, such as historical accuracy, scientific accuracy, and prophetic accuracy.
Similarly, we are given assurance that God’s Word is true when it discusses spiritual areas that we cannot test with our senses by showing itself true in those areas that we can test, such as historical accuracy, scientific accuracy, and prophetic accuracy.
We should read and study the Bible because God does not change and because mankind’s nature does not change; it is as relevant for us as it was when it was written.
While technology changes, mankind’s nature and desires do not change.
We find, as we read the pages of biblical history, that whether we are talking about one-on-one relationships or societies, "there is nothing new under the sun" (Ecclesiastes 1:9).
And while mankind as a whole continues to seek love and satisfaction in all of the wrong places, God—our good and gracious Creator—tells us what will bring us lasting joy.
His revealed Word, the Bible, is so important that Jesus said of it, "Man does not live on bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).
In other words, if we want to live life to the fullest, as God intended, we must listen to and heed God’s written Word.
We should read and study the Bible because there is so much false teaching.
It tells us what God is like.
In other words, if we want to live life to the fullest, as God intended, we must listen to and heed God’s written Word.
How can I live so that I do not look back with regret?
The Bible tells us how one truly gets to heaven, and it is not by being good or by being baptized or by anything else we do (John 14:6; Ephesians 2:1-10; Isaiah 53:6; Romans 3:10-18, 5:8, 6:23, 10:9-13).
Along this line, God’s Word shows us just how much God loves us (Romans 5:6-8; John 3:16).
And it is in learning this that we are drawn to love Him in return (1 John 4:19).
The Bible equips us to serve God (2 Timothy 3:17; Ephesians 6:17; Hebrews 4:12).
It helps us know how to be saved from our sin and its ultimate consequence (2 Timothy 3:15).
Meditating on God’s Word and obeying its teachings will bring success in life (Joshua 1:8; James 1:25).
God’s Word helps us see sin in our lives and helps us get rid of it (Psalm 119:9, 11).
It gives us guidance in life, making us wiser than our teachers (Psalm 32:8, 119:99; Proverbs 1:6).
The Bible keeps us from wasting years of our lives on that which does not matter and will not last (Matthew 7:24-27).
Reading and studying the Bible helps us see beyond the attractive "bait" to the painful "hook" in sinful temptations, so that we can learn from others' mistakes rather than making them ourselves.
Experience is a great teacher, but when it comes to learning from sin, it is a terribly hard teacher.
Experience is a great teacher, but when it comes to learning from sin, it is a terribly hard teacher.
There are so many Bible characters to learn from, some of whom can serve as both positive and negative role models at different times in their lives.
For example, David, in his defeat of Goliath, teaches us that God is greater than anything He asks us to face (1 Samuel 17), while his giving in to the temptation to commit adultery with Bathsheba reveals just how long-lasting and terrible the consequences of a moment’s sinful pleasure can be (2 Samuel 11).
For example, David, in his defeat of Goliath, teaches us that God is greater than anything He asks us to face (1 Samuel 17), while his giving in to the temptation to commit adultery with Bathsheba reveals just how long-lasting and terrible the consequences of a moment’s sinful pleasure can be (2 Samuel 11).

Otherwise, it is like swallowing food without chewing and then spitting it back out again—no nutritional value is gained by it.
The Bible is God’s Word.
As such, it is as binding as the laws of nature.
We can ignore it, but we do so to our own detriment, just as we would if we ignored the law of gravity.
It cannot be emphasized strongly enough just how important the Bible is to our lives.
Studying the Bible can be compared to mining for gold.
If we make little effort and merely "sift through the pebbles in a stream," we will only find a little gold dust.
But the more we make an effort to really dig into it, the more reward we will gain for our effort.
 Questions about the Bible
For example, David, in his defeat of Goliath, teaches us that God is greater than anything He asks us to face (1 Samuel 17), while his giving in to the temptation to commit adultery with Bathsheba reveals just how long-lasting and terrible the consequences of a moment’s sinful pleasure can be (2 Samuel 11).
                                                                                         Answer
 Simply put, no, the Holy Spirit will never leave a true believer.
This is revealed in many different passages in the New Testament.
For example, Romans 8:9 tells us, “…if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.” This verse very clearly states that if someone does not have the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, then that person is not saved.
For example, Romans 8:9 tells us, “…if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.” This verse very clearly states that if someone does not have the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, then that person is not saved.
Therefore, if the Holy Spirit were to leave a believer, that person would have lost the saving relationship with Christ.
Yet this is contrary to what the Bible teaches about the eternal security of Christians.
Another verse that speaks to the permanence of the Holy Spirit’s indwelling presence in the life of believers is John 14:16.
Here Jesus states that the Father will give another Helper “to be with you forever.”
 The fact that the Holy Spirit will never leave a believer is also seen in Ephesians 1:13-14 where believers are said to be “sealed” with the Holy Spirit, “who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.” The picture of being sealed with the Spirit is one of ownership and possession.
Prior to Christ’s death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, the Holy Spirit had a “come and go” relationship with people.
God has promised eternal life to all who believe in Christ, and as a guarantee that He will keep His promise, He has sent the Holy Spirit to indwell the believer until the day of redemption.
Similar to making a down payment on a car or a house, God has provided all believers with a down payment on their future relationship with Him by sending the Holy Spirit to indwell them.
The fact that all believers are sealed with the Spirit is also seen in 2 Corinthians 1:22 and Ephesians 4:30.
Prior to Christ’s death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, the Holy Spirit had a “come and go” relationship with people.
The Holy Spirit indwelt King Saul, but then departed from him (1 Samuel 16:14).
Instead, the Spirit came upon David (1 Samuel 16:13).
After his adultery with Bathsheba, David feared that the Holy Spirit would be taken from him (Psalm 51:11).
The Holy Spirit filled Bezalel to enable him to produce the items needed for the tabernacle (Exodus 31:2-5), but this is not described as a permanent relationship.
All of this changed after Jesus’ ascension into heaven.
Beginning on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit began permanently indwelling believers (Acts 2).
The permanent indwelling of the Holy Spirit is the fulfillment of God’s promise to always be with us and never forsake us.
While the Holy Spirit will never leave a believer, it is possible for our sin to “quench the Holy Spirit” (1 Thessalonians 5:19) or “grieve the Holy Spirit” (Ephesians 4:30).
While our relationship with God is secure in Christ, unconfessed sin in our lives can hinder our fellowship with God and effectively quench the Holy Spirit’s working in our lives.
While our relationship with God is secure in Christ, unconfessed sin in our lives can hinder our fellowship with God and effectively quench the Holy Spirit’s working in our lives.
That is why it is so important to confess our sins because God is “faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).
So, while the Holy Spirit will never leave us, the benefits and joy of His presence can in fact depart from us.

                                                                                         Answer
 Many people say that the first thing they want to do when they arrive in heaven is see all their friends and loved ones who have passed on before them.
In eternity, there will be plenty of time to see, know, and spend time with our friends and family members.
However, that will not be our primary focus in heaven.
Our reunions with loved ones are more likely to be filled with recounting the grace and glory of God in our lives, His wondrous love, and His mighty works.
Our reunions with loved ones are more likely to be filled with recounting the grace and glory of God in our lives, His wondrous love, and His mighty works.
We will rejoice all the more because we can praise and worship the Lord in the company of other believers, especially those we loved on earth.
King Saul recognized Samuel when the witch of Endor summoned Samuel from the realm of the dead (1 Samuel 28:8-17).
King Saul recognized Samuel when the witch of Endor summoned Samuel from the realm of the dead (1 Samuel 28:8-17).
David assumed that he would be able to recognize his son in heaven, despite the fact that he died as a baby.
In Luke 16:19-31, Abraham, Lazarus, and the rich man were all recognizable after death.
At the transfiguration, Moses and Elijah were recognizable (Matthew 17:3-4).
In these examples, the Bible does seem to indicate that we will be recognizable after death.
The Bible declares that when we arrive in heaven, we will “be like him [Jesus]; for we shall see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).
Just as our earthly bodies were of the first man Adam, so will our resurrection bodies be just like Christ’s (1 Corinthians 15:47).
Just as our earthly bodies were of the first man Adam, so will our resurrection bodies be just like Christ’s (1 Corinthians 15:47).
For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality” (1 Corinthians 15:49, 53).
Many people recognized Jesus after His resurrection (John 20:16, 20; 21:12; 1 Corinthians 15:4-7).
Many people recognized Jesus after His resurrection (John 20:16, 20; 21:12; 1 Corinthians 15:4-7).
If Jesus was recognizable in His glorified body, we also will be recognizable in our glorified bodies.
Being able to see our loved ones is a glorious aspect of heaven, but heaven is far more about God, and far less about us.
What a pleasure it will be to be reunited with our loved ones and worship God with them for all eternity.
