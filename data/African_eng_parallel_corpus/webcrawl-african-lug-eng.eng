                                                                                         Answer
 First, it is important to recognize that this is not a question of whether God still performs miracles today.
It would be foolish and unbiblical to claim God does not heal people, speak to people, and perform miraculous signs and wonders today.
The question is whether the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, described primarily in 1 Corinthians 12–14, are still active in the church today.
This is also not a question of can the Holy Spirit give someone a miraculous gift.
The question is whether the Holy Spirit still dispenses the miraculous gifts today.
Above all else, we entirely recognize that the Holy Spirit is free to dispense gifts according to His will (1 Corinthians 12:7-11).
Above all else, we entirely recognize that the Holy Spirit is free to dispense gifts according to His will (1 Corinthians 12:7-11).
In the book of Acts and the Epistles, the vast majority of miracles are performed by the apostles and their close associates.
Paul gives us the reason why: “The things that mark an apostle—signs, wonders and miracles—were done among you with great perseverance” (2 Corinthians 12:12).
If every believer in Christ was equipped with the ability to perform signs, wonders, and miracles, then signs, wonders, and miracles could in no way be the identifying marks of an apostle.
Acts 2:22 tells us that Jesus was “accredited” by “miracles, wonders, and signs.” Similarly, the apostles were “marked” as genuine messengers from God by the miracles they performed.
In the book of Acts and the Epistles, the vast majority of miracles are performed by the apostles and their close associates.
Acts 14:3 describes the gospel message being “confirmed” by the miracles Paul and Barnabas performed.
Chapters 12–14 of 1 Corinthians deal primarily with the subject of the gifts of the Spirit.
It seems from that text “ordinary” Christians were sometimes given miraculous gifts (12:8-10, 28-30).
We are not told how commonplace this was.
From what we learned above, that the apostles were “marked” by signs and wonders, it would seem that miraculous gifts being given to “ordinary” Christians was the exception, not the rule.
Beside the apostles and their close associates, the New Testament nowhere specifically describes individuals exercising the miraculous gifts of the Spirit.
It is also important to realize that the early church did not have the completed Bible, as we do today (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
Therefore, the gifts of prophecy, knowledge, wisdom, etc.
The gift of prophecy enabled believers to communicate new truth and revelation from God.
Now that God’s revelation is complete in the Bible, the “revelatory” gifts are no longer needed, at least not in the same capacity as they were in the New Testament.
God miraculously heals people every day.
God still does amazing miracles, signs, and wonders and sometimes performs those miracles through a Christian.
God still does amazing miracles, signs, and wonders and sometimes performs those miracles through a Christian.
However, these things are not necessarily the miraculous gifts of the Spirit.
The primary purpose of the miraculous gifts was to prove that the gospel was true and that the apostles were truly God’s messengers.
The Bible does not say outright that the miraculous gifts have ceased, but it does lay the foundation for why they might no longer occur to the same extent as they did as recorded in the New Testament.

 Calvinism and Arminianism are two systems of theology that attempt to explain the relationship between God’s sovereignty and man’s responsibility in the matter of salvation.
Calvinism is named for John Calvin, a French theologian who lived from 1509-1564.
Calvinism is named for John Calvin, a French theologian who lived from 1509-1564.
Both systems can be summarized with five points.
Calvinism holds to the total depravity of man while Arminianism holds to partial depravity.
Calvinism holds to the total depravity of man while Arminianism holds to partial depravity.
Calvinism’s doctrine of total depravity states that every aspect of humanity is corrupted by sin; therefore, human beings are unable to come to God on their own accord.
Partial depravity states that every aspect of humanity is tainted by sin, but not to the extent that human beings are unable to place faith in God of their own accord.
Calvinism includes the belief that election is unconditional, while Arminianism believes in conditional election.
Note: classical Arminianism rejects “partial depravity” and holds a view very close to Calvinistic “total depravity” (although the extent and meaning of that depravity are debated in Arminian circles).
In general, Arminians believe there is an “intermediate” state between total depravity and salvation.
In this state, made possible by prevenient grace, the sinner is being drawn to Christ and has the God-given ability to choose salvation.
Calvinism includes the belief that God’s grace is irresistible, while Arminianism says that an individual can resist the grace of God.
Unconditional election is the view that God elects individuals to salvation based entirely on His will, not on anything inherently worthy in the individual.
Conditional election states that God elects individuals to salvation based on His foreknowledge of who will believe in Christ unto salvation, thereby on the condition that the individual chooses God.
Unlimited atonement is the belief that Jesus died for all, but that His death is not effectual until a person receives Him by faith.
Limited atonement is the belief that Jesus only died for the elect.
Limited atonement is the belief that Jesus only died for the elect.
Unlimited atonement is the belief that Jesus died for all, but that His death is not effectual until a person receives Him by faith.
This is the most controversial of the five points.
Calvinism includes the belief that God’s grace is irresistible, while Arminianism says that an individual can resist the grace of God.
Irresistible grace argues that when God calls a person to salvation, that person will inevitably come to salvation.
Resistible grace states that God calls all to salvation, but that many people resist and reject this call.
Irresistible grace argues that when God calls a person to salvation, that person will inevitably come to salvation.
Perseverance of the saints refers to the concept that a person who is elected by God will persevere in faith and will not permanently deny Christ or turn away from Him.
Calvinism holds to perseverance of the saints while Arminianism holds to conditional salvation.
Conditional salvation is the view that a believer in Christ can, of his/her own free will, turn away from Christ and thereby lose salvation.
Note - many Arminians deny "conditional salvation" and instead hold to "eternal security."
It is interesting to note that in the diversity of the body of Christ, there are all sorts of mixtures of Calvinism and Arminianism.
It is interesting to note that in the diversity of the body of Christ, there are all sorts of mixtures of Calvinism and Arminianism.
Many believers arrive at some sort of mixture of the two views.
Ultimately, it is our view that both systems fail in that they attempt to explain the unexplainable.
Human beings are incapable of fully grasping a concept such as this.
Yes, God is absolutely sovereign and knows all.
Yes, human beings are called to make a genuine decision to place faith in Christ unto salvation.
These two facts seem contradictory to us, but in the mind of God they make perfect sense.

 While the Bible does not explicitly state whether a Christian can be possessed by a demon, related biblical truths make it abundantly clear that Christians cannot be demon possessed.
Demon possession involves a demon having direct/complete control over the thoughts and/or actions of a person (Matthew 17:14-18; Luke 4:33-35; 8:27-33).
Demon oppression or influence involves a demon or demons attacking a person spiritually and/or encouraging him/her into sinful behavior.
Notice that in all the New Testament passages dealing with spiritual warfare, there are no instructions to cast a demon out of a believer (Ephesians 6:10-18).
Christians are indwelt by the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:9-11; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 6:19).
Believers are told to resist the devil (James 4:7; 1 Peter 5:8-9), not to cast him out.
The Holy Spirit.
Surely the Holy Spirit would not allow a demon to possess the same person He is indwelling.
It is unthinkable that God would allow one of His children, whom He purchased with the blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18-19) and made into a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), to be possessed and controlled by a demon.
Yes, as believers, we wage war with Satan and his demons, but not from within ourselves.
The apostle John declares, “You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the One who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world” (1 John 4:4).
Who is the One in us?
The Holy Spirit.
Who is the one in the world?
Satan and his demons.
Therefore, the believer has overcome the world of demons, and the case for demon possession of a believer cannot be made scripturally.
With the strong biblical evidence that a Christian cannot be demon possessed in view, some Bible teachers use the term “demonization” to refer to a demon having control over a Christian.
Some argue that while a Christian cannot be demon possessed, a Christian can be demonized.
Changing the terminology does not change the fact that a demon cannot inhabit or take full control of a Christian.
Demonic influence and oppression are realities for Christians, no doubt, but it is simply not biblical to say that a Christian can be possessed by a demon or demonized.
With the strong biblical evidence that a Christian cannot be demon possessed in view, some Bible teachers use the term “demonization” to refer to a demon having control over a Christian.
Much of the reasoning behind the demonization concept is the personal experience of seeing someone who was “definitely” a Christian exhibiting evidence of being controlled by a demon.
It is crucially important, though, that we do not allow personal experience to influence our interpretation of Scripture.
Rather, we must filter our personal experiences through the truth of Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
It is crucially important, though, that we do not allow personal experience to influence our interpretation of Scripture.
Seeing someone whom we thought to be a Christian exhibiting the behavior of being demonized should cause us to question the genuineness of his/her faith.
It should not cause us alter our viewpoint on whether a Christian can be demon possessed / demonized.
Perhaps the person truly is a Christian but is severely demon oppressed and/or suffering from severe psychological problems.
But again, our experiences must meet the test of Scripture, not the other way around.

 At first it might seem that if God created all things, then evil must have been created by God.
However, evil is not a “thing” like a rock or electricity.
You cannot have a jar of evil.
Evil has no existence of its own; it is really the absence of good.
For example, holes are real but they only exist in something else.
We call the absence of dirt a hole, but it cannot be separated from the dirt.
So when God created, it is true that all He created was good.
One of the good things God made was creatures who had the freedom to choose good.
In order to have a real choice, God had to allow there to be something besides good to choose.
So, God allowed these free angels and humans to choose good or reject good (evil).
When a bad relationship exists between two good things we call that evil, but it does not become a “thing” that required God to create it.
Perhaps a further illustration will help.
Perhaps a further illustration will help.
If a person is asked, “Does cold exist?” the answer would likely be “yes.” However, this is incorrect.
Similarly, darkness does not exist; it is the absence of light.
Cold is the absence of heat.
Similarly, darkness does not exist; it is the absence of light.
Evil is the absence of good, or better, evil is the absence of God.
God did not create evil, but He does allow evil.
God did not create evil, but He does allow evil.
If God had not allowed for the possibility of evil, both mankind and angels would be serving God out of obligation, not choice.
He did not want “robots” that simply did what He wanted them to do because of their “programming.” God allowed for the possibility of evil so that we could genuinely have a free will and choose whether or not we wanted to serve Him.
If God had not allowed for the possibility of evil, both mankind and angels would be serving God out of obligation, not choice.
As finite human beings, we can never fully understand an infinite God (Romans 11:33-34).
Sometimes we think we understand why God is doing something, only to find out later that it was for a different purpose than we originally thought.
God looks at things from a holy, eternal perspective.
We look at things from a sinful, earthly, and temporal perspective.
Why did God put man on earth knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and therefore bring evil, death, and suffering on all mankind?
Why didn’t He just create us all and leave us in heaven where we would be perfect and without suffering?
These questions cannot be adequately answered this side of eternity.
What we can know is whatever God does is holy and perfect and ultimately will glorify Him.
God allowed for the possibility of evil in order to give us a true choice in regards to whether we worship Him.
God did not create evil, but He allowed it.
If He had not allowed evil, we would be worshiping Him out of obligation, not by a choice of our own will.

 There is a great deal of confusion in regards to this question.
The concept that Jesus went to hell after His death on the cross comes primarily from the Apostles’ Creed, which states, “He descended into hell.” There are also a few Scriptures which, depending on how they are translated, describe Jesus going to “hell.” In studying this issue, it is important to first understand what the Bible teaches about the realm of the dead.
In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word used to describe the realm of the dead is sheol.
It simply means “the place of the dead” or “the place of departed souls/spirits.” The New Testament Greek equivalent of sheol is hades, which also refers to “the place of the dead.” Other Scriptures in the New Testament indicate that sheol/hades is a temporary place, where souls are kept as they await the final resurrection and judgment.
Revelation 20:11–15 gives a clear distinction between hades and the lake of fire.
The lake of fire is the permanent and final place of judgment for the lost.
Hades, then, is a temporary place.
Many people refer to both hades and the lake of fire as “hell,” and this causes confusion.
Jesus did not go to a place of torment after His death, but He did go to hades.
Sheol/hades was a realm with two divisions—a place of blessing and a place of judgment (Matthew 11:23; 16:18; Luke 10:15; 16:23; Acts 2:27–31).
Sheol/hades was a realm with two divisions—a place of blessing and a place of judgment (Matthew 11:23; 16:18; Luke 10:15; 16:23; Acts 2:27–31).
The abodes of the saved and the lost are both generally called “hades” in the Bible.
The abode of the saved is also called “Abraham’s bosom” (KJV) or “Abraham’s side” (NIV) in Luke 16:22 and “paradise” in Luke 23:43.
The abode of the unsaved is called “hell” (KJV) or “Hades” (NIV) in Luke 16:23.
The abodes of the saved and the lost are separated by a “great chasm” (Luke 16:26).
When Jesus died, He went to the blessed side of sheol and, from there, took the believers with Him to heaven (Ephesians 4:8–10).
Yes, according to Ephesians 4:8–10 and 1 Peter 3:18–20.
The judgment side of sheol/hades has remained unchanged.
All unbelieving dead go there awaiting their final judgment in the future.
Did Jesus go to sheol/hades?
Yes, according to Ephesians 4:8–10 and 1 Peter 3:18–20.
Some of the confusion has arisen from such passages as Psalm 16:10–11 as translated in the King James Version: “For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Thou wilt show me the path of life.” “Hell” is not a correct translation in this verse.
Thou wilt show me the path of life.” “Hell” is not a correct translation in this verse.
Unfortunately, in many versions of the Bible, translators are not consistent, or correct, in how they translate the Hebrew and Greek words for “sheol,” “hades,” and “hell.”
A correct reading would be “the grave” or “sheol.” Jesus said to the thief beside Him, “Today you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43); He did not say, “I will see you in hell.” Jesus’ body was in the tomb; His soul/spirit went to be with the blessed in sheol/hades.
 Some have the viewpoint that Jesus went to “hell” or the suffering side of sheol/hades in order to further be punished for our sins.
This idea is completely unbiblical.
It was the death of Jesus on the cross that sufficiently provided for our redemption.
It was the death of Jesus on the cross that sufficiently provided for our redemption.
It was His shed blood that effected our own cleansing from sin (1 John 1:7–9).
As He hung there on the cross, He took the sin burden of the whole human race upon Himself.
His suffering in our place was completed.
It was His shed blood that effected our own cleansing from sin (1 John 1:7–9).
This imputation of sin helps us understand Christ’s struggle in the garden of Gethsemane with the cup of sin which would be poured out upon Him on the cross.
As Jesus neared death, He said, “It is finished” (John 19:30).
His suffering in our place was completed.
He then awaited the resurrection of His body and His return to glory in His ascension.
His soul/spirit went to hades (the place of the dead).
His soul/spirit went to hades (the place of the dead).
Jesus’ suffering ended the moment He died.
The payment for sin was paid.
He then awaited the resurrection of His body and His return to glory in His ascension.

 The key to understanding the relationship between the Christian and the Law is knowing that the Old Testament law was given to the nation of Israel, not to Christians.
Some of the laws were to reveal to the Israelites how to obey and please God (the Ten Commandments, for example).
Some of the laws were to show the Israelites how to worship God and atone for sin (the sacrificial system).
Some of the laws were intended to make the Israelites distinct from other nations (the food and clothing rules).
None of the Old Testament law is binding on Christians today.
When Jesus died on the cross, He put an end to the Old Testament law (Romans 10:4; Galatians 3:23–25; Ephesians 2:15).
In place of the Old Testament law, Christians are under the law of Christ (Galatians 6:2), which is to “love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind…and to love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37-39).
If we obey those two commands, we will be fulfilling all that Christ requires of us: “All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments” (Matthew 22:40).
Now, this does not mean the Old Testament law is irrelevant today.
Many of the commands in the Old Testament law fall into the categories of “loving God” and “loving your neighbor.” The Old Testament law can be a good guidepost for knowing how to love God and knowing what goes into loving your neighbor.
At the same time, to say that the Old Testament law applies to Christians today is incorrect.
The Old Testament law is a unit (James 2:10).
Either all of it applies, or none of it applies.
If Christ fulfilled some of it, such as the sacrificial system, He fulfilled all of it.
“This is love for God: to obey his commands.
And his commands are not burdensome” (1 John 5:3).
The Ten Commandments were essentially a summary of the entire Old Testament law.
Nine of the Ten Commandments are clearly repeated in the New Testament (all except the command to observe the Sabbath day).
Obviously, if we are loving God, we will not be worshiping false gods or bowing down before idols.
If we are loving our neighbors, we will not be murdering them, lying to them, committing adultery against them, or coveting what belongs to them.
The purpose of the Old Testament law is to convict people of our inability to keep the law and point us to our need for Jesus Christ as Savior (Romans 7:7-9; Galatians 3:24).
The Old Testament law was never intended by God to be the universal law for all people for all of time.
We are to love God and love our neighbors.
If we obey those two commands faithfully, we will be upholding all that God requires of us.

 Questions about the Christian Life
                                                                                         Answer
 Whether God exists is one of the most basic and important questions any person can consider.
Opinions about God abound, but answering the question does God exist? demands more than a few seconds of attention and involves a wide range of ideas and evidence.
Ultimately, what we see in human experience, science, logic, and history leads to a confident answer: yes, God exists.
Often, this question is posed as “Can you prove God exists?” The problem is that, while truth itself is absolute, there are virtually zero instances of absolute proof outside of pure logic and mathematics.
For that reason, courtrooms don’t require absolute proof to reach a verdict; rather, they seek to dispel “reasonable doubt” and consider what’s “most probable.”
 Demanding “proof” of God that no one could ever reject is unreasonable.
Neither evidence nor people function that way in the real world.
“Encountering” facts and “accepting” them are profoundly different.
Airtight, sound arguments will remain unconvincing to those determined to disbelieve.
For the resolute skeptic, it’s not “proof,” even if it would convince almost anyone else.
A person’s intent is more influential than any evidence encountered.
That means a certain amount of “faith” is necessary—and not just regarding God’s existence.
Perfect knowledge is beyond our ability.
Bias and prejudice cloud our views.
There will always be a gap between what we can “know” and what we “believe.” This applies equally to skeptics and believers.
We cannot possibly know every detail involved every time we sit in a chair, eat food, or climb stairs.
Such actions all express a measure of faith.
We act, despite what we don’t know, because of what we do know.
That’s the essence of biblical faith, including faith in the existence of God.
We trust in what is known, leading us to action, despite a less-than-absolute understanding (Hebrews 11:6).
Whether or not one acknowledges God, the decision involves faith.
Belief in God does not require blind faith (John 20:29), but neither can it overcome malicious resistance (John 5:39–40).
Bolstering faith are human experience, logic, and empirical evidence, all of which help answer the question does God exist?
 Does God Exist?
— Human Experience
 Discussing the existence of God usually starts with logical arguments.
That makes sense, but it’s not how human beings normally operate.
No one starts devoid of all perspective, waiting to follow a robotically rational path before forming an opinion.
People interpret life based on the world around them.
So, looking at the existence of God ought to start with experiences.
Afterwards, we can use logic to assess those views.
Evidence of God exists in daily human experiences (Romans 1:19–20; Psalm 19:1; Ecclesiastes 3:11).
This includes our innate sense of morality.
It applies to the apparent design of the universe around us.
Human life compels belief that truth, deception, love, hate, goodness, evil, etc., are real and meaningful.
The overwhelming majority of people throughout history have been inclined to believe in a reality greater than the physical.
Our experiences are not conclusive evidence, of course.
Instead, God uses general revelation as an invitation (Revelation 3:20).
Common experiences are meant to emphasize that we ought to seek further answers (Matthew 7:7–8).
Those who ignore or disdain God’s invitation don’t have the excuse of ignorance (Romans 1:18; Psalm 14:1).
Does God Exist?
— Human Logic
 Three of the more powerful logical suggestions of God’s existence are the cosmological, teleological, and moral arguments.
The cosmological argument considers the principle of cause and effect.
Each effect is the result of some cause, and each cause is the effect of a prior cause.
However, that chain of causes cannot go on infinitely into the past, or else the chain would never actually start.
Logic demands something eternally existent and that is not itself the effect of anything else.
Our universe, clearly, is not eternal or uncaused.
Logic points to God: the uncreated, eternal measure of all other things, the First Cause of our reality.
The teleological argument examines the structure of the universe.
The largest galactic configurations, our solar system, our DNA, subatomic particles—everything gives the appearance of having been purposefully arranged.
This trait is so strong that even hardened atheists have difficulty explaining away the appearance of design.
Nothing about subatomic particles or forces indicates they must be arranged as they are.
Yet, if they were not exactly as they are, complex matter—and life—would be impossible.
Dozens of universal constants coordinate with mind-boggling precision just to make life possible, let alone actual.
Science has never observed or explained life arising from non-life, yet it also shows a sudden onset of complex organisms.
A team of archaeologists who saw the words I am here on a cave wall would universally assume intelligent action.
Meanwhile, human DNA represents a coding structure beyond the ability of the best human engineers.
The weight of this evidence, logically, favors the idea of an Intelligent Designer—God—as an explanation.
The moral argument points to concepts like good and evil, ethics, and so forth.
It’s notable that these are discussions of “what should be,” not merely “what is.” Moral principles are drastically disconnected from the ruthless, selfish reasoning that one would expect of a creature randomly evolved to survive at any cost.
The very idea that human beings think in non-physical, moral terms is striking.
Beyond that, the fundamental content of human morals remains constant throughout history and across cultures.
Further, discussion of moral ideas leads inevitably to a crossroads.
Either moral ideas are completely subjective, and therefore meaningless, or they must be grounded in some unchanging standard.
Human experience doesn’t support the conclusion that morals mean nothing.
The most reasonable explanation for why people think in moral terms and share moral ideals is a real moral law provided by a Moral Lawgiver, i.e., God.
Does God Exist?
— Human Science
 The logical arguments above are inspired by observations.
Concepts such as the Big Bang Theory demonstrate, at the very least, the scientific validity of a created, non-eternal universe.
Likewise for the structure of DNA.
Empirical data lends credibility to the idea of a biblical Creator and contradicts alternative explanations, such as an eternal universe or abiogenesis.
Archaeology also lends support to the Bible.
People, events, and places depicted in Scripture have repeatedly been confirmed by secular discoveries.
Many of these discoveries came after skeptics implied the Bible’s accounts were fictional.
History and literature, for their part, also support the existence of God.
The preservation of the Bible is one example: our ability to trace the existing text of Scripture to a time so close to the original events supports the Bible’s reliability.
Judeo-Christian influence on culture, morality, human rights, and the birth of modern science also strongly indicates an approach aligned with truth.
Does God Exist?
— God in Us
 Each of the prior categories is an entire field of study and the subject of thousands of books.
Yet the existence of God is demonstrated most profoundly, for most people, in personal experience.
It may be impossible to “prove” to others that you’re happy, for instance, but that doesn’t change the fact that you are.
That’s not to say internal perspective outweighs objective truth, but complex truths are often powerfully supported by individual experiences.
Changed lives, reformed attitudes, and answers to prayer are all part of our personal perception that God exists.
A personal sense of truth is a compelling way we know God exists, and it’s God’s intent for all people to experience that sense.
God came to earth personally, as a human being (2 Corinthians 4:6), so we could have a personal relationship with Him (John 14:6).
Those who sincerely seek God will find Him (Matthew 7:7–8), resulting in the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit (John 14:26–27).
The question does God exist?, therefore, cannot be answered with absolute proof, but we can point to the weight of evidence that suggests He does exist.
Accepting the existence of God is not a blind-faith leap into the dark.
It’s a trusting step out of the dark into a well-lit room where many things are made clear.

With the hundreds of times the Bible records God speaking, we have to remember that they occur over the course of 4,000 years of human history.
 The Bible records God speaking audibly to people many times (Exodus 3:14; Joshua 1:1; Judges 6:18; 1 Samuel 3:11; 2 Samuel 2:1; Job 40:1; Isaiah 7:3; Jeremiah 1:7; Acts 8:26; 9:15—this is just a small sampling).
There is no biblical reason why God could not speak to a person audibly today.
With the hundreds of times the Bible records God speaking, we have to remember that they occur over the course of 4,000 years of human history.
Even in the biblically recorded instances of God speaking, it is not always clear whether it was an audible voice, an inner voice, or a mental impression.
God does speak to people today.
First, God speaks to us through His Word (2 Timothy 3:16–17).
Isaiah 55:11 tells us, “So is my word that goes out from my mouth: it will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.” The Bible is God’s Word, and it contains everything we need to know in order to be saved and live the Christian life.
Second Peter 1:3 declares, “His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us by his own glory and goodness.”
 God can also “speak” to us through events—i.e., He can guide us through arranging our circumstances.
And God helps us to discern right from wrong through our consciences (1 Timothy 1:5; 1 Peter 3:16).
God is in the process of conforming our minds to think His thoughts (Romans 12:2).
God is in the process of conforming our minds to think His thoughts (Romans 12:2).
God allows events to occur in our lives to direct us, change us, and help us to grow spiritually (James 1:2–5; Hebrews 12:5–11).
God allows events to occur in our lives to direct us, change us, and help us to grow spiritually (James 1:2–5; Hebrews 12:5–11).
First Peter 1:6–7 reminds us, “In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
 God may sometimes speak audibly to people.
If anyone claims that God has spoken to him or her, always compare what is said with what the Bible says.
If anyone claims that God has spoken to him or her, always compare what is said with what the Bible says.
If God were to speak today, His words would be in full agreement with what He has said in the Bible (2 Timothy 3:16–17).
God does not contradict Himself.

 If we read the Bible at face value, without a preconceived bias for finding errors, we will find it to be a coherent, consistent, and relatively easy-to-understand book.
                                                                                         Answer
                                                                                         Answer
Yes, there are verses that appear to contradict each other.
We must remember that the Bible was written by approximately 40 different authors over a period of around 1,500 years.
Each writer wrote with a different style, from a different perspective, to a different audience, for a different purpose.
We should expect some minor differences.
However, a difference is not a contradiction.
It is only an error if there is absolutely no conceivable way the verses or passages can be reconciled.
Even if an answer is not available right now, that does not mean an answer does not exist.
Many have found a supposed error in the Bible in relation to history or geography only to find out that the Bible is correct once further archaeological evidence is discovered.
We often receive questions along the lines of “Explain how these verses do not contradict!” or “Look, here is an error in the Bible!” Admittedly, some of the things people bring up are difficult to answer.
There are books and websites available that list “all the errors in the Bible.” Most people simply get their ammunition from these places; they do not find supposed errors on their own.
There are also books and websites available that refute every one of these supposed errors.
The saddest thing is that most people who attack the Bible are not truly interested in an answer.
Many “Bible attackers” are even aware of these answers, but they continue to use the same old shallow attacks again and again.
So, what are we to do when someone approaches us with an alleged Bible error?

 When people come to know Christ as their Savior, they are brought into a relationship with God that guarantees their eternal security.
Jude 24 declares, "To Him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before His glorious presence without fault and with great joy."
It is up to Him, not us, to present us before His glorious presence.
Our eternal security is a result of God keeping us, not us maintaining our own salvation.
The Lord Jesus Christ proclaimed, "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand" (John 10:28-29b).
Both Jesus and the Father have us firmly grasped in their hand.
Who could possibly separate us from the grip of both the Father and the Son?
Ephesians 4:30 tells us that believers are "sealed for the day of redemption."
If believers did not have eternal security, the sealing could not truly be unto the day of redemption, but only to the day of sinning, apostasy, or disbelief.
John 3:15-16 tells us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ will "have eternal life."
If a person were to be promised eternal life, but then have it taken away, it was never "eternal" to begin with.
If eternal security is not true, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in error.
The most powerful argument for eternal security is Romans 8:38-39, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Our eternal security is based on God’s love for those whom He has redeemed.
Our eternal security is purchased by Christ, promised by the Father, and sealed by the Holy Spirit.

What is forgiveness and why do I need it?
 The word "forgive" means to wipe the slate clean, to pardon, to cancel a debt.
When we wrong someone, we seek their forgiveness in order for the relationship to be restored.
Forgiveness is not granted because a person deserves to be forgiven.
No one deserves to be forgiven.
Forgiveness is an act of love, mercy, and grace.
Forgiveness is a decision to not hold something against another person, despite what they have done to you.
The Bible tells us that we are all in need of forgiveness from God.
We have all committed sin.
Ecclesiastes 7:20 proclaims, "There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins."
First John 1:8 says, "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."
As a result, we desperately need God’s forgiveness.
If our sins are not forgiven, we will spend eternity suffering the consequences of our sins (Matthew 25:46; John 3:36).
Forgiveness – How do I get it?
God desires to forgive us, so He provided for our forgiveness.

Praise God, through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the second half of Romans 6:23 is true, "…but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Ephesians 1:7 says, "In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace."
Forgiveness of your sins is available if you will place your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.
Jesus paid our debt for us, so we could be forgiven.
Jesus paid our debt for us, so we could be forgiven.
All you have to do is ask God to forgive you through Jesus, believing that Jesus died to pay for your forgiveness – and He will forgive you!
John 3:16-17 contains this wonderful message, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him."

 The term “canon” is used to describe the books that are divinely inspired and therefore belong in the Bible.
The difficulty in determining the biblical canon is that the Bible does not give us a list of the books that belong in the Bible.
Determining the canon was a process conducted first by Jewish rabbis and scholars and later by early Christians.
Ultimately, it was God who decided what books belonged in the biblical canon.
A book of Scripture belonged in the canon from the moment God inspired its writing.
It was simply a matter of God’s convincing His human followers which books should be included in the Bible.
Compared to the New Testament, there was much less controversy over the canon of the Old Testament.
Hebrew believers recognized God’s messengers and accepted their writings as inspired of God.
While there was undeniably some debate in regards to the Old Testament canon, by A.D. 250 there was nearly universal agreement on the canon of Hebrew Scripture.
While there was undeniably some debate in regards to the Old Testament canon, by A.D. 250 there was nearly universal agreement on the canon of Hebrew Scripture.
The only issue that remained was the Apocrypha, with some debate and discussion continuing today.
The vast majority of Hebrew scholars considered the Apocrypha to be good historical and religious documents, but not on the same level as the Hebrew Scriptures.
For the New Testament, the process of the recognition and collection began in the first centuries of the Christian church.
Very early on, some of the New Testament books were being recognized.
Paul considered Luke’s writings to be as authoritative as the Old Testament (1 Timothy 5:18; see also Deuteronomy 25:4 and Luke 10:7).
Peter recognized Paul’s writings as Scripture (2 Peter 3:15-16).
Some of the books of the New Testament were being circulated among the churches (Colossians 4:16; 1 Thessalonians 5:27).
Clement of Rome mentioned at least eight New Testament books (A.D. 95).
Hippolytus recognized 22 books (A.D. 170-235).
Ignatius of Antioch acknowledged about seven books (A.D. 115).
Polycarp, a disciple of John the apostle, acknowledged 15 books (A.D. 108).
Later, Irenaeus mentioned 21 books (A.D. 185).
Hippolytus recognized 22 books (A.D. 170-235).
The Muratorian Canon included all of the New Testament books except Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, and 3 John.
The Muratorian Canon included all of the New Testament books except Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, and 3 John.
In AD 363, the Council of Laodicea stated that only the Old Testament (along with one book of the Apocrypha) and 26 books of the New Testament (everything but Revelation) were canonical and to be read in the churches.
The Council of Hippo (AD 393) and the Council of Carthage (AD 397) also affirmed the same 27 books as authoritative.
The councils followed something similar to the following principles to determine whether a New Testament book was truly inspired by the Holy Spirit: 1) Was the author an apostle or have a close connection with an apostle?
Omuwandiisi yali Mutume oba yalina kakwate n’omutume yenna?
Ekitabo kikirizibwa omubiri gwa Kristu?
Ekitabo kilemera ku nsomesa entufu ekirizibwa?
Ekitabo kilina obujulizi obw’empisa n’enkola z’omwoyo ezilaga emirimu gy’Omwoyo Mutukuvu.
Again, it is crucial to remember that the church did not determine the canon.
No early church council decided on the canon.
It was God, and God alone, who determined which books belonged in the Bible.
It was simply a matter of God’s imparting to His followers what He had already decided.
The human process of collecting the books of the Bible was flawed, but God, in His sovereignty, and despite our ignorance and stubbornness, brought the early church to the recognition of the books He had inspired.

 An important verse in understanding the filling of the Holy Spirit is John 14:16, where Jesus promised the Spirit would indwell believers and that the indwelling would be permanent.
It is important to distinguish the indwelling from the filling of the Spirit.
The permanent indwelling of the Spirit is not for a select few believers, but for all believers.
There are a number of references in Scripture that support this conclusion.
First, the Holy Spirit is a gift given to all believers in Jesus without exception, and no conditions are placed upon this gift except faith in Christ (John 7:37-39).
Second, the Holy Spirit is given at the moment of salvation (Ephesians 1:13).
Third, the Holy Spirit indwells believers permanently.
Romans 8:9 and Ephesians 1:13-14 states that He dwells within every believer, but He can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30), and His activity within us can be quenched (1 Thessalonians 5:19).
Galatians 3:2 emphasizes this same truth, saying that the sealing and indwelling of the Spirit took place at the time of believing.
Third, the Holy Spirit indwells believers permanently.
The Holy Spirit is given to believers as a down payment, or verification of their future glorification in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:22; Ephesians 4:30).
This is in contrast to the filling of the Spirit referred to in Ephesians 5:18.
To be filled with the Spirit implies freedom for Him to occupy every part of our lives, guiding and controlling us.
Romans 8:9 and Ephesians 1:13-14 states that He dwells within every believer, but He can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30), and His activity within us can be quenched (1 Thessalonians 5:19).
Romans 8:9 and Ephesians 1:13-14 states that He dwells within every believer, but He can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30), and His activity within us can be quenched (1 Thessalonians 5:19).
When we allow this to happen, we do not experience the fullness of the Spirit’s working and His power in and through us.
To be filled with the Spirit implies freedom for Him to occupy every part of our lives, guiding and controlling us.
The filling of the Spirit does not apply to outward acts alone; it also applies to the innermost thoughts and motives of our actions.
Psalm 19:14 says, "May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer."
Sin is what hinders the filling of the Holy Spirit, and obedience to God is how the filling of the Spirit is maintained.
Ephesians 5:18 commands that we be filled with the Spirit; however, it is not praying for the filling of the Holy Spirit that accomplishes the filling.
Only our obedience to God’s commands allows the Spirit freedom to work within us.
Because we are still infected with sin, it is impossible to be filled with the Spirit all of the time.
When we sin, we should immediately confess it to God and renew our commitment to being Spirit-filled and Spirit-led.

The problem is that many followers of Jesus Christ look for the assurance of salvation in the wrong places.
We tend to seek assurance of salvation in the things God is doing in our lives, in our spiritual growth, in the good works and obedience to God’s Word that is evident in our Christian walk.
While these things can be evidence of salvation, they are not what we should base the assurance of our salvation on.
Rather, we should find the assurance of our salvation in the objective truth of God’s Word.
We should have confident trust that we are saved based on the promises God has declared, not because of our subjective experiences.
How can you have assurance of salvation?
Consider 1 John 5:11–13: “And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (emphasis added).
Who is it that has the Son?
It is those who have believed in Him (John 1:12).
If you have Jesus, you have life.
Not temporary life, but eternal.
God wants us to have assurance of our salvation.
We should not live our Christian lives wondering and worrying each day whether we are truly saved.
That is why the Bible makes the plan of salvation so clear.
I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (emphasis added).
Do you believe that Jesus died to pay the penalty for your sins and rose again from the dead (John 3:16; Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21)?
Do you trust Him alone for salvation?
Do you trust Him alone for salvation?
If your answer to these questions is “yes,” you are saved!
Take joy in what God’s Word is saying to you: instead of doubting, we can live with confidence!
Jesus Himself assures those who believe in Him: “I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.
Jesus Himself assures those who believe in Him: “I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.
Believe in Jesus Christ (John 3:16; Acts 16:31).
Not temporary life, but eternal.
There is no one, not even yourself, who can take Christ’s God-given gift of salvation away from you.
By taking God’s Word to heart, you can have no doubt about the reality of your eternal salvation.
We can have the assurance from Christ’s own Word that our salvation will never be in question.
Our assurance of salvation is based on the perfect and complete salvation God has provided for us through Jesus Christ.

 Do you know for certain that you have eternal life and that you will go to heaven when you die?
God wants you to be sure!
The Bible says: “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (1 John 5:13).
Suppose you were standing before God right now and He asked you, “Why should I let you into heaven?” What would you say?
You may not know what to reply.
What you need to know is that God loves us and has provided a way that we can know for sure where we will spend eternity.
The Bible states it this way: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
We have to first understand the problem that is keeping us from heaven.
The problem is this - our sinful nature keeps us from having a relationship with God.
We are sinners by nature and by choice.
“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).
We cannot save ourselves.
“For by grace are you saved, through faith, and this not of yourselves – it is the gift of God.
Not by works, so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9).
We deserve death and hell.
“For the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).
God is holy and just and must punish sin, yet He loves us and has provided forgiveness for our sin.
Jesus said: “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
Jesus died for us on the cross: “For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous to bring you to God” (1 Peter 3:18).
Jesus was resurrected from the dead: “He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification” (Romans 4:25).
So, back to the original question – “How can I know for sure that I will go to heaven when I die?” The answer is this – believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved (Acts 16:31).
“To all who received Him, to those who believed in His Name, He gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).
You can receive eternal life as a FREE gift.
“The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).
You can live a full and meaningful life right now.
Jesus said: “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
You can spend eternity with Jesus in heaven, for He promised: “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you may also be where I am” (John 14:3).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and receive forgiveness from God, here is prayer you can pray.
Saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Jesus Christ that can provide forgiveness of sins.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your forgiveness.
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.&nbsp;But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.&nbsp;Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness!&nbsp;Amen!"

 It is important to know God’s will.
Jesus said that His true relations are those who know and do the Father’s will: “Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother” (Mark 3:35).
Jesus said that His true relations are those who know and do the Father’s will: “Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother” (Mark 3:35).
In the parable of the two sons, Jesus rebukes the chief priests and elders for failing to do the will of the Father; specifically, they “did not repent and believe” (Matthew 21:32).
At its most basic, the will of God is to repent of our sin and trust in Christ.
At its most basic, the will of God is to repent of our sin and trust in Christ.
Once we receive Christ by faith, we are made God’s children (John 1:12), and He desires to lead us in His way (Psalm 143:10).
God is not trying to hide His will from us; He wants to reveal it.
In fact, He has already given us many, many directions in His Word.
We are to “give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you” (1 Thessalonians 5:18).
We are to do good works (1 Peter 2:15).
We are to do good works (1 Peter 2:15).
And “it is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3).
God’s will is knowable and provable.
Romans 12:2 says, “Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
For example, the Bible forbids stealing; since God has clearly spoken on the issue, we know it is not His will for us to be bank robbers—we don’t even need to pray about it.
As we seek God’s will, we should make sure what we are considering is not something the Bible forbids.

For example, the Bible forbids stealing; since God has clearly spoken on the issue, we know it is not His will for us to be bank robbers—we don’t even need to pray about it.
Also, we should make sure what we are considering will glorify God and help us and others grow spiritually.
Knowing God’s will is sometimes difficult because it requires patience.
It’s natural to want to know all of God’s will at once, but that’s not how He usually works.
He reveals to us a step at a time—each move a step of faith—and allows us to continue to trust Him.
The important thing is that, as we wait for further direction, we are busy doing the good that we know to do (James 4:17).
Often, we want God to give us specifics—where to work, where to live, whom to marry, what car to buy, etc.
The same is true in our relationship to God.
The better we get to know a person, the more acquainted we become with his or her desires.
For example, a child may look across a busy street at the ball that bounced away, but he doesn’t run after it, because he knows “my dad wouldn’t want me to do that.” He doesn’t have to ask his father for advice on every particular situation; he knows what his father would say because he knows his father.

The same is true in our relationship to God.
As we walk with the Lord, obeying His Word and relying on His Spirit, we find that we are given the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16).
We know Him, and that helps us to know His will.
We find God’s guidance readily available.
“The righteousness of the blameless makes their paths straight, / but the wicked are brought down by their own wickedness” (Proverbs 11:5).
If we are walking closely with the Lord and truly desiring His will for our lives, God will place His desires in our hearts.
The key is wanting God’s will, not our own.
“Delight yourself in the LORD and He will give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4).

 The Bible presents several different resources to aid us in our effort to overcome sin.
In this lifetime, we will never be perfectly victorious over sin (1 John 1:8), but that should still be our goal.
The first resource the Bible mentions in our effort to overcome sin is the Holy Spirit.
With God’s help, and by following the principles of His Word, we can progressively overcome sin and become more and more like Christ.
The first resource the Bible mentions in our effort to overcome sin is the Holy Spirit.
God has given us the Holy Spirit so we can be victorious in Christian living.
God contrasts the deeds of the flesh with the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:16-25.
In that passage we are called upon to walk in the Spirit.
All believers already possess the Holy Spirit, but this passage tells us that we need to walk in the Spirit, yielding to His control.
This means choosing to consistently follow the Holy Spirit’s prompting in our lives rather than following the flesh.
God has given us the Holy Spirit so we can be victorious in Christian living.
The difference the Holy Spirit can make is demonstrated in the life of Peter, who, before being filled with the Holy Spirit, denied Jesus three times—and this after he had said he would follow Christ to the death.
After being filled with the Spirit, he spoke openly and strongly to the Jews at Pentecost.
We walk in the Spirit as we try not to quench the Spirit’s promptings (as spoken of in 1 Thessalonians 5:19) and seek instead to be filled with the Spirit—that is, to be fully under the Spirit’s control (Ephesians 5:18–21).
How is one filled with the Holy Spirit?
This he did, even when what God commanded did not make sense militarily, and this was the key to his victory in his battles for the Promised Land.
We walk in the Spirit as we try not to quench the Spirit’s promptings (as spoken of in 1 Thessalonians 5:19) and seek instead to be filled with the Spirit—that is, to be fully under the Spirit’s control (Ephesians 5:18–21).
This gives the Spirit freedom to work within our thoughts and actions.
The Word of God, the Bible, says that God has given us His Word to equip us for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
Hebrews 4:12 tells us that the Word of God is living and powerful, able to penetrate to our hearts to root out and overcome the deepest sins of heart and attitude.
The psalmist talks about its life-changing power in-depth in Psalm 119.
Joshua was told that the key to success in overcoming his enemies was not to forget this resource but instead to meditate on it day and night and obey it.
This he did, even when what God commanded did not make sense militarily, and this was the key to his victory in his battles for the Promised Land.
The Bible is a resource that we too often treat lightly.
We give token service to it by carrying our Bibles to church or reading a daily devotional or a chapter a day, but we fail to memorize it, meditate on it, or apply it to our lives; we fail to confess the sins it reveals or praise God for the gifts it reveals to us.
Some find it helpful start a journal.
Make it a habit not to leave the Word until you have written down something you have gained from it.
We either take in just enough to keep us alive spiritually by eating from the Word (but never ingesting enough to be healthy, thriving Christians), or we come to feed often but never meditate on it long enough to get spiritual nutrition from it.
It is important, if you have not made a habit of daily studying and memorizing God’s Word, that you begin to do so.

It is important, if you have not made a habit of daily studying and memorizing God’s Word, that you begin to do so.
Paul repeatedly mentions how he prayed for those he ministered to.
The Bible is the tool the Spirit uses in our lives (Ephesians 6:17), an essential and major part of the armor that God gives us to fight our spiritual battles (Ephesians 6:12-18).
A third crucial resource in our battle against sin is prayer.
Again, it is a resource that Christians often give lip service to but make poor use of.
We have prayer meetings, times of prayer, etc., but we do not use prayer in the same way as the early church (Acts 3:1; 4:31; 6:4; 13:1-3).
God has given us wonderful promises concerning prayer (Matthew 7:7-11; Luke 18:1-8; John 6:23-27; 1 John 5:14-15), and Paul includes prayer in his passage on preparing for spiritual battle (Ephesians 6:18).
How important is prayer to overcoming sin in our lives?
We have Christ’s words to Peter in the Garden of Gethsemane, just before Peter’s denial.
As Jesus prays, Peter is sleeping.
Jesus wakes him and says, “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.
We, like Peter, want to do what is right but are not finding the strength.
We need to follow God’s admonition to keep seeking, keep knocking, keep asking—and He will give us the strength that we need (Matthew 7:7).
Prayer is not a magic formula.
Prayer is simply acknowledging our own limitations and God’s inexhaustible power and turning to Him for that strength to do what He wants us to do, not what we want to do (1 John 5:14-15).
A fourth resource in our war to conquer sin is the church, the fellowship of other believers.
When Jesus sent His disciples out, He sent them out two-by-two (Mark 6:7).
The missionaries in Acts did not go out one at a time, but in groups of two or more.
The Bible commands us not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together but to use that time for encouraging one another in love and good works (Hebrews 10:24).
In the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, we are told that as iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another (Proverbs 27:17).
There is strength in numbers (Ecclesiastes 4:11-12).
Many Christians find that having an accountability partner can be a huge benefit in overcoming stubborn sins.
Having another person who can talk with you, pray with you, encourage you, and even rebuke you is of great value.
Temptation is common to us all (1 Corinthians 10:13).
Having an accountability partner or an accountability group can give us the final dose of encouragement and motivation we need to overcome even the most stubborn of sins.
Sometimes victory over sin comes quickly.
God has promised that as we make use of His resources, He will progressively bring about change in our lives.
We can persevere in our efforts to overcome sin because we know that He is faithful to His promises.

 It is impossible for us to fully understand the relationship between God’s sovereignty and man’s free will and responsibility.
Only God truly knows how they work together in His plan of salvation.
With this doctrine, probably more so than with any other, it is crucially important to admit our inability to fully grasp the nature of God and our relationship with Him.
Going too far to either side results in a distorted understanding of salvation.
God knows who will be saved and God chooses who will be saved, and we must choose Christ in order to be saved.
The fact that believers are predestined (Romans 8:29-30; Ephesians 1:5, 11) and elected for salvation (Romans 9:11, 11:28; 2 Peter 1:10) is clear.
The fact that believers are predestined (Romans 8:29-30; Ephesians 1:5, 11) and elected for salvation (Romans 9:11, 11:28; 2 Peter 1:10) is clear.
The Bible also says that we are responsible for receiving Christ as Savior.
If we believe in Jesus Christ we will be saved (John 3:16; Romans 10:9-10).
God knows who will be saved and God chooses who will be saved, and we must choose Christ in order to be saved.
How these facts work together is impossible for a finite mind to comprehend (Romans 11:33-36).
Our responsibility is to take the gospel to the world (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8).
Is predestination biblical?

 In order to get “right” with God, we must first understand what is “wrong.” The answer is sin.
“There is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 14:3).
We have rebelled against God’s commands; we “like sheep, have gone astray” (Isaiah 53:6).
The bad news is that the penalty for sin is death.
“The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4).
The good news is that a loving God has pursued us in order to bring us salvation.
Jesus declared His purpose was “to seek and to save what was lost” (Luke 19:10), and He pronounced His purpose accomplished when He died on the cross with the words, “It is finished!” (John 19:30).
Having a right relationship with God begins with acknowledging your sin.
Next comes a humble confession of your sin to God (Isaiah 57:15).
“For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved” (Romans 10:10).
This repentance must be accompanied by faith – specifically, faith that Jesus’ sacrificial death and miraculous resurrection qualify Him to be your Savior.
“If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9).
Many other passages speak of the necessity of faith, such as John 20:27; Acts 16:31; Galatians 2:16; 3:11, 26; and Ephesians 2:8.
Being right with God is a matter of your response to what God has done on your behalf.
He sent the Savior, He provided the sacrifice to take away your sin (John 1:29), and He offers you the promise: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Acts 2:21).
A beautiful illustration of repentance and forgiveness is the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32).
The younger son wasted his father’s gift in shameful sin (verse 13).
When he acknowledged his wrongdoing, he decided to return home (verse 18).
He assumed he would no longer be considered a son (verse 19), but he was wrong.
The father loved the returned rebel as much as ever (verse 20).
All was forgiven, and a celebration ensued (verse 24).
God is good to keep His promises, including the promise to forgive.
“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18).
If you want to get right with God, here is a sample prayer.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness – the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"

 There is no magic formula or definitive test that can tell us exactly what our spiritual gifts are.
That is not how the spiritual gifts work.
A common problem for Christians is the temptation to get so caught up in our spiritual gift that we only seek to serve God in the area in which we feel we have been gifted.
That is not how the spiritual gifts work.
God calls us to obediently serve Him in all things.
He will equip us with whatever gift or gifts we need to accomplish the task He has called us to.
Identifying our spiritual giftedness can be accomplished in various ways.
Spiritual gift tests or inventories, while not to be fully relied upon, can definitely help us understand where our gifting might be.
We can ask God to show us how we are gifted in order to better use our spiritual gifts for His glory.
Other people who see us serving the Lord can often identify a spiritual gift in us that we might take for granted or not recognize.
Prayer is also important.
The one person who knows exactly how we are spiritually gifted is the gift-giver Himself—the Holy Spirit.
We can ask God to show us how we are gifted in order to better use our spiritual gifts for His glory.
Yes.
Yes, God calls some to be teachers and gives them the gift of teaching.
However, specifically knowing our spiritual gift does not excuse us from serving God in areas outside our gifting.
Is it beneficial to know what spiritual gift(s) God has given us?
Yes.
Is it wrong to focus so much on spiritual gifts that we miss other opportunities to serve God?
Yes.
If we are dedicated to being used by God, He will equip us with the spiritual gifts we need.

 Since the fall of man, the basis of salvation has always been the death of Christ.
No one, either prior to the cross or since the cross, would ever be saved without that one pivotal event in the history of the world.
Christ’s death paid the penalty for past sins of Old Testament saints and future sins of New Testament saints.
                                                                                         Answer
God’s requirement of what must be believed is based on the amount of revelation He has given mankind up to that time.
This is called progressive revelation.
Adam believed the promise God gave in Genesis 3:15 that the Seed of the woman would conquer Satan.
Adam believed Him, demonstrated by the name he gave Eve (v. 20) and the Lord indicated His acceptance immediately by covering them with coats of skin (v. 21).
At that point that is all Adam knew, but he believed it.
Abraham believed God according to the promises and new revelation God gave him in Genesis 12 and 15.
Prior to Moses, no Scripture was written, but mankind was responsible for what God had revealed.
What did they believe?
Did they understand the full picture of Christ dying on a cross for their sins?
Genesis 15:6 tells us that Abraham believed God and that was enough for God to credit it to him for righteousness (see also Romans 4:3-8).
What about believers in Christ’s day, prior to the cross and resurrection?
What did they believe?
Did they understand the full picture of Christ dying on a cross for their sins?
Late in His ministry, “Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life” (Matthew 16:21-22).
“Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
What was the reaction of His disciples to this message?
‘Never, Lord!’ he said.
‘This shall never happen to you!’” Peter and the other disciples did not know the full truth, yet they were saved because they believed that God would take care of their sin problem.
They didn’t exactly know how He would accomplish that, any more than Adam, Abraham, Moses, or David knew how, but they believed God.
Today, we have more revelation than the people living before the resurrection of Christ; we know the full picture.
At that point that is all Adam knew, but he believed it.
“In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe” (Hebrews 1:1-2).
Our salvation is still based on the death of Christ, our faith is still the requirement for salvation, and the object of our faith is still God.
Today, for us, the content of our faith is that Jesus Christ died for our sins, He was buried, and He rose the third day (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).

 Congratulations!
You have made a life-changing decision!
Perhaps you are asking, “Now what?
How do I begin my journey with God?” The five steps mentioned below will give you direction from the Bible.
When you have questions on your journey, please visit www.GotQuestions.org.
1.
Make sure you understand salvation.
 First John 5:13 tells us, “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.” God wants us to understand salvation.
God wants us to have the confidence of knowing for sure that we are saved.
Briefly, let’s go over the key points of salvation:
 Ffena twayonoona.
Yesu yaffa ku Musaalaba okusasula omutango gw'ebibi byaffe(Abaruumi 5:8; 2 Abakolinso 5:21) Yesu yaffa mu kifo kyaffe, natwala ekibonerezo kyetwali tugwana.
Olw'ebibi byaffe , tugwaniira okubonerezebwa n'ekibonerezo eky'okwawukana ne Katonda emirembe gyonna.
Yesu yaffa ku Musaalaba okusasula omutango gw'ebibi byaffe(Abaruumi 5:8; 2 Abakolinso 5:21) Yesu yaffa mu kifo kyaffe, natwala ekibonerezo kyetwali tugwana.
Jesus died in our place, taking the punishment that we deserved.
Jesus’ resurrection proved that His death was sufficient to pay for our sins.
Katonda asonyiwa era alokola abo abateeka okukkiriza kwabwe  mu Yesu- nebakkiririza mu Kufakwe ng'omuwendo ogwasasulibwa kwe bibi bwaffe (Yokaana 3:16; Abaruumi 5:1; Abaruumi 8:1)

Olw'ebibi byaffe , tugwaniira okubonerezebwa n'ekibonerezo eky'okwawukana ne Katonda emirembe gyonna.
That is the message of salvation!
If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior, you are saved!
Katonda asonyiwa era alokola abo abateeka okukkiriza kwabwe  mu Yesu- nebakkiririza mu Kufakwe ng'omuwendo ogwasasulibwa kwe bibi bwaffe (Yokaana 3:16; Abaruumi 5:1; Abaruumi 8:1)
Katonda asonyiwa era alokola abo abateeka okukkiriza kwabwe  mu Yesu- nebakkiririza mu Kufakwe ng'omuwendo ogwasasulibwa kwe bibi bwaffe (Yokaana 3:16; Abaruumi 5:1; Abaruumi 8:1)
If you are trusting in Jesus alone as your Savior, you can have confidence that you will spend eternity with God in heaven!
2.
Find a good church that teaches the Bible.
 Don’t think of the church as a building.
The church is the  people.
It is very important that believers in Jesus Christ fellowship with one another.
That is one of the primary purposes of the church.
Now that you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ, we strongly encourage you to find a Bible-believing church in your area and speak to the pastor.
Let him know about your new faith in Jesus Christ.
A second purpose of the church is to teach the Bible.
You can learn how to apply God’s instructions to your life.
Understanding the Bible is key to living a successful and powerful Christian life.
2 Timothy 3:16-17 says, “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”
 A third purpose of the church is worship.
Worship is thanking God for all He has done!
God has saved us.
God loves us.
God provides for us.
God guides and directs us.
How could we not thank Him?
God is holy, righteous, loving, merciful, and full of grace.
Revelation 4:11 declares, “You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.”
 3.
Set aside time each day to focus on God.
 It is very important for us to spend time each day focusing  on God.
Some people call this a “quiet time.” Others call it  “devotions,” because it is a time when we devote ourselves to God.
Some prefer to set aside time in the mornings, while others prefer the evenings.
It does not matter what you call this time or when you do it.
What matters is that you regularly spend time with God.
What events make up our time with God?
Okusaba.
Prayer is simply talking to God.
Talk to God about your concerns and problems.
Ask God to give you wisdom and guidance.
Ask God to provide for your needs.
Tell God how much you love Him and how much you appreciate all He does for you.
Okusaba.
Okusoma Bayibuli.
In addition to being taught the Bible in church, Sunday School, and/or Bible studies – you need to be reading the Bible for yourself.
The Bible contains everything you need to know in order to live a successful Christian life.
It contains God’s guidance for how to make wise decisions, how to know God’s will, how to minister to others, and how to grow spiritually.
The Bible is God’s Word to us.
The Bible is essentially God’s instruction manual for how to live our lives in a way that is pleasing to Him and satisfying to us.
4.
Develop relationships with people who can help you spiritually.
 1 Corinthians 15:33 tells us, “Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character.’” The Bible is full of warnings about the influence “bad” people can have on us.
Spending time with those who engage in sinful activities will cause us to be tempted by those activities.
The character of those we are around will “rub off” on us.
That is why it is so important to surround ourselves with other people who love the Lord and are committed to Him.
Try to find a friend or two, perhaps from your church, who can help you and encourage you (Hebrews 3:13; 10:24).
Ask your friends to keep you accountable in regard to your quiet time, your activities, and your walk with God.
Ask if you can do the same for them.
This does not mean you have to give up all your friends who do not know the Lord Jesus as their Savior.
Continue to be their friend and love them.
Simply let them know that Jesus has changed your life and you cannot do all the same things you used to do.
Ask God to give you opportunities to share Jesus with your friends.
5.
Be baptized.
 Many people have a misunderstanding of baptism.
The word baptize means “to immerse in water.” Baptism is the biblical way of publicly proclaiming your new faith in Christ and your commitment to follow Him.
The action of being immersed in the water illustrates being buried with Christ.
The action of coming out of the water pictures Christ’s resurrection.
Being baptized is identifying yourself with Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection (Romans 6:3-4).
I am a new Christian.

 Questions about the Christian Life
                                                                                         Answer
 The most frequent objection to the doctrine of eternal security is that it supposedly allows people to live any way that they want and still be saved.
While this may be “technically” true, it is not true in reality.
A person who has truly been redeemed by Jesus Christ will not live a life characterized by continuous, willful sin.
We must draw a distinction between how a Christian should live and what a person must do in order to receive salvation.
The Bible is clear that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone (John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8-9; John 14:6).
The moment a person truly believes in Jesus Christ, he or she is saved and secure in that salvation.
The apostle Paul addresses this issue in Galatians 3:3 when he asks, “Are you so foolish?
After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort?” If we are saved by faith, our salvation is also maintained and secured by faith.
We cannot earn our own salvation.
It is God who maintains our salvation (Jude 24).
It is God who maintains our salvation (Jude 24).
It is God’s love that nothing can separate us from (Romans 8:38-39).
Jesus’ death was absolutely sufficient to pay for all of our sins—past, present, and future, pre-salvation and post-salvation (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Any denial of eternal security is, in its essence, a belief that we must maintain our own salvation by our own good works and efforts.
This is completely antithetical to salvation by grace.
To claim that we must obey God’s Word or live a godly life to maintain our salvation is saying that Jesus’ death was not sufficient to pay the penalty for our sins.

Jesus’ death was absolutely sufficient to pay for all of our sins—past, present, and future, pre-salvation and post-salvation (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Does this mean that a Christian can live any way he wants to and still be saved?
This is essentially a hypothetical question, because the Bible makes it clear that a true Christian will not live “any way he wants to.” Christians are new creations (2 Corinthians 5:17).
Christians demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23), not the acts of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21).
Christians demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23), not the acts of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21).
In response to the accusation that grace promotes sin, the apostle Paul declared, “What shall we say, then?
Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?
By no means!
We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?” (Romans 6:1-2).
Eternal security is not a license to sin.
Rather, it is the security of knowing that God’s love is guaranteed for those who trust in Christ.
Knowing and understanding God’s tremendous gift of salvation accomplishes the opposite of giving a license to sin.
How could anyone, knowing the price Jesus Christ paid for us, go on to live a life of sin (Romans 6:15-23)?
Rather, it is the security of knowing that God’s love is guaranteed for those who trust in Christ.
Such a person is demonstrating not that eternal security has given him a license to sin, but rather that he or she has not truly experienced salvation through Jesus Christ.
No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him” (1 John 3:6).

 The Bible does not specifically condemn gambling, betting, or the lottery.
The Bible does warn us, however, to stay away from the love of money (1 Timothy 6:10; Hebrews 13:5).
What is wrong with gambling?
Gambling is a difficult issue because if it is done in moderation and only on occasion, it is a waste of money, but it is not necessarily evil.
People waste money on all sorts of activities.
Gambling is no more or less of a waste of money than seeing a movie (in many cases), eating an unnecessarily expensive meal, or purchasing a worthless item.
At the same time, the fact that money is wasted on other things does not justify gambling.
Money should not be wasted.
Excess money should be saved for future needs or given to the Lord’s work, not gambled away.
While the Bible does not explicitly mention gambling, it does mention events of “luck” or “chance.” As an example, casting lots is used in Leviticus to choose between the sacrificial goat and the scapegoat.
While the Bible does not explicitly mention gambling, it does mention events of “luck” or “chance.” As an example, casting lots is used in Leviticus to choose between the sacrificial goat and the scapegoat.
Nehemiah cast lots to determine who would live inside the walls of Jerusalem.
The apostles cast lots to determine the replacement for Judas.
Proverbs 16:33 says, “The lot is cast in the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.”
 What would the Bible say about casinos and lotteries?
Casinos use all sorts of marketing schemes to entice gamblers to risk as much money as possible.
They often offer inexpensive or even free alcohol, which encourages drunkenness, and thereby a decreased ability to make wise decisions.
Everything in a casino is perfectly rigged for taking money in large sums and giving nothing in return, except for fleeting and empty pleasures.
While the Bible does not explicitly mention gambling, it does mention events of “luck” or “chance.” As an example, casting lots is used in Leviticus to choose between the sacrificial goat and the scapegoat.
However, studies show that lottery participants are usually those who can least afford to be spending money on lottery tickets.
The allure of “getting rich quick” is too great a temptation to resist for those who are desperate.
The chances of winning are infinitesimal, which results in many peoples’ lives being ruined.
Can lotto/lottery proceeds please God?
Many people claim to be playing the lottery or gambling so that they can give the money to the church or to some other good cause.
While this may be a good motive, reality is that few use gambling winnings for godly purposes.
Studies show that the vast majority of lottery winners are in an even worse financial situation a few years after winning a jackpot than they were before.
Further, God does not need our money to fund His mission in the world.
Proverbs 13:11 says, “Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow.” God is sovereign and will provide for the needs of the church through honest means.
Further, God does not need our money to fund His mission in the world.
Would God be honored by receiving donated drug money or money stolen in a bank robbery?
Of course not.
Neither does God need or want money that was “stolen” from the poor in the temptation for riches.
Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” Hebrews 13:5 declares, “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’” Matthew 6:24 proclaims, “No one can serve two masters.

 We know that God is real because He has revealed Himself to us in three ways: in creation, in His Word, and in His Son, Jesus Christ.
The most basic proof of God’s existence is simply what He has made.
“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse” (Romans 1:20).
“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.” (Psalm 19:1).
                                                                                         Answer
If I found a wristwatch in the middle of a field, I would not assume that it just “appeared” out of nowhere or that it had always existed.
Based on the watch’s design, I would assume it had a designer.
But there is far greater design and precision in the world around us.
Our measurement of time is not based on wristwatches, but on God’s handiwork—the regular rotation of the earth (and the radioactive properties of the cesium-133 atom).
The universe displays great design, and this argues for a Great Designer.
Not only has God made an intricate and finely tuned physical world; He has also instilled a sense of eternity in the heart of every person (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
Mankind has an innate perception that there is more to life than meets the eye, that there is an existence higher than this earthly routine.
Our sense of eternity manifests itself in at least two ways: law-making and worship.
Every civilization throughout history has valued certain moral laws, which are surprisingly similar from culture to culture.
For example, the ideal of love is universally esteemed, while the act of lying is universally condemned.
This common morality—this global understanding of right and wrong—points to a Supreme Moral Being who gave us such scruples.
In the same way, people all over the world, regardless of culture, have always cultivated a system of worship.
The object of worship may vary, but the sense of a “higher power” is an undeniable part of being human.
Our propensity to worship accords with the fact that God created us “in His own image” (Genesis 1:27).
God has also revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible.
Throughout Scripture, the existence of God is treated as a self-evident fact (Genesis 1:1; Exodus 3:14).
Likewise, God does not spend much time proving His existence in His book.
The life-changing nature of the Bible, its integrity, and the miracles which accompanied its writing should be enough to warrant a closer look.
The third way in which God revealed Himself is through His Son, Jesus Christ (John 14:6-11).
“In the beginning was the Word: the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
Throughout Scripture, the existence of God is treated as a self-evident fact (Genesis 1:1; Exodus 3:14).
In Jesus’ amazing life, He kept the entire Old Testament law perfectly and fulfilled the prophecies concerning the Messiah (Matthew 5:17).
He performed countless acts of compassion and public miracles to authenticate His message and bear witness to His deity (John 21:24-25).
Then, three days after His crucifixion, He rose from the dead, a fact affirmed by hundreds of eyewitnesses (1 Corinthians 15:6).
Then, three days after His crucifixion, He rose from the dead, a fact affirmed by hundreds of eyewitnesses (1 Corinthians 15:6).
The historical record abounds with “proof” of who Jesus is.
As the Apostle Paul said, this thing “was not done in a corner” (Acts 26:26).
We realize that there will always be skeptics who have their own ideas concerning God and will read the evidence accordingly.
And there will be some whom no amount of proof will convince (Psalm 14:1).
It all comes down to faith (Hebrews 11:6).

 Some who deny that Jesus is God make the claim that Jesus never said that He is God.
It is correct that the Bible never records Jesus saying the precise words, “I am God.” This does not mean, however, that Jesus never claimed to be God.
Is Jesus God?
— Jesus claimed to be God.
 Take for example the words of Jesus in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” We need only to look at the Jews’ reaction to His statement to know He was claiming to be God.
They tried to stone Him for this very reason: “You, a mere man, claim to be God” (John 10:33, emphasis added).
The Jews understood exactly what Jesus was claiming—deity.
When Jesus declared, “I and the Father are one,” He was saying that He and the Father are of one nature and essence.
John 8:58 is another example.
Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth … before Abraham was born, I am!” This is a reference back to Exodus 3:14 when God revealed Himself as the “I AM.” The Jews who heard this statement responded by taking up stones to kill Him for blasphemy, as the Mosaic Law commanded (Leviticus 24:16).
Is Jesus God?
— His followers declared Him to be God.
 John reiterates the concept of Jesus’ deity: “The Word [Jesus] was God” and “the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14).
These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh.
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Jesus Christ.
And this same verse declares that God purchased His church with His own blood.
Therefore, Jesus is God.
Thomas the disciple declared concerning Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28).
Jesus does not correct him.
Titus 2:13 encourages us to wait for the coming of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ (see also 2 Peter 1:1).
In Hebrews 1:8, the Father declares of Jesus, “But about the Son He says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.’” The Father refers to Jesus as God, indicating that Jesus is indeed God.
In Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10).
Several times in Scripture Jesus receives worship (Matthew 2:11; 14:33; 28:9, 17; Luke 24:52; John 9:38).
He never rebukes people for worshiping Him.
If Jesus were not God, He would have told people to not worship Him, just as the angel in Revelation did.
Beyond these, there are many other passages of Scripture that argue for Jesus being God.
Is Jesus God?
— The reason Jesus must be God.
 The most important reason that Jesus must be God is that, if He is not God, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).
A created being, which Jesus would be if He were not God, could not pay the infinite penalty required for sin against an infinite God.
Only God could pay such an infinite penalty.
Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death.
Is Jesus God?
Yes.
Jesus declared Himself to be God.
His followers believed Him to be God.
The provision of salvation only works if Jesus is God.
Jesus is God incarnate, the eternal Alpha and Omega (Revelation 1:8; 22:13), and God our Savior (2 Peter 1:1).

                                                                                         Answer
Yes, when people come to know Christ as their Savior, they are brought into a relationship with God that guarantees their salvation as eternally secure.
To be clear, salvation is more than saying a prayer or “making a decision” for Christ; salvation is a sovereign act of God whereby an unregenerate sinner is washed, renewed, and born again by the Holy Spirit (John 3:3; Titus 3:5).
To be clear, salvation is more than saying a prayer or “making a decision” for Christ; salvation is a sovereign act of God whereby an unregenerate sinner is washed, renewed, and born again by the Holy Spirit (John 3:3; Titus 3:5).
The Spirit will cause the saved person to walk in obedience to God’s Word (Ezekiel 36:26–27; James 2:26).
Numerous passages of Scripture declare the fact that, as an act of God, salvation is secure:
  (a) Romans 8:30 declares, "And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified."
This verse tells us that from the moment God chooses us, it is as if we are glorified in His presence in heaven.
There is nothing that can prevent a believer from one day being glorified because God has already purposed it in heaven.
Once a person is justified, his salvation is guaranteed—he is as secure as if he is already glorified in heaven.
(b) Paul asks two crucial questions in Romans 8:33-34 "Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
It is God who justifies.
Christ Jesus, who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us."
Who will bring a charge against God’s elect?
No one will, because Christ is our advocate.
Who will condemn us?
No one will, because Christ, the One who died for us, is the one who condemns.
We have both the advocate and judge as our Savior.
(c) Believers are born again (regenerated) when they believe (John 3:3; Titus 3:5).
The Bible gives no evidence that the new birth can be taken away.
(d) The Holy Spirit indwells all believers (John 14:17; Romans 8:9) and baptizes all believers into the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13).
(e) John 3:15 states that whoever believes in Jesus Christ will "have eternal life."
Hence, if you lose your salvation, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in error.
(f) In a conclusive argument, Scripture says, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 8:38–39).
Remember the same God who saved you is the same God who will keep you.
Our salvation is most definitely eternally secure!

 This is perhaps the most important question in all of Christian theology.
This question is the cause of the Reformation, the split between the Protestant churches and Catholic Church.
This question is a key difference between biblical Christianity and most of the “Christian” cults.
Is salvation by faith alone, or by faith plus works?
Am I saved just by believing in Jesus, or do I have to believe in Jesus and do certain things?
The question of faith alone or faith plus works is made difficult by some hard-to-reconcile Bible passages.
Compare Romans 3:28, 5:1 and Galatians 3:24 with James 2:24.
Some see a difference between Paul (salvation is by faith alone) and James (salvation is by faith plus works).
Paul dogmatically says that justification is by faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9), while James appears to be saying that justification is by faith plus works.
This apparent problem is answered by examining what exactly James is talking about.
James is refuting the belief that a person can have faith without producing any good works (James 2:17-18).
James is emphasizing the point that genuine faith in Christ will produce a changed life and good works (James 2:20-26).
James is not saying that justification is by faith plus works, but rather that a person who is truly justified by faith will have good works in his/her life.
If a person claims to be a believer, but has no good works in his/her life, then he/she likely does not have genuine faith in Christ (James 2:14, 17, 20, 26).
Paul says the same thing in his writings.
The good fruit believers should have in their lives is listed in Galatians 5:22-23.
Immediately after telling us that we are saved by faith, not works (Ephesians 2:8-9), Paul informs us that we were created to do good works (Ephesians 2:10).
Paul simply emphasized that justification is by faith alone while James put emphasis on the fact that genuine faith in Christ produces good works.
Paul expects just as much of a changed life as James does: “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
Paul expects just as much of a changed life as James does: “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
James and Paul do not disagree in their teaching regarding salvation.
They approach the same subject from different perspectives.
Paul simply emphasized that justification is by faith alone while James put emphasis on the fact that genuine faith in Christ produces good works.

Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.” While the Bible was completed approximately 1900 years ago, its accuracy and relevance for today remain unchanged.
The Bible is the sole objective source of all the revelation God has given us about Himself and His plan for humanity.
The Bible contains a great deal of information about the natural world that has been confirmed by scientific observations and research.
                                                                                         Answer
Some of these passages include Leviticus 17:11; Ecclesiastes 1:6-7; Job 36:27-29; Psalm 102:25-27 and Colossians 1:16-17.
As the Bible’s story of God’s redemptive plan for humanity unfolds, many different characters are vividly described.
In those descriptions, the Bible provides a great deal of information about human behavior and tendencies.
Our own day-to-day experience shows us that this information is more accurate and descriptive of the human condition than any psychology textbook.
Many historical facts recorded in the Bible have been confirmed by extra-biblical sources.
Historical research often shows a great deal of agreement between biblical accounts and extra-biblical accounts of the same events.
However, the Bible is not a history book, a psychology text, or a scientific journal.
The Bible is the description God gave us about who He is, and His desires and plans for humanity.
The most significant component of this revelation is the story of our separation from God by sin and God’s provision for restoration of fellowship through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ, on the cross.
Our need for redemption does not change.
Neither does God’s desire to reconcile us to Himself.
The Bible contains a great deal of accurate and relevant information.
The Bible contains a great deal of accurate and relevant information.
The Bible’s most important message—redemption—is universally and perpetually applicable to humanity.
God’s Word will never be outdated, superseded, or improved upon.
Cultures change, laws change, generations come and go, but the Word of God is as relevant today as it was when it was first written.
Not all of Scripture necessarily applies explicitly to us today, but all Scriptures contain truth that we can, and should, apply to our lives today.

 Our answer to this question will not only determine how we view the Bible and its importance to our lives, but also it will ultimately have an eternal impact on us.
If the Bible is truly God’s Word, then we should cherish it, study it, obey it, and fully trust it.
If the Bible is the Word of God, then to dismiss it is to dismiss God Himself.
The fact that God gave us the Bible is an evidence and illustration of His love for us.
The term “revelation” simply means that God communicated to mankind what He is like and how we can have a right relationship with Him.
These are things that we could not have known had God not divinely revealed them to us in the Bible.
Although God’s revelation of Himself in the Bible was given progressively over approximately 1500 years, it has always contained everything man needs to know about God in order to have a right relationship with Him.
If the Bible is truly the Word of God, then it is the final authority for all matters of faith, religious practice, and morals.
The question we must ask ourselves is how can we know that the Bible is the Word of God and not just a good book?
What is unique about the Bible that sets it apart from all other religious books ever written?
Is there any evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word?
These types of questions must be seriously examined if we are to determine the validity of the Bible’s claim to be the very Word of God, divinely inspired, and totally sufficient for all matters of faith and practice.
There can be no doubt that the Bible does claim to be the very Word of God.
This is clearly seen in Paul’s commendation to Timothy: “… from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
This is clearly seen in Paul’s commendation to Timothy: “… from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
Other prophecies concern the coming of One who would be the Messiah, the Savior of all who would believe in Him.
All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:15-17).
There are both internal and external evidences that the Bible is truly God’s Word.
There are also external evidences that indicate the Bible is truly the Word of God.
One of the first internal evidences that the Bible is truly God’s Word is seen in its unity.
Even though it is really sixty-six individual books, written on three continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years, by more than 40 authors who came from many walks of life, the Bible remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction.
This unity is unique from all other books and is evidence of the divine origin of the words which God moved men to record.
Another of the internal evidences that indicates the Bible is truly God’s Word is the prophecies contained within its pages.
The Bible contains hundreds of detailed prophecies relating to the future of individual nations including Israel, certain cities, and mankind.
Unlike the prophecies found in other religious books or those by men such as Nostradamus, biblical prophecies are extremely detailed.
There are over three hundred prophecies concerning Jesus Christ in the Old Testament.
Not only was it foretold where He would be born and His lineage, but also how He would die and that He would rise again.
Other prophecies concern the coming of One who would be the Messiah, the Savior of all who would believe in Him.
There is no other religious book with the extent or type of predictive prophecy that the Bible contains.
Another external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the integrity of its human authors.
As mentioned earlier, God used men from many walks of life to record His words.
In studying the lives of these men, we find them to be honest and sincere.
The fact that they were willing to die often excruciating deaths for what they believed testifies that these ordinary yet honest men truly believed God had spoken to them.
The men who wrote the New Testament and many hundreds of other believers (1 Corinthians 15:6) knew the truth of their message because they had seen and spent time with Jesus Christ after He had risen from the dead.
They went from hiding in fear to being willing to die for the message God had revealed to them.
Seeing the risen Christ had a tremendous impact on them.
They went from hiding in fear to being willing to die for the message God had revealed to them.
Their lives and deaths testify to the fact that the Bible truly is God’s Word.
A final external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the indestructibility of the Bible.
Because of its importance and its claim to be the very Word of God, the Bible has suffered more vicious attacks and attempts to destroy it than any other book in history.
From early Roman Emperors like Diocletian, through communist dictators and on to modern-day atheists and agnostics, the Bible has withstood and outlasted all of its attackers and is still today the most widely published book in the world.
Throughout time, skeptics have regarded the Bible as mythological, but archeology has confirmed it as historical.
Opponents have attacked its teaching as primitive and outdated, but its moral and legal concepts and teachings have had a positive influence on societies and cultures throughout the world.
It continues to be attacked by pseudo-science, psychology, and political movements, yet it remains just as true and relevant today as it was when it was first written.
It is a book that has transformed countless lives and cultures throughout the last 2000 years.
The accuracy which has been preserved despite every attempt to corrupt, attack, or destroy it is clear testimony to the fact that the Bible is truly God’s Word and is supernaturally protected by Him.
It should not surprise us that, no matter how the Bible is attacked, it always comes out unchanged and unscathed.
After all, Jesus said, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Mark 13:31).
After all, Jesus said, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Mark 13:31).
After looking at the evidence, one can say without a doubt that, yes, the Bible is truly God’s Word.

 In addition to Jesus’ specific claims about Himself, His disciples also acknowledged the deity of Christ.
They claimed that Jesus had the right to forgive sins—something only God can do—as it is God who is offended by sin (Acts 5:31; Colossians 3:13; Psalm 130:4; Jeremiah 31:34).
In close connection with this last claim, Jesus is also said to be the one who will “judge the living and the dead” (2 Timothy 4:1).
Thomas cried out to Jesus, “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28).
Paul calls Jesus “great God and Savior” (Titus 2:13) and points out that prior to His incarnation Jesus existed in the “form of God” (Philippians 2:5-8).
God the Father says regarding Jesus: “Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever” (Hebrews 1:8).
John states that “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word [Jesus] was God” (John 1:1).
Examples of Scriptures that teach the deity of Christ are many (see Revelation 1:17, 2:8, 22:13; 1 Corinthians 10:4; 1 Peter 2:6-8; Psalm 18:2, 95:1; 1 Peter 5:4; Hebrews 13:20), but even one of these is enough to show that Christ was considered to be God by His followers.
Jesus is also given titles that are unique to YHWH (the formal name of God) in the Old Testament.
The Old Testament title “redeemer” (Psalm 130:7; Hosea 13:14) is used of Jesus in the New Testament (Titus 2:13; Revelation 5:9).
Jesus is called Immanuel—“God with us”—in Matthew 1.
In Zechariah 12:10, it is YHWH who says, “They will look on me, the one they have pierced.” But the New Testament applies this to Jesus’ crucifixion (John 19:37; Revelation 1:7).
If it is YHWH who is pierced and looked upon, and Jesus was the one pierced and looked upon, then Jesus is YHWH.
Paul interprets Isaiah 45:22-23 as applying to Jesus in Philippians 2:10-11.
Further, Jesus’ name is used alongside God’s in prayer “Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (Galatians 1:3; Ephesians 1:2).
This would be blasphemy if Christ were not deity.
The name of Jesus appears with God’s in Jesus’ commanded to baptize “in the name [singular] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19; see also 2 Corinthians 13:14).
Actions that can be accomplished only by God are credited to Jesus.
Jesus not only raised the dead (John 5:21, 11:38-44) and forgave sins (Acts 5:31, 13:38), He created and sustains the universe (John 1:2; Colossians 1:16-17).
This becomes even clearer when one considers YHWH said He was alone during creation (Isaiah 44:24).
Further, Christ possesses attributes that only deity can have: eternality (John 8:58), omnipresence (Matthew 18:20, 28:20), omniscience (Matthew 16:21), and omnipotence (John 11:38-44).
Now, it is one thing to claim to be God or to fool someone into believing it is true, and something else entirely to prove it to be so.
Christ offered many miracles as proof of His claim to deity.
Just a few of Jesus’ miracles include turning water to wine (John 2:7), walking on water (Matthew 14:25), multiplying physical objects (John 6:11), healing the blind (John 9:7), the lame (Mark 2:3), and the sick (Matthew 9:35; Mark 1:40-42), and even raising people from the dead (John 11:43-44; Luke 7:11-15; Mark 5:35).
Moreover, Christ Himself rose from the dead.
Far from the so-called dying and rising gods of pagan mythology, nothing like the resurrection is seriously claimed by other religions, and no other claim has as much extra-scriptural confirmation.
There are at least twelve historical facts about Jesus that even non-Christian critical scholars will admit:
            12.
Paul, an enemy of Christianity, was converted by an experience which he believed to be an appearance of the risen Jesus.
Even if someone were to object to this specific list, only a few are needed to prove the resurrection and establish the gospel: Jesus’ death, burial, resurrection, and appearances (1 Corinthians 15:1-5).
While there may be some theories to explain one or two of the above facts, only the resurrection explains and accounts for them all.
Critics admit that the disciples claimed they saw the risen Jesus.
Neither lies nor hallucinations can transform people the way the resurrection did.
First, what would they have had to gain?
Christianity was not popular and it certainly did not make them any money.
Second, liars do not make good martyrs.
There is no better explanation than the resurrection for the disciples’ willingness to die horrible deaths for their faith.
Yes, many people die for lies that they think are true, but people do not die for what they know is untrue.
In conclusion, Christ claimed He was YHWH, that He was deity (not just “a god” but the one true God); His followers (Jews who would have been terrified of idolatry) believed Him and referred to Him as God.
Christ proved His claims to deity through miracles, including the world-altering resurrection.
No other hypothesis can explain these facts.
Yes, the deity of Christ is biblical.

All of us have been challenged by this question.
 Job, speaking out of his despair, asked, “If a man dies, shall he live again?” (Job 14:14, ESV).

Does everyone go to the same place after death, or do we go to different places?
Is there really a heaven and hell?
At death, the body ceases to function and begins the process of returning to the earth, but the spiritual part of man lives on: “The dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7; cf.

To those who are redeemed and have their sin forgiven, God gives eternal life, an existence so glorious that “no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9, NLT).
This eternal life is inextricably linked to the Person of Jesus Christ: “Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent” (John 17:3).
Jesus Christ, God incarnate, came to the earth to pay for our sins and give us the gift of eternal life: “He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).
Three days after His crucifixion, Jesus proved Himself victorious over death by rising from the grave—He is life personified (John 11:25) and the ultimate proof that there is life after death.

The resurrection of the Christ is a well-documented event.
The apostle Paul invited people to question the over 500 eyewitnesses who saw Jesus after His resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:6).
The resurrection of Christ, which gives us the sure hope of life after death, is the cornerstone of the Christian faith (1 Corinthians 15:12–19).
Because Christ was raised from the dead, we have faith that we, too, will be resurrected.
The resurrection of Christ, which gives us the sure hope of life after death, is the cornerstone of the Christian faith (1 Corinthians 15:12–19).
Christ was only the first of a great harvest of those who will be raised to life again (1 Corinthians 15:23).
The fact of life after death does not mean everyone will go to heaven, however.
Just as God raised up Jesus’ body, so will our bodies be resurrected upon Jesus’ return (1 Corinthians 6:14).
Just as God raised up Jesus’ body, so will our bodies be resurrected upon Jesus’ return (1 Corinthians 6:14).
The fact of life after death does not mean everyone will go to heaven, however.
Each person must make a choice in this life, a choice that will determine his or her eternal destination.
It is appointed for us to die once, and after that will come judgment (Hebrews 9:27).
Those who have been made righteous by faith in Christ will go into eternal life in heaven, but those who have rejected Christ as Savior will be sent to eternal punishment in hell (Matthew 25:46).
Hell, like heaven, is a literal place.
It is a place where the unrighteous will experience the never-ending, eternal wrath of God.
Hell is described as a lake of fire where the inhabitants will be tormented day and night forever and ever (Revelation 20:10).
In hell, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, indicating intense grief and anger (Matthew 13:42).
God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked but desires them to turn from their wicked ways so that they can live (Ezekiel 33:11).
In hell, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, indicating intense grief and anger (Matthew 13:42).
But He will not force us into submission; if we choose to reject Christ, the one and only Savior, we reject the heaven that He has prepared, and we will live eternally apart from Him.
But He will not force us into submission; if we choose to reject Christ, the one and only Savior, we reject the heaven that He has prepared, and we will live eternally apart from Him.
Life on earth is a preparation for what is to come.
For unbelievers, life after death is eternity in the lake of fire.
For unbelievers, life after death is eternity in the lake of fire.
How can we receive eternal life and avoid hell?
There is only one way—through faith in Jesus Christ.
Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life.
The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die” (John 11:25–26).
The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die” (John 11:25–26).
The free gift of eternal life is available to all.
“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them” (John 3:36).
“I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation” (2 Corinthians 6:2).
We will not be given the opportunity to accept God’s gift of salvation after death.
Our eternal destination is determined in our earthly lifetimes by our reception or rejection of Jesus Christ.
“I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation” (2 Corinthians 6:2).
If we trust in the death of Jesus Christ as the full payment for our sin, and we believe in His resurrection from the dead, we are guaranteed eternal life after death, in glory (1 Peter 1:3–5).

 Scripture presents conclusive evidence that Jesus Christ was in fact resurrected from the dead.
Christ’s resurrection is recorded in Matthew 28:1-20; Mark 16:1-20; Luke 24:1-53; and John 20:1–21:25.
The resurrected Christ also appeared in the Book of Acts (Acts 1:1-11).
From these passages you can gain several “proofs” of Christ’s resurrection.
First is the dramatic change in the disciples.
They went from a group of men frightened and in hiding to strong, courageous witnesses sharing the gospel throughout the world.
What else could explain this dramatic change other than the risen Christ appearing to them?
Second is the life of the apostle Paul.
What changed him from being a persecutor of the church into an apostle for the church?
It was when the risen Christ appeared to him on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1-6).
A third convincing proof is the empty tomb.
If Christ were not raised, then where is His body?
The disciples and others saw the tomb where He was buried.
When they returned, His body was not there.
When they returned, His body was not there.
Angels declared that He had been raised from the dead as He had promised (Matthew 28:5-7).
Fourth, additional evidence of His resurrection is the many people He appeared to (Matthew 28:5, 9, 16-17; Mark 16:9; Luke 24:13-35; John 20:19, 24, 26-29, 21:1-14; Acts 1:6-8; 1 Corinthians 15:5-7).
Fourth, additional evidence of His resurrection is the many people He appeared to (Matthew 28:5, 9, 16-17; Mark 16:9; Luke 24:13-35; John 20:19, 24, 26-29, 21:1-14; Acts 1:6-8; 1 Corinthians 15:5-7).
Another proof of the resurrection of Jesus is the great amount of weight the apostles gave to Jesus’ resurrection.
A key passage on Christ’s resurrection is 1 Corinthians 15.
In this chapter, the apostle Paul explains why it is crucial to understand and believe in Christ’s resurrection.
If He had simply died and stayed dead, that would indicate His sacrifice was not sufficient.
2) If Christ was not raised from the dead, His sacrifice for sin was not sufficient (1 Corinthians 15:16-19).
If He had simply died and stayed dead, that would indicate His sacrifice was not sufficient.
As a result, believers would not be forgiven for their sins, and they would remain dead after they die (1 Corinthians 15:16-19).
There would be no such thing as eternal life (John 3:16).
There would be no such thing as eternal life (John 3:16).
“But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20 NAS).
It proclaims that, as a result of Christ’s resurrection, all who believe in Him have ultimate victory over death (1 Corinthians 15:50-58).
First Corinthians 15 goes on to describe how Christ’s resurrection proves His victory over sin and provides us the power to live victoriously over sin (1 Corinthians 15:24-34).
It describes the glorious nature of the resurrection body we will receive (1 Corinthians 15:35-49).
It proclaims that, as a result of Christ’s resurrection, all who believe in Him have ultimate victory over death (1 Corinthians 15:50-58).
Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain” (1 Corinthians 15:58).
According to the Bible, the resurrection of Jesus Christ is most definitely true.
Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain” (1 Corinthians 15:58).
The Bible records Christ’s resurrection, records that over 500 people witnessed the resurrected Christ, and proceeds to build crucial Christian doctrine on the historical fact of Jesus’ resurrection.

 The Bible does not mention masturbation or state whether or not masturbation is a sin.
The passage most frequently associated with masturbation is the story of Onan in Genesis 38:9–10.
Some interpret this passage to say that “spilling your seed” is a sin.
However, that is not what the passage is saying.
God condemned Onan not for “spilling his seed” but because Onan was rebellious.
Onan refused to fulfill his duty to provide an heir for his deceased brother.
The passage is not about masturbation but about fulfilling a family obligation.
A second passage sometimes used as evidence that masturbation is a sin is Matthew 5:27–30.
Jesus speaks against having lustful thoughts and then says, “If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.” While there is clearly a connection between lustful thoughts and masturbation, it is unlikely that Jesus was alluding to the specific sin of masturbation in this passage.
The Bible nowhere explicitly states that masturbation is a sin, but there is no question that the actions that usually lead to masturbation are sinful.
Masturbation is nearly always the result of lustful thoughts, inappropriate sexual stimulation, and/or pornography.
It is these problems that need to be dealt with.
If the sins of lust, immoral thoughts, and pornography are forsaken and overcome, masturbation will become much less of an issue and temptation.
Many people struggle with guilt concerning masturbation, when, in reality, they would be far better off repenting of the sins that lead them to masturbate.
With that said, is masturbation itself a sin?
While the Bible does not directly answer this question, there definitely are some biblical principles that can be applied to the issue:
.
 (1) “So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31).
Therefore, honor God with your body” (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).
If we cannot give God glory for something, we should not do it.
.
(2) “Everything that does not come from faith is sin” (Romans 14:23).
If done with absolutely no lust, immoral thoughts, or pornography, with full assurance that it is good and right, with thanks given to God for the pleasure it brings (see 1 Corinthians 10:30), is it still a sin to masturbate?
.
(3) “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?
You are not your own; you were bought at a price.
Therefore, honor God with your body” (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).
Our bodies have been redeemed and belong to God.
These great truths should have a powerful impact on what we do with our bodies.
In light of these principles, many conclude that masturbation is always sinful.
Masturbation is a questionable activity, at best—whether it can glorify God; whether it can be done in absolute confidence that it is right; and whether it can honor God as the owner of our bodies.
If done with absolutely no lust, immoral thoughts, or pornography, with full assurance that it is good and right, with thanks given to God for the pleasure it brings (see 1 Corinthians 10:30), is it still a sin to masturbate?
The most we can say is maybe not.
However, we have serious doubts whether this scenario ever truly exists.

 The Bible does not explicitly state on which day of the week Jesus was crucified.
The two most widely held views are Friday and Wednesday.
One of the principal arguments for Friday is found in Mark 15:42, which notes that Jesus was crucified “the day before the Sabbath.” If that was the weekly Sabbath, i.e.
Jesus said in Matthew 12:40, “For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” Those who argue for a Friday crucifixion say that there is still a valid way in which He could have been considered in the grave for three days.
In the Jewish mind of the first century, a part of day was considered as a full day.
Since Jesus was in the grave for part of Friday, all of Saturday, and part of Sunday—He could be considered to have been in the grave for three days.
Since Jesus was in the grave for part of Friday, all of Saturday, and part of Sunday—He could be considered to have been in the grave for three days.
One of the principal arguments for Friday is found in Mark 15:42, which notes that Jesus was crucified “the day before the Sabbath.” If that was the weekly Sabbath, i.e.
But while some translations use “on the third day” for these verses, not all do, and not everyone agrees that “on the third day” is the best way to translate these verses.
Furthermore, Mark 8:31 says that Jesus will be raised “after” three days.
The Thursday argument expands on the Friday view and argues mainly that there are too many events (some count as many as twenty) happening between Christ’s burial and Sunday morning to occur from Friday evening to Sunday morning.
Proponents of the Thursday view point out that this is especially a problem when the only full day between Friday and Sunday was Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.
An extra day or two eliminates that problem.
The next time you see him it is Thursday morning and you say, “I haven’t seen you in three days” even though it had technically only been 60 hours (2.5 days).
If Jesus was crucified on Thursday, this example shows how it could be considered three days.

The next time you see him it is Thursday morning and you say, “I haven’t seen you in three days” even though it had technically only been 60 hours (2.5 days).
After the first one (the one that occurred on the evening of the crucifixion [Mark 15:42; Luke 23:52-54]), the women purchased spices—note that they made their purchase after the Sabbath (Mark 16:1).
The Wednesday view holds that this “Sabbath” was the Passover (see Leviticus 16:29-31, 23:24-32, 39, where high holy days that are not necessarily the seventh day of the week are referred to as the Sabbath).
The second Sabbath that week was the normal weekly Sabbath.
Note that in Luke 23:56 the women who had purchased spices after the first Sabbath returned and prepared the spices, then “rested on the Sabbath.” The argument states that they could not purchase the spices after the Sabbath, yet prepare those spices before the Sabbath—unless there were two Sabbaths.
With the two-Sabbath view, if Christ was crucified on Thursday, then the high holy Sabbath (the Passover) would have begun Thursday at sundown and ended at Friday sundown—at the beginning of the weekly Sabbath or Saturday.
The second Sabbath that week was the normal weekly Sabbath.
Purchasing the spices after the first Sabbath (Passover) would have meant they purchased them on Saturday and were breaking the Sabbath.
Therefore, according to the Wednesday viewpoint, the only explanation that does not violate the biblical account of the women and the spices and holds to a literal understanding of Matthew 12:40 is that Christ was crucified on Wednesday.
The Sabbath that was a high holy day (Passover) occurred on Thursday, the women purchased spices (after that) on Friday and returned and prepared the spices on the same day, they rested on Saturday which was the weekly Sabbath, then brought the spices to the tomb early Sunday.
Jesus was buried near sundown on Wednesday, which began Thursday in the Jewish calendar.
Thursday night (night one), Friday day (day two), Friday night (night two), Saturday day (day three), Saturday night (night three).
Thursday night (night one), Friday day (day two), Friday night (night two), Saturday day (day three), Saturday night (night three).
We do not know exactly what time He rose, but we do know that it was before sunrise on Sunday.
He could have risen as early as just after sunset Saturday evening, which began the first day of the week to the Jews.
The discovery of the empty tomb was made just at sunrise (Mark 16:2), before it was fully light (John 20:1).
The discovery of the empty tomb was made just at sunrise (Mark 16:2), before it was fully light (John 20:1).
A possible problem with the Wednesday view is that the disciples who walked with Jesus on the road to Emmaus did so on “the same day” of His resurrection (Luke 24:13).
The disciples, who do not recognize Jesus, tell Him of Jesus’ crucifixion (24:21) and say that “today is the third day since these things happened” (24:22).
Wednesday to Sunday is four days.
A possible explanation is that they may have been counting since Wednesday evening at Christ’s burial, which begins the Jewish Thursday, and Thursday to Sunday could be counted as three days.
In the grand scheme of things, it is not all that important to know what day of the week Christ was crucified.
If it were very important, then God’s Word would have clearly communicated the day and timeframe.
What is important is that He did die and that He physically, bodily rose from the dead.
What is equally important is the reason He died—to take the punishment that all sinners deserve.
John 3:16 and 3:36 both proclaim that putting your trust in Him results in eternal life!
This is equally true whether He was crucified on a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.

 The Bible, God’s Word, tells us what God is like and what He is not like.
Without the authority of the Bible, any attempt to explain God’s attributes would be no better than an opinion, which by itself is often incorrect, especially in understanding God (Job 42:7).
To say that it is important for us to try to understand what God is like is a huge understatement.
Failure to do so can cause us to set up, chase after, and worship false gods contrary to His will (Exodus 20:3-5).
Only what God has chosen to reveal of Himself can be known.
One of God’s attributes or qualities is “light,” meaning that He is self-revealing in information of Himself (Isaiah 60:19; James 1:17).
The fact that God has revealed knowledge of Himself should not be neglected (Hebrews 4:1).
Creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh (Jesus Christ) will help us to know what God is like.
Let’s start by understanding that God is our Creator and that we are a part of His creation (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 24:1) and are created in His image.
Man is above the rest of creation and was given dominion over it (Genesis 1:26-28).
Creation is marred by the fall but still offers a glimpse of God’s works (Genesis 3:17-18; Romans 1:19-20).
By considering creation’s vastness, complexity, beauty, and order, we can have a sense of the awesomeness of God.
Reading through some of the names of God can be helpful in our search of what God is like.
They are as follows:
       Yahweh - LORD “I Am,” meaning the eternal self-existent God (Exodus 3:13, 14).
God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and His existence will never end.
He is immortal and infinite (Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2; 1 Timothy 1:17).
God is immutable, meaning He is unchanging; this in turn means that God is absolutely reliable and trustworthy (Malachi 3:6; Numbers 23:19; Psalm 102:26, 27).
God is incomparable; there is no one like Him in works or being.
He is unequaled and perfect (2 Samuel 7:22; Psalm 86:8; Isaiah 40:25; Matthew 5:48).
God is inscrutable, unfathomable, unsearchable, and past finding out as far as understanding Him completely (Isaiah 40:28; Psalm 145:3; Romans 11:33, 34).
God is just; He is no respecter of persons in the sense of showing favoritism (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 18:30).
God is omnipotent; He is all-powerful and can do anything that pleases Him, but His actions will always be in accord with the rest of His character (Revelation 19:6; Jeremiah 32:17, 27).
God is omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere, but this does not mean that God is everything (Psalm 139:7-13; Jeremiah 23:23).
God is omniscient, meaning He knows the past, present, and future, including what we are thinking at any given moment.
Since He knows everything, His justice will always be administered fairly (Psalm 139:1-5; Proverbs 5:21).
God is one; not only is there no other, but He is alone in being able to meet the deepest needs and longings of our hearts.
God alone is worthy of our worship and devotion (Deuteronomy 6:4).
God is righteous, meaning that God cannot and will not pass over wrongdoing.
It is because of God’s righteousness and justice that, in order for our sins to be forgiven, Jesus had to experience God’s wrath when our sins were placed upon Him (Exodus 9:27; Matthew 27:45-46; Romans 3:21-26).
God is sovereign, meaning He is supreme.
All of His creation put together cannot thwart His purposes (Psalm 93:1; 95:3; Jeremiah 23:20).
God is spirit, meaning He is invisible (John 1:18; 4:24).
God is a Trinity.
He is three in one, the same in substance, equal in power and glory.
God is truth, He will remain incorruptible and cannot lie (Psalm 117:2; 1 Samuel 15:29).
God is holy, separated from all moral defilement and hostile toward it.
God sees all evil and it angers Him.
God is referred to as a consuming fire (Isaiah 6:3; Habakkuk 1:13; Exodus 3:2, 4-5; Hebrews 12:29).
God is gracious, and His grace includes His goodness, kindness, mercy, and love.
If it were not for God’s grace, His holiness would exclude us from His presence.
Thankfully, this is not the case, for He desires to know each of us personally (Exodus 34:6; Psalm 31:19; 1 Peter 1:3; John 3:16, 17:3).
Since God is an infinite Being, no human can fully answer this God-sized question, but through God’s Word, we can understand much about who God is and what He is like.
May we all wholeheartedly continue to seek after Him (Jeremiah 29:13).

                                                                                         Answer
 The Four Spiritual Laws are a way of sharing the good news of the salvation that is available through faith in Jesus Christ.
It is a simple way of organizing the important information in the Gospel into four points.
The first of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life."
John 3:16 tells us, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."
John 10:10 gives us the reason that Jesus came, "I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."
What is blocking us from God’s love?
What is preventing us from having an abundant life?
The second of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Humanity is tainted by sin and is therefore separated from God.
As a result, we cannot know God’s wonderful plan for our lives."
Romans 3:23 affirms this information, "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
God created us to have fellowship with Him.
We have ruined the relationship with Him that God intended us to have.
What is the solution?
The third of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Jesus Christ is God’s only provision for our sin.
Through Jesus Christ, we can have our sins forgiven and restore a right relationship with God."
Romans 5:8 tells us, "But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 informs us of what we need to know and believe in order to be saved, "...that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures..." Jesus Himself declares that He is the only way of salvation in John 14:6, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 informs us of what we need to know and believe in order to be saved, "...that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures..." Jesus Himself declares that He is the only way of salvation in John 14:6, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
How can I receive this wonderful gift of salvation?
The Fourth of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "We must place our faith in Jesus Christ as Savior in order to receive the gift of salvation and know God’s wonderful plan for our lives."
John 1:12 describes this for us, "Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God."
Acts 16:31 says it very clearly, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved!"
We can be saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone (Ephesians 2:8-9).
If you want to trust in Jesus Christ as your Savior, say the following words to God.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
Saying these words will not save you, but trusting in Christ will!
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and deserve punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
 What does it mean to accept Jesus as your personal Savior?
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.

 It is often claimed that “God instituted the Sabbath in Eden” because of the connection between the Sabbath and creation in Exodus 20:11.
Although God’s rest on the seventh day (Genesis 2:3) did foreshadow a future Sabbath law, there is no biblical record of the Sabbath before the children of Israel left the land of Egypt.

It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested” (Exodus 31:16–17).
In Deuteronomy 5, Moses restates the Ten Commandments to the next generation of Israelites.
Here, after commanding Sabbath observance in verses 12–14, Moses gives the reason the Sabbath was given to the nation Israel: “Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.

God’s intent for giving the Sabbath to Israel was not that they would remember creation, but that they would remember their Egyptian slavery and the Lord’s deliverance.
A person breaking the Sabbath law was to be put to death (Exodus 31:15; Numbers 15:32–35).
An examination of New Testament passages shows us four important points: 1) Whenever Christ appears in His resurrected form and the day is mentioned, it is always the first day of the week (Matthew 28:1, 9, 10; Mark 16:9; Luke 24:1, 13, 15; John 20:19, 26).

Emirund gyokka sabbiti gyeyogerwako okuva Mu Bikolwa okutuuka mu Okubikkulirwa, guba omukolo gw’abayudaaya kubuuliramu enjiri era munkola eya weema oba sinagiiga ( Ebikolwa 13-18).
Paul wrote, “To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews” (1 Corinthians 9:20).
Paul did not go to the synagogue to fellowship with and edify the saints, but to convict and save the lost.
Bwamala awo, Pawulo agamba, “kaakano nnaagenda eri ab'amawanga”( Ebikolwa 18:6), Sabbiti teddamu kwogerwako wantu wonna walala.
Era Mukifo ky’okukunga abantu okukuuma sabbiti, ekittundu ekisigadde eky’Endagaano empya ate kigya abantu ku sabbiti (Okujjako Abakkoluosaayi 2:16)
Looking more closely at point 4 above will reveal that there is no obligation for the New Testament believer to keep the Sabbath, and will also show that the idea of a Sunday “Christian Sabbath” is also unscriptural.
As discussed above, there is one time the Sabbath is mentioned after Paul began to focus on the Gentiles, “Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.

These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ” (Colossians 2:16–17).
The Jewish Sabbath was abolished at the cross where Christ “canceled the written code, with its regulations” (Colossians 2:14).
This idea is repeated more than once in the New Testament: “One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike.
Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.
He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord” (Romans 14:5–6a).
“But now that you know God — or rather are known by God — how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles?
You are observing special days and months and seasons and years” (Galatians 4:9–10).
For instance, Acts 20:7 states that “on the first day of the week we came together to break bread.” In 1 Corinthians 16:2 Paul urges the Corinthian believers “on the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income.” Since Paul designates this offering as “service” in 2 Corinthians 9:12, this collection must have been linked with the Sunday worship service of the Christian assembly.
But some claim that a mandate by Constantine in A.D. 321 “changed” the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday.
On what day did the early church meet for worship?
Scripture never mentions any Sabbath (Saturday) gatherings by believers for fellowship or worship.
For instance, Acts 20:7 states that “on the first day of the week we came together to break bread.” In 1 Corinthians 16:2 Paul urges the Corinthian believers “on the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income.” Since Paul designates this offering as “service” in 2 Corinthians 9:12, this collection must have been linked with the Sunday worship service of the Christian assembly.

The first day of the week, Sunday, the Lord’s Day (Revelation 1:10) celebrates the New Creation, with Christ as our resurrected Head.

The Sabbath is still Saturday, not Sunday, and has never been changed.

We are not obligated to follow the Mosaic Sabbath—resting, but are now free to follow the risen Christ—serving.
We are to worship God every day, not just on Saturday or Sunday.

 Let’s look at how the Bible describes love, and then we will see a few ways in which God is the essence of love.
It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
Love never fails” (1 Corinthians 13:4-8a).
This is God’s description of love, and because God is love (1 John 4:8), this is what He is like.
In love, God does not force Himself on anyone.
Those who come to Him do so in response to His love.
In love, God shows kindness to all.
In love, Jesus went about doing good to everyone without partiality.
In love, Jesus did not covet what others had, living a humble life without complaining.
In love, God does not force Himself on anyone.
In love, God does not force Himself on anyone.
In love, Jesus willingly obeyed His Father in heaven.
“The world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me” (John 14:31).
Those who come to Him do so in response to His love.
In love, Jesus was/is always looking out for the interests of others.
The greatest expression of God’s love is communicated to us in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Romans 5:8 proclaims the same message: “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” We can see from these verses that it is God’s greatest desire that we join Him in His eternal home, heaven.

He has made the way possible by paying the price for our sins.
He loves us because He chose to as an act of His will.
Love forgives.
“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).
So, what does it mean that God is love?
So, what does it mean that God is love?
Love is a core aspect of God’s character, His Person.
God’s love is in no sense in conflict with His holiness, righteousness, justice, or even His wrath.
All of God’s attributes are in perfect harmony.
Love is an attribute of God.
God is the perfect example of true love.
Amazingly, God has given those who receive His Son Jesus as their personal Savior the ability to love as He does, through the power of the Holy Spirit (John 1:12; 1 John 3:1, 23-24).

 Jesus is not God’s Son in the sense of a human father and a son.
God did not get married and have a son.
God did not mate with Mary and, together with her, produce a son.
Jesus is God’s Son in that He was conceived in Mary by the Holy Spirit.
Jesus is God’s Son in the sense that He is God made manifest in human form (John 1:1, 14).
Jesus is God’s Son in that He was conceived in Mary by the Holy Spirit.
Luke 1:35 declares, “The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
 During His trial before the Jewish leaders, the High Priest demanded of Jesus, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God” (Matthew 26:63).
‘But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven’” (Matthew 26:64).
 During His trial before the Jewish leaders, the High Priest demanded of Jesus, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God” (Matthew 26:63).
“‘Yes, it is as you say,’ Jesus replied.
Later, before Pontius Pilate, “The Jews insisted, ‘We have a law, and according to that law He must die, because He claimed to be the Son of God’” (John 19:7).
Why would His claiming to be the Son of God be considered blasphemy and be worthy of a death sentence?
The Jewish leaders understood exactly what Jesus meant by the phrase “Son of God.” To be the Son of God is to be of the same nature as God.
The Son of God is “of God.” The claim to be of the same nature as God—to in fact be God—was blasphemy to the Jewish leaders; therefore, they demanded Jesus’ death, in keeping with Leviticus 24:15.
Hebrews 1:3 expresses this very clearly, “The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His being.”
 Another example can be found in John 17:12 where Judas is described as the “son of perdition.” John 6:71 tells us that Judas was the son of Simon.
What does John 17:12 mean by describing Judas as the “son of perdition”?
The word perdition means “destruction, ruin, waste.” Judas was not the literal son of “ruin, destruction, and waste,” but those things were the identity of Judas' life.
Judas was a manifestation of perdition.
In this same way, Jesus is the Son of God.
The Son of God is God.
Jesus is God made manifest (John 1:1, 14).

 The classic passage from the Bible that answers this question is John 3:1-21.
The Lord Jesus Christ is talking to Nicodemus, a prominent Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin (the ruling body of the Jews).
As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, “‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’ ‘How can a man be born when he is old?’ Nicodemus asked.
As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, “‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’ ‘How can a man be born when he is old?’ Nicodemus asked.
‘Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be born!’ Jesus answered, ‘I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
‘Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be born!’ Jesus answered, ‘I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.
You should not be surprised at my saying, “You must be born again”’” (John 3:3-7).
The phrase "born again" literally means "born from above."
He needed a change of his heart—a spiritual transformation.
Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.
New birth, being born again, is an act of God whereby eternal life is imparted to the person who believes (2 Corinthians 5:17; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:3; 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1-4, 18).
John 1:12, 13 indicates that being "born again" also carries the idea of "becoming children of God" through trust in the name of Jesus Christ.
The question logically comes, "Why does a person need to be born again?"
The apostle Paul in Ephesians 2:1 says, "And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins" (NKJV).
To the Romans he wrote, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
Sinners are spiritually “dead”; when they receive spiritual life through faith in Christ, the Bible likens it to a rebirth.
Sinners are spiritually “dead”; when they receive spiritual life through faith in Christ, the Bible likens it to a rebirth.
Only those who are born again have their sins forgiven and have a relationship with God.
How does that come to be?
Ephesians 2:8-9 states, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."
When one is saved, he/she has been born again, spiritually renewed, and is now a child of God by right of new birth.
Trusting in Jesus Christ, the One who paid the penalty of sin when He died on the cross, is the means to be "born again."
Ephesians 2:8-9 states, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."
(2 Corinthians 5:17).
If you have never trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior, will you consider the prompting of the Holy Spirit as He speaks to your heart?
You need to be born again.
Will you pray the prayer of repentance and become a new creation in Christ today?
"Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God" (John 1:12-13).
"Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God" (John 1:12-13).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and be born again, here is a sample prayer.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness—the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"

 Many Christians struggle with the issue of tithing.
In some churches giving is over-emphasized.
At the same time, many Christians refuse to submit to the biblical exhortations about making offerings to the Lord.
Tithing/giving is intended to be a joy and a blessing.
Sadly, that is sometimes not the case in the church today.
                                                                                         Answer
The tithe was a requirement of the Law in which the Israelites were to give 10 percent of the crops they grew and the livestock they raised to the tabernacle/temple (Leviticus 27:30; Numbers 18:26; Deuteronomy 14:24; 2 Chronicles 31:5).
In fact, the Old Testament Law required multiple tithes—one for the Levites, one for the use of the temple and the feasts, and one for the poor of the land—which would have pushed the total to around 23.3 percent.
Some understand the Old Testament tithe as a method of taxation to provide for the needs of the priests and Levites in the sacrificial system.
After the death of Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law, the New Testament nowhere commands, or even recommends, that Christians submit to a legalistic tithe system.
The New Testament nowhere designates a percentage of income a person should set aside, but only says gifts should be “in keeping with income” (1 Corinthians 16:2).
Some in the Christian church have taken the 10 percent figure from the Old Testament tithe and applied it as a “recommended minimum” for Christians in their giving.
The New Testament talks about the importance and benefits of giving.
We are to give as we are able.
Sometimes that means giving more than 10 percent; sometimes that may mean giving less.
It all depends on the ability of the Christian and the needs of the body of Christ.
Every Christian should diligently pray and seek God’s wisdom in the matter of participating in tithing and/or how much to give (James 1:5).
Above all, all tithes and offerings should be given with pure motives and an attitude of worship to God and service to the body of Christ.
“Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7).

 Demons are fallen angels, as Revelation 12:9 indicates: “The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray.
When he fell, Satan took some of the angels with him—one third of them, according to Revelation 12:4.
Jude 6  also mentions angels who sinned.
So, biblically, demons are fallen angels who, along with Satan, chose to rebel against God.
Some of the demons are already locked “in darkness, bound with everlasting chains” (Jude 1:6) for their sin.
Others are free to roam and are referred to as “the powers of this dark world and .

So, biblically, demons are fallen angels who, along with Satan, chose to rebel against God.
the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms” in Ephesians 6:12 (cf.
Demons, as spirit beings, have the ability to take possession of a physical body.
Demonic possession occurs when a person’s body is completely controlled by a demon.
This cannot happen to a child of God, since the Holy Spirit resides in the heart of the believer in Christ (1 John 4:4).
Jesus, during His earthly ministry, encountered many demons.
Of course, none of them were a match for the power of Christ: “Many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word” (Matthew 8:16).
The demons still follow Satan as their leader and do battle with the holy angels in an attempt to thwart God’s plan and hinder God’s people (Daniel 10:13).
Jesus’ authority over the demons was one of the proofs that He was indeed the Son of God (Luke 11:20).
The demons are described as evil spirits (Matthew 10:1), unclean spirits (Mark 1:27), lying spirits (1 Kings 22:23), and angels of Satan (Revelation 12:9).
The demons who encountered Jesus knew who He was, and they feared Him: “‘What do you want with us, Son of God?’ [the demons] shouted.
‘Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?’” (Matthew 8:29).
The demons know their end will be one of torment.
Satan and his demons now look to destroy the work of God and deceive anyone they can (1 Peter 5:8; 2 Corinthians 11:14–15).
The demons are described as evil spirits (Matthew 10:1), unclean spirits (Mark 1:27), lying spirits (1 Kings 22:23), and angels of Satan (Revelation 12:9).
Satan and his demons deceive the world (2 Corinthians 4:4), promulgate false doctrine (1 Timothy 4:1), attack Christians (2 Corinthians 12:7; 1 Peter 5:8), and combat the holy angels (Revelation 12:4–9).
Satan and his demons deceive the world (2 Corinthians 4:4), promulgate false doctrine (1 Timothy 4:1), attack Christians (2 Corinthians 12:7; 1 Peter 5:8), and combat the holy angels (Revelation 12:4–9).
The demons/fallen angels are enemies of God, but they are defeated enemies.
Christ has “disarmed the powers and authorities,” and He has “made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross” (Colossians 2:15).
The demons are described as evil spirits (Matthew 10:1), unclean spirits (Mark 1:27), lying spirits (1 Kings 22:23), and angels of Satan (Revelation 12:9).
As we submit to God and resist the devil, we have nothing to fear.

 First of all, no matter what view one takes on the issue of divorce, it is important to remember Malachi 2:16: “I hate divorce, says the LORD God of Israel.” According to the Bible, marriage is a lifetime commitment.
 First of all, no matter what view one takes on the issue of divorce, it is important to remember Malachi 2:16: “I hate divorce, says the LORD God of Israel.” According to the Bible, marriage is a lifetime commitment.
“So they are no longer two, but one.
Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate” (Matthew 19:6).
God realizes, though, that, since marriages involve two sinful human beings, divorces are going to occur.
In the Old Testament, He laid down some laws in order to protect the rights of divorcées, especially women (Deuteronomy 24:1–4).
Jesus pointed out that these laws were given because of the hardness of people’s hearts, not because such laws were God’s desire (Matthew 19:8).
The controversy over whether divorce and remarriage is allowed according to the Bible revolves primarily around Jesus’ words in Matthew 5:32 and 19:9.
Many interpreters understand this “exception clause” as referring to “marital unfaithfulness” during the “betrothal” period.
In Jewish custom, a man and a woman were considered married even while they were still engaged or “betrothed.” According to this view, immorality during this “betrothal” period would then be the only valid reason for a divorce.
In Jewish custom, a man and a woman were considered married even while they were still engaged or “betrothed.” According to this view, immorality during this “betrothal” period would then be the only valid reason for a divorce.
However, the Greek word translated “marital unfaithfulness” is a word which can mean any form of sexual immorality.
It can mean fornication, prostitution, adultery, etc.
Jesus is possibly saying that divorce is permissible if sexual immorality is committed.
Jesus is possibly saying that divorce is permissible if sexual immorality is committed.
Sexual relations are an integral part of the marital bond: “the two will become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5; Ephesians 5:31).
Therefore, any breaking of that bond by sexual relations outside of marriage might be a permissible reason for divorce.
If so, Jesus also has remarriage in mind in this passage.
The phrase “and marries another” (Matthew 19:9) indicates that divorce and remarriage are allowed in an instance of the exception clause, whatever it is interpreted to be.
It is important to note that only the innocent party is allowed to remarry.
Although not stated in the text, it would seem the allowance for remarriage after divorce is God’s mercy for the one who was sinned against, not for the one who committed the sexual immorality.
There may be instances where the “guilty party” is allowed to remarry, but they are not evident in this text.
Some understand 1 Corinthians 7:15 as another “exception,” allowing remarriage if an unbelieving spouse divorces a believer.
However, the context does not mention remarriage but only says a believer is not bound to continue a marriage if an unbelieving spouse wants to leave.
Others claim that abuse (spousal or child) is a valid reason for divorce even though it is not listed as such in the Bible.
While this may very well be the case, it is never wise to presume upon the Word of God.
Sometimes lost in the debate over the exception clause is the fact that, whatever “marital unfaithfulness” means, it is an allowance for divorce, not a requirement for it.
Even when adultery is committed, a couple can, through God’s grace, learn to forgive and begin rebuilding their marriage.
God has forgiven us of so much more.
Surely we can follow His example and even forgive the sin of adultery (Ephesians 4:32).
However, in many instances a spouse is unrepentant and continues in sexual immorality.
That is where Matthew 19:9 can possibly be applied.
Many also look to quickly remarry after a divorce when God might desire them to remain single.
God sometimes calls people to be single so that their attention is not divided (1 Corinthians 7:32–35).
The Bible makes it abundantly clear that God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16) and that reconciliation and forgiveness should mark a believer’s life (Luke 11:4; Ephesians 4:32).
A divorced and/or remarried believer should not feel any less loved by God, even if the divorce and/or remarriage is not covered under the possible exception clause of Matthew 19:9.
A divorced and/or remarried believer should not feel any less loved by God, even if the divorce and/or remarriage is not covered under the possible exception clause of Matthew 19:9.

 Scripture has much to say regarding the drinking of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3; Deuteronomy 29:6; Judges 13:4, 7, 14; Proverbs 20:1; 31:4; Isaiah 5:11, 22; 24:9; 28:7; 29:9; 56:12).
However, Scripture does not necessarily forbid a Christian from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol.
In fact, some Scriptures discuss alcohol in positive terms.
Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.” Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from your own vineyard as a sign of God’s blessing.

  What God commands Christians regarding alcohol is to avoid drunkenness (Ephesians 5:18).
The Bible condemns drunkenness and its effects (Proverbs 23:29-35).
Christians are also commanded to not allow their bodies to be “mastered” by anything (1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19).
Christians are also commanded to not allow their bodies to be “mastered” by anything (1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19).
Drinking alcohol in excess is undeniably addictive.
Scripture also forbids a Christian from doing anything that might offend other Christians or encourage them to sin against their conscience (1 Corinthians 8:9-13).
The Bible condemns drunkenness and its effects (Proverbs 23:29-35).
In light of these principles, it would be extremely difficult for any Christian to say he is drinking alcohol in excess to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31).
In light of these principles, it would be extremely difficult for any Christian to say he is drinking alcohol in excess to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31).
Jesus changed water into wine.
Jesus changed water into wine.
In New Testament times, the water was not very clean.
Without modern sanitation, the water was often filled with bacteria, viruses, and all kinds of contaminants.
The same is true in many third-world countries today.
As a result, people often drank wine (or grape juice) because it was far less likely to be contaminated.
In 1 Timothy 5:23, Paul instructed Timothy to stop drinking water exclusively (which was probably causing his stomach problems) and instead drink wine.
In that day, wine was fermented (containing alcohol), but not necessarily to the degree it is today.
Again, Scripture does not forbid Christians from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol.
Alcohol is not, in and of itself, tainted by sin.
It is drunkenness and addiction to alcohol that a Christian must absolutely refrain from (Ephesians 5:18; 1 Corinthians 6:12).
Alcohol, consumed in small quantities, is neither harmful nor addictive.
In fact, some doctors advocate drinking small amounts of red wine for its health benefits, especially for the heart.
Consumption of small quantities of alcohol is a matter of Christian freedom.
Drunkenness and addiction are sin.
However, due to the biblical concerns regarding alcohol and its effects, due to the easy temptation to consume alcohol in excess, and due to the possibility of causing offense and/or stumbling of others, it is often best for a Christian to abstain from drinking alcohol.

 In some people’s minds, being homosexual is as much outside one’s control as the color of your skin and your height.
On the other hand, the Bible clearly and consistently declares that homosexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19:1–13; Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:10).
This disconnect leads to much controversy, debate, and even hostility.
When examining what the Bible says about homosexuality, it is important to distinguish between homosexual behavior and homosexual inclinations or attractions.
It is the difference between active sin and the passive condition of being tempted.
                                                                                         Answer
Homosexual behavior is sinful, but the Bible never says it is a sin to be tempted.
Simply stated, a struggle with temptation may lead to sin, but the struggle itself is not a sin.
Romans 1:26–27 teaches that homosexuality is a result of denying and disobeying God.
When people continue in sin and unbelief, God “gives them over” to even more wicked and depraved sin to show them the futility and hopelessness of life apart from God.
When people continue in sin and unbelief, God “gives them over” to even more wicked and depraved sin to show them the futility and hopelessness of life apart from God.
First Corinthians 6:9 proclaims that those who practice homosexuality, and therefore transgress God’s created order, are not saved.
A person may be born with a greater susceptibility to homosexuality, just as some people are born with a tendency to violence and other sins.
That does not excuse the person’s choosing to sin by giving in to sinful desires.
Just because a person is born with a greater susceptibility to fits of rage, that doesn’t make it right for him to give in to those desires and explode at every provocation.
When people continue in sin and unbelief, God “gives them over” to even more wicked and depraved sin to show them the futility and hopelessness of life apart from God.
Paul lists many of the sins that the Corinthians once practiced (homosexuality is on the list).
Our thoughts, desires, and dispositions are all affected.
But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (emphasis added).
In other words, some of the Corinthians, before they were saved, lived homosexual lifestyles; but no sin is too great for the cleansing power of Jesus.
That does not excuse the person’s choosing to sin by giving in to sinful desires.
The problem with homosexual attraction is that it is an attraction to something God has forbidden, and any desire for something sinful ultimately has its roots in sin.
The pervasive nature of sin causes us to see the world and our own actions through a warped perspective.
Our thoughts, desires, and dispositions are all affected.
So, homosexual attraction does not always result in active, willful sin—there may not be a conscious choice to sin—but it springs from the sinful nature.
Same-sex attraction is always, on some basic level, an expression of the fallen nature.
As sinful human beings living in a sinful world (Romans 3:23), we are beset with weaknesses, temptations, and inducements to sin.
Our world is filled with lures and entrapments, including the enticement to practice homosexuality.
The temptation to engage in homosexual behavior is very real to many.
Those who struggle with homosexual attraction often report suffering through years of wishing things were different.
People may not always be able to control how or what they feel, but they can control what they do with those feelings (1 Peter 1:5–8).
We all have the responsibility to resist temptation (Ephesians 6:13).
We must all be transformed by the renewing of our minds (Romans 12:2).
God promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).
Finally, the Bible does not describe homosexuality as a “greater” sin than any other.
All sin is offensive to God.
Without Christ, we are lost, whatever type of sin has entangled us.
According to the Bible, God’s forgiveness is available to the homosexual just as it is to the adulterer, idol worshiper, murderer, and thief.
All sin is offensive to God.
God promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).

 The Old Testament Law commanded the Israelites not to engage in interracial marriage (Deuteronomy 7:3–4).
 The Old Testament Law commanded the Israelites not to engage in interracial marriage (Deuteronomy 7:3–4).
                                                                                         Answer
The reason God commanded against interracial marriage for the Jews was that people of other races were worshipers of false gods.
The Israelites would be led astray from God if they intermarried with idol worshipers, pagans, or heathens.
This is exactly what happened in Israel, according to Malachi 2:11.
A similar principle of spiritual purity is laid out in the New Testament, but it has nothing to do with race: “Do not be yoked together with unbelievers.
Just as the Israelites (believers in the one true God) were commanded not to marry idolaters, so Christians (believers in the one true God) are commanded not to marry unbelievers.
For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?
Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14).
Just as the Israelites (believers in the one true God) were commanded not to marry idolaters, so Christians (believers in the one true God) are commanded not to marry unbelievers.
The Bible never says that interracial marriage is wrong.
As Martin Luther King, Jr., noted, a person should be judged by his or her character, not by skin color.
There is no place in the life of the Christian for favoritism based on race (James 2:1–10).
In fact, the biblical perspective is that there is only one “race”—the human race, with everyone having descended from Adam and Eve.
When selecting a mate, a Christian should first find out if the potential spouse is born again by faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:3–5).
Faith in Christ, not skin color, is the biblical standard for choosing a spouse.
Interracial marriage is not a matter of right or wrong but of wisdom, discernment, and prayer.
A couple considering marriage needs to weigh many factors.
While a difference in skin color should not be ignored, it absolutely should not be the determining factor in whether a couple should marry.
An interracial couple may face discrimination and ridicule, and they should be prepared to respond to such prejudice in a biblical manner.
“There is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him” (Romans 10:12).
A colorblind church and/or a Christian interracial marriage can be a powerful illustration of our equality in Christ.

 There is no Hebrew or Greek word used in the Bible that precisely refers to sex before marriage.
The Bible undeniably condemns adultery and sexual immorality, but is sex before marriage considered sexually immoral?
According to 1 Corinthians 7:2, “yes” is the clear answer: “But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.” In this verse, Paul states that marriage is the “cure” for sexual immorality.
According to 1 Corinthians 7:2, “yes” is the clear answer: “But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.” In this verse, Paul states that marriage is the “cure” for sexual immorality.
Sex before marriage is included in the biblical definition of sexual immorality.
First Corinthians 7:2 is essentially saying that, because people cannot control themselves and so many are having immoral sex outside of marriage, people should get married.
Then they can fulfill their passions in a moral way.
Since 1 Corinthians 7:2 clearly includes sex before marriage in the definition of sexual immorality, all of the Bible verses that condemn sexual immorality as being sinful also condemn sex before marriage as sinful.
There are numerous Scriptures that declare sex before marriage to be a sin (Acts 15:20; 1 Corinthians 5:1; 6:13, 18; 10:8; 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Jude 7).
The Bible promotes complete abstinence before marriage.
Sex within marriage is pleasurable, and God designed it that way.
There are numerous Scriptures that declare sex before marriage to be a sin (Acts 15:20; 1 Corinthians 5:1; 6:13, 18; 10:8; 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Jude 7).
Far too often we focus on the “recreation” aspect of sex without recognizing that there is another aspect—procreation.
Sex within marriage is pleasurable, and God designed it that way.
God wants men and women to enjoy sexual activity within the confines of marriage.
Song of Solomon and several other Bible passages (such as Proverbs 5:19) clearly describe the pleasure of sex.
However, the couple must understand that God’s intent for sex includes producing children.
Every Young Man’s Battle : Strategies for Victory in the Real World of Sexual Temptation by Stephen Arterburn.Women - Every Young Woman’s Battle: Guarding Your Mind, Heart, and Body in a Sex-Saturated World by Shannon Ethridge
While practicality does not determine right from wrong, if the Bible’s message on sex before marriage were obeyed, there would be far fewer sexually transmitted diseases, far fewer abortions, far fewer unwed mothers and unwanted pregnancies, and far fewer children growing up without both parents in their lives.
Abstinence is God’s only policy when it comes to sex before marriage.
Abstinence saves lives, protects babies, gives sexual relations the proper value, and, most importantly, honors God.

Some people in Scripture felt deep despair in life.
 The Bible mentions six specific people who committed suicide: Abimelech (Judges 9:54), Saul (1 Samuel 31:4), Saul’s armor-bearer (1 Samuel 31:4–6), Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17:23), Zimri (1 Kings 16:18), and Judas (Matthew 27:5).
Five of these men were noted for their wickedness (the exception is Saul’s armor-bearer—nothing is said of his character).
Some consider Samson’s death an instance of suicide, because he knew his actions would lead to his death (Judges 16:26–31), but Samson’s goal was to kill Philistines, not himself.
The Bible views suicide as equal to murder, which is what it is—self-murder.
God is the only one who is to decide when and how a person should die.
So, according to the Bible, suicide is a sin.
Suicide, the taking of one’s own life, is ungodly because it rejects God’s gift of life.
Suicide, the taking of one’s own life, is ungodly because it rejects God’s gift of life.
So, according to the Bible, suicide is a sin.
Solomon, in his pursuit of pleasure, reached the point where he “hated life” (Ecclesiastes 2:17).
Paul learned that, although the pressure he faced was beyond his ability to endure, the Lord can bear all things: “This happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead” (2 Corinthians 1:9).
It is not the “greatest” sin—it is no worse than other evils, in terms of how God sees it, and it does not determine a person’s eternal destiny.
Paul learned that, although the pressure he faced was beyond his ability to endure, the Lord can bear all things: “This happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead” (2 Corinthians 1:9).

 Tattoos are more popular than ever in many parts of the world.
The number of people with tattoos has increased dramatically in recent years.
Tattoos are not just for delinquents or rebels anymore.
The edginess of rebellion historically associated with tattoos is starting to wear off.
The New Testament does not say anything about whether or not a believer in Jesus Christ should get a tattoo.
Therefore, we cannot say that getting a tattoo is a sin.
Because of Scripture’s silence, getting inked falls under the category of a “gray area,” and believers should follow their convictions in the matter, respecting those who may have different convictions.
Here are some general biblical principles that may apply to getting a tattoo:
 ◦ Children are to honor and obey their parents (Ephesians 6:1–2).
For a minor to get a tattoo in violation of his or her parents’ wishes is biblically unsupportable.
Tattoos born of rebellion are sinful.
◦ “Outward adornment” is not as important as the development of the “inner self” and should not be the focus of a Christian (1 Peter 3:3–4).
A person who desires a tattoo to garner attention or draw admiration has a vain, sinful focus on self.
◦ God sees the heart, and our motivation for anything we do should be to glorify God (1 Corinthians 10:31).
Motivations for getting a tattoo such as “to fit in,” “to stand out,” etc., fall short of the glory of God.
The tattoo itself may not be a sin, but the motivation in getting it might be.
◦ Our bodies, as well as our souls, have been redeemed and belong to God.
The believer’s body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).
How much modification of that temple is appropriate?
Is there a line that should not be crossed?
Is there a point at which the proliferation of tattoos on one body ceases to be art and starts becoming sinful mutilation?
This should be a matter of individual reflection and honest prayer.
◦ We are Christ’s ambassadors, delivering God’s message to the world (2 Corinthians 5:20).
What message does the tattoo send, and will it aid or detract from representing Christ and sharing the gospel?
◦ Whatever does not come from faith is sin (Romans 14:23), so the person getting the tattoo should be fully convinced that it is God’s will for him or her.
The bottom line is that getting a tattoo is not a sin, per se.
It is a matter of Christian freedom and should be guided by biblical principles and rooted in love.

 Questions about Sin
                                                                                         Answer
 There is perhaps no more hotly debated issue in the church today than the issue of women serving as pastors.
As a result, it is very important to not see this issue as men versus women.
There are women who believe women should not serve as pastors and that the Bible places restrictions on the ministry of women, and there are men who believe women can serve as pastors and that there are no restrictions on women in ministry.
This is not an issue of chauvinism or discrimination.
It is an issue of biblical interpretation.
The Word of God proclaims, “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent” (1 Timothy 2:11–12).
This is a result of the way mankind was created and the way in which sin entered the world (1 Timothy 2:13–14).
This precludes women from serving as pastors over men, which definitely includes preaching to them, teaching them publicly, and exercising spiritual authority over them.
There are many objections to this view of women in pastoral ministry.
A common one is that Paul restricts women from teaching because in the first century, women were typically uneducated.
However, 1 Timothy 2:11–14 nowhere mentions educational status.
If education were a qualification for ministry, then the majority of Jesus’ disciples would not have been qualified.
A second common objection is that Paul only restricted the women of Ephesus from teaching men (1 Timothy was written to Timothy, the pastor of the church in Ephesus).
Ephesus was known for its temple to Artemis, and women were the authorities in that branch of paganism—therefore, the theory goes, Paul was only reacting against the female-led customs of the Ephesian idolaters, and the church needed to be different.
However, the book of 1 Timothy nowhere mentions Artemis, nor does Paul mention the standard practice of Artemis worshipers as a reason for the restrictions in 1 Timothy 2:11–12.
However, 1 Timothy 2:11–14 nowhere mentions educational status.
A third objection is that Paul is only referring to husbands and wives, not men and women in general.
The Greek words for “woman” and “man” in 1 Timothy 2 could refer to husbands and wives; however, the basic meaning of the words is broader than that.
Further, the same Greek words are used in verses 8–10.
Are only husbands to lift up holy hands in prayer without anger and disputing (verse 8)?
Are only wives to dress modestly, have good deeds, and worship God (verses 9–10)?
Of course not.
Verses 8–10 clearly refer to all men and women, not just husbands and wives.
There is nothing in the context that would indicate a narrowing to husbands and wives in verses 11–14.
Yet another objection to this interpretation of women in pastoral ministry is in relation to women who held positions of leadership in the Bible, specifically Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah in the Old Testament.
It is true that these women were chosen by God for special service to Him and that they stand as models of faith, courage, and, yes, leadership.
However, the authority of women in the Old Testament is not relevant to the issue of pastors in the church.
The New Testament Epistles present a new paradigm for God’s people—the church, the body of Christ—and that paradigm involves an authority structure unique to the church, not for the nation of Israel or any other Old Testament entity.
Similar arguments are made using Priscilla and Phoebe in the New Testament.
Priscilla’s name is mentioned first, perhaps indicating that she was more prominent in ministry than her husband.
Did Priscilla and her husband teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to Apollos?
Yes, in their home they “explained to him the way of God more adequately” (Acts 18:26).
Does the Bible ever say that Priscilla pastored a church or taught publicly or became the spiritual leader of a congregation of saints?
No.
As far as we know, Priscilla was not involved in ministry activity in contradiction to 1 Timothy 2:11–14.
In Romans 16:1, Phoebe is called a “deacon” (or “servant”) in the church and is highly commended by Paul.
But, as with Priscilla, there is nothing in Scripture to indicate that Phoebe was a pastor or a teacher of men in the church.
“Able to teach” is given as a qualification for elders, but not for deacons (1 Timothy 3:1–13; Titus 1:6–9).
The structure of 1 Timothy 2:11–14 makes the reason why women cannot be pastors perfectly clear.
Verse 13 begins with “for,” giving the “cause” of Paul’s statement in verses 11–12.
Why should women not teach or have authority over men?
And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived” (verses 13–14).
The order of creation has universal application in the family (Ephesians 5:22–33) and in the church.
The fact that Eve was deceived is also given in 1 Timothy 2:14 as a reason for women not serving as pastors or having spiritual authority over men.
This does not mean that women are gullible or that they are all more easily deceived than men.
If all women are more easily deceived, why would they be allowed to teach children (who are easily deceived) and other women (who are supposedly more easily deceived)?
Why should women not teach or have authority over men?
Because “Adam was created first, then Eve.
God has chosen to give men the primary teaching authority in the church.
Many women excel in gifts of hospitality, mercy, teaching, evangelism, and helping/serving.
Much of the ministry of the local church depends on women.
Women in the church are not restricted from public praying or prophesying (1 Corinthians 11:5), only from having spiritual teaching authority over men.
The Bible nowhere restricts women from exercising the gifts of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12).
Men are to set the example in spiritual leadership—in their lives and through their words.
Women, just as much as men, are called to minister to others, to demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23), and to proclaim the gospel to the lost (Matthew 28:18–20; Acts 1:8; 1 Peter 3:15).
God has ordained that only men are to serve in positions of spiritual teaching authority in the church.
This is not because men are necessarily better teachers or because women are inferior or less intelligent (which is not the case).
It is simply the way God designed the church to function.
Men are to set the example in spiritual leadership—in their lives and through their words.
Women are to take a less authoritative role.
Women are encouraged to teach other women (Titus 2:3–5).
The Bible also does not restrict women from teaching children.
The only activity women are restricted from is teaching or having spiritual authority over men.
This does not make women less important, by any means, but rather gives them a ministry focus more in agreement with God’s plan and His gifting of them.

 The most difficult thing about the Christian concept of the Trinity is that there is no way to perfectly and completely understand it.
 The most difficult thing about the Christian concept of the Trinity is that there is no way to perfectly and completely understand it.
God is infinitely greater than we are; therefore, we should not expect to be able to fully understand Him.
God is infinitely greater than we are; therefore, we should not expect to be able to fully understand Him.
The Bible teaches that the Father is God, that Jesus is God, and that the Holy Spirit is God.
The Bible also teaches that there is only one God.
Though we can understand some facts about the relationship of the different Persons of the Trinity to one another, ultimately, it is incomprehensible to the human mind.
However, this does not mean the Trinity is not true or that it is not based on the teachings of the Bible.
The following is what God’s Word says about the Trinity:
Understand that this is not in any way suggesting three Gods.
Keep in mind when studying this subject that the word “Trinity” is not found in Scripture.
This is a term that is used to attempt to describe the triune God—three coexistent, co-eternal Persons who are God.
Keep in mind when studying this subject that the word “Trinity” is not found in Scripture.
The following is what God’s Word says about the Trinity:
Understand that this is not in any way suggesting three Gods.
 1) There is one God (Deuteronomy 6:4; 1 Corinthians 8:4; Galatians 3:20; 1 Timothy 2:5).
The following is what God’s Word says about the Trinity:
2) The Trinity consists of three Persons (Genesis 1:1, 26; 3:22; 11:7; Isaiah 6:8, 48:16, 61:1; Matthew 3:16-17, 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14).
While this is not an explicit argument for the Trinity, it does denote the aspect of plurality in God.
The Hebrew word for "God," "Elohim," definitely allows for the Trinity.
In Isaiah 48:16 and 61:1, the Son is speaking while making reference to the Father and the Holy Spirit.
Compare Isaiah 61:1 to Luke 4:14-19 to see that it is the Son speaking.
Matthew 3:16-17 describes the event of Jesus’ baptism.
Seen in this passage is God the Holy Spirit descending on God the Son while God the Father proclaims His pleasure in the Son.
Matthew 28:19 and 2 Corinthians 13:14 are examples of three distinct Persons in the Trinity.
3) The members of the Trinity are distinguished one from another in various passages.
3) The members of the Trinity are distinguished one from another in various passages.
In the Old Testament, “LORD” is distinguished from “Lord” (Genesis 19:24; Hosea 1:4).
The LORD has a Son (Psalm 2:7, 12; Proverbs 30:2-4).
God the Son is distinguished from God the Father (Psalm 45:6-7; Hebrews 1:8-9).
This shows that Jesus did not consider Himself to be the Father or the Holy Spirit.
Consider also all the other times in the Gospels where Jesus speaks to the Father.
Was He speaking to Himself?
He spoke to another Person in the Trinity—the Father.
No.
4) Each member of the Trinity is God.
The Father is God (John 6:27; Romans 1:7; 1 Peter 1:2).
The Father is God (John 6:27; Romans 1:7; 1 Peter 1:2).
The Holy Spirit is God (Acts 5:3-4; 1 Corinthians 3:16).
No.
5) There is subordination within the Trinity.
Scripture shows that the Holy Spirit is subordinate to the Father and the Son, and the Son is subordinate to the Father.
This is an internal relationship and does not deny the deity of any Person of the Trinity.
This is simply an area which our finite minds cannot understand concerning the infinite God.
Concerning the Son see Luke 22:42, John 5:36, John 20:21, and 1 John 4:14.
Concerning the Holy Spirit see John 14:16, 14:26, 15:26, 16:7, and especially John 16:13-14.
5) There is subordination within the Trinity.
6) The individual members of the Trinity have different tasks.
The Father initiates all of these things.
The Son is the agent through whom the Father does the following works: the creation and maintenance of the universe (1 Corinthians 8:6; John 1:3; Colossians 1:16-17); divine revelation (John 1:1, 16:12-15; Matthew 11:27; Revelation 1:1); and salvation (2 Corinthians 5:19; Matthew 1:21; John 4:42).
The Father initiates all of these things.
The Holy Spirit is the means by whom the Father does the following works: creation and maintenance of the universe (Genesis 1:2; Job 26:13; Psalm 104:30); divine revelation (John 16:12-15; Ephesians 3:5; 2 Peter 1:21); salvation (John 3:6; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:2); and Jesus’ works (Isaiah 61:1; Acts 10:38).
The Father does all these things through the Son, who functions as His agent.
The Holy Spirit is the means by whom the Father does the following works: creation and maintenance of the universe (Genesis 1:2; Job 26:13; Psalm 104:30); divine revelation (John 16:12-15; Ephesians 3:5; 2 Peter 1:21); salvation (John 3:6; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:2); and Jesus’ works (Isaiah 61:1; Acts 10:38).
Thus, the Father does all these things by the power of the Holy Spirit.
So, while these illustrations may give us a picture of the Trinity, the picture is not entirely accurate.
The egg (or apple) fails in that the shell, white, and yolk are parts of the egg, not the egg in themselves, just as the skin, flesh, and seeds of the apple are parts of it, not the apple itself.
The egg (or apple) fails in that the shell, white, and yolk are parts of the egg, not the egg in themselves, just as the skin, flesh, and seeds of the apple are parts of it, not the apple itself.
The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not parts of God; each of them is God.
The water illustration is somewhat better, but it still fails to adequately describe the Trinity.
Liquid, vapor, and ice are forms of water.
The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not parts of God; each of them is God.
So, while these illustrations may give us a picture of the Trinity, the picture is not entirely accurate.
An infinite God cannot be fully described by a finite illustration.
The doctrine of the Trinity has been a divisive issue throughout the entire history of the Christian church.
While the core aspects of the Trinity are clearly presented in God’s Word, some of the side issues are not as explicitly clear.
The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God—but there is only one God.
That is the biblical doctrine of the Trinity.
Beyond that, the issues are, to a certain extent, debatable and non-essential.
Rather than attempting to fully define the Trinity with our finite human minds, we would be better served by focusing on the fact of God’s greatness and His infinitely higher nature.
“Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
Who has known the mind of the Lord?
Who has known the mind of the Lord?
Or who has been his counselor?” (Romans 11:33-34).

 Within the Christian faith, there is a significant amount of confusion regarding what happens after death.
Some hold that after death, everyone “sleeps” until the final judgment, after which everyone will be sent to heaven or hell.
Others believe that at the moment of death, people are instantly judged and sent to their eternal destinations.
Still others claim that when people die, their souls/spirits are sent to a “temporary” heaven or hell, to await the final resurrection, the final judgment, and then the finality of their eternal destination.
So, what exactly does the Bible say happens after death?
First, for the believer in Jesus Christ, the Bible tells us that after death believers’ souls/spirits are taken to heaven, because their sins are forgiven by having received Christ as Savior (John 3:16, 18, 36).
It seems that while the souls/spirits of believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, the physical body remains in the grave “sleeping.” At the resurrection of believers, the physical body is resurrected, glorified, and then reunited with the soul/spirit.
For believers, death is to be “away from the body and at home with the Lord” (2 Corinthians 5:6-8; Philippians 1:23).
However, passages such as 1 Corinthians 15:50-54 and 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 describe believers being resurrected and given glorified bodies.
If believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, what is the purpose of this resurrection?
It seems that while the souls/spirits of believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, the physical body remains in the grave “sleeping.” At the resurrection of believers, the physical body is resurrected, glorified, and then reunited with the soul/spirit.
It seems that while the souls/spirits of believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, the physical body remains in the grave “sleeping.” At the resurrection of believers, the physical body is resurrected, glorified, and then reunited with the soul/spirit.
This reunited and glorified body-soul-spirit will be the possession of believers for eternity in the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21-22).
Second, for those who do not receive Jesus Christ as Savior, death means everlasting punishment.
Unbelievers, then, are not sent to hell (the lake of fire) immediately after death, but rather are in a temporary realm of judgment and condemnation.
Luke 16:22-23 describes a rich man being tormented immediately after death.
Revelation 20:11-15 describes all the unbelieving dead being resurrected, judged at the great white throne, and then being cast into the lake of fire.
Unbelievers, then, are not sent to hell (the lake of fire) immediately after death, but rather are in a temporary realm of judgment and condemnation.
Unbelievers, then, are not sent to hell (the lake of fire) immediately after death, but rather are in a temporary realm of judgment and condemnation.
The rich man cried out, “I am in agony in this fire” (Luke 16:24).
The rich man cried out, “I am in agony in this fire” (Luke 16:24).
Therefore, after death, a person resides in a “temporary” heaven or hell.
After this temporary realm, at the final resurrection, a person’s eternal destiny will not change.
The precise “location” of that eternal destiny is what changes.
Believers will ultimately be granted entrance into the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21:1).
Unbelievers will ultimately be sent to the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11-15).
These are the final, eternal destinations of all people—based entirely on whether or not they had trusted Jesus Christ alone for salvation (Matthew 25:46; John 3:36).

Rather, the problem is that they have rejected what they have heard and what is readily seen in nature.
 All people are accountable to God whether or not they have “heard about Him.” The Bible tells us that God has clearly revealed Himself in nature (Romans 1:20) and in the hearts of people (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
If it were not for God’s grace, we would be given over to the sinful desires of our hearts, allowing us to discover how useless and miserable life is apart from Him.
Deuteronomy 4:29 proclaims, “But if from there you seek the LORD your God, you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul.” This verse teaches an important principle—everyone who truly seeks after God will find Him.
People are responsible to God for what God has already revealed to them.

If a person truly desires to know God, God will make Himself known.
The problem is “there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God” (Romans 3:11).
People reject the knowledge of God that is present in nature and in their own hearts, and instead decide to worship a “god” of their own creation.
It is foolish to debate the fairness of God sending someone to hell who never had the opportunity to hear the gospel of Christ.
People are responsible to God for what God has already revealed to them.
The Bible says that people reject this knowledge, and therefore God is just in condemning them to hell.
Instead of debating the fate of those who have never heard, we, as Christians, should be doing our best to make sure they do hear.
We are called to spread the gospel throughout the nations (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8).
We know people reject the knowledge of God revealed in nature, and that must motivate us to proclaim the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ.
Only by accepting God’s grace through the Lord Jesus Christ can people be saved from their sins and rescued from an eternity apart from God.
If we assume that those who never hear the gospel are granted mercy from God, we lose our motivation for evangelism.
We also run into a terrible problem.
If people who never hear the gospel are automatically saved, then it is logical to make sure no one ever hears the gospel—because then there would be a chance they will reject it and be condemned.
The Bible is clear that those who perish without Christ will face an eternity in hell.
Jesus’ mandate to evangelize the whole world is still in force.

 A dictionary definition of a Christian would be something similar to “a person professing belief in Jesus as the Christ or in the religion based on the teachings of Jesus.” While this is a good starting point, like many dictionary definitions, it falls somewhat short of really communicating the biblical truth of what it means to be a Christian.

The word “Christian” is used three times in the New Testament (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Peter 4:16).
Followers of Jesus Christ were first called “Christians” in Antioch (Acts 11:26) because their behavior, activity, and speech were like Christ.
The word “Christian” literally means, “belonging to the party of Christ” or a “follower of Christ.”
  Unfortunately over time, the word “Christian” has lost a great deal of its significance and is often used of someone who is religious or has high moral values but who may or may not be a true follower of Jesus Christ.
Many people who do not believe and trust in Jesus Christ consider themselves Christians simply because they go to church or they live in a “Christian” nation.
But going to church, serving those less fortunate than you, or being a good person does not make you a Christian.
Going to church does not make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile.
Being a member of a church, attending services regularly, and giving to the work of the church does not make you a Christian.
The Bible teaches that the good works we do cannot make us acceptable to God.
Titus 3:5 says, “He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.
He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.” So, a Christian is someone who has been born again by God (John 3:3; John 3:7; 1 Peter 1:23) and has put faith and trust in Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 2:8 tells us that it is “…by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.” 
 A true Christian is a person who has put faith and trust in the person and work of Jesus Christ, including His death on the cross as payment for sins and His resurrection on the third day.
John 1:12 tells us, “Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” The mark of a true Christian is love for others and obedience to God’s Word (1 John 2:4, 10).
A true Christian is indeed a child of God, a part of God’s true family, and one who has been given new life in Jesus Christ.

 A “worldview” refers to a comprehensive conception of the world from a specific standpoint.
A “Christian worldview,” then, is a comprehensive conception of the world from a Christian standpoint.
An individual’s worldview is his “big picture,” a harmony of all his beliefs about the world.
It is his way of understanding reality.
One’s worldview is the basis for making daily decisions and is therefore extremely important.
An apple sitting on a table is seen by several people.
A botanist looking at the apple classifies it.
An artist sees a still-life and draws it.
A grocer sees an asset and inventories it.
A child sees lunch and eats it.
How we look at any situation is influenced by how we look at the world at large.
Every worldview, Christian and non-Christian, deals with at least these three questions:
   3) How can we fix it?
A prevalent worldview today is naturalism, which answers the three questions like this: 1) We are the product of random acts of nature with no real purpose.
2) We do not respect nature as we should.
3) We can save the world through ecology and conservation.
A naturalistic worldview generates many related philosophies such as moral relativism, existentialism, pragmatism, and utopianism.
A Christian worldview, on the other hand, answers the three questions biblically: 1) We are God’s creation, designed to govern the world and fellowship with Him (Genesis 1:27-28; 2:15).
2) We sinned against God and subjected the whole world to a curse (Genesis 3).
3) God Himself has redeemed the world through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ (Genesis 3:15; Luke 19:10), and will one day restore creation to its former perfect state (Isaiah 65:17-25).
A Christian worldview leads us to believe in moral absolutes, miracles, human dignity, and the possibility of redemption.
It is important to remember that a worldview is comprehensive.
It affects every area of life, from money to morality, from politics to art.
True Christianity is more than a set of ideas to use at church.
Christianity as taught in the Bible is itself a worldview.
The Bible never distinguishes between a “religious” and a “secular” life; the Christian life is the only life there is.
Jesus proclaimed Himself “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6) and, in doing so, became our worldview.

 Questions about Worldview
                                                                                         Answer
 The core beliefs of Christianity are summarized in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.
Jesus died for our sins, was buried, was resurrected, and thereby offers salvation to all who will receive Him in faith.
Unique among all other faiths, Christianity is more about a relationship than religious practices.
Instead of adhering to a list of “do’s and don’ts,” the goal of a Christian is to cultivate a close walk with God.
That relationship is made possible because of the work of Jesus Christ and the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
Beyond these core beliefs, there are many other items that are, or at least should be, indicative of what Christianity is and what Christians believe.
Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired, “God-breathed” Word of God and that its teaching is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
Christians believe in one God that exists in three persons—the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.
Christians believe that mankind was created specifically to have a relationship with God, but sin separates all men from God (Romans 3:23; 5:12).
Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ walked this earth, fully God, and yet fully man (Philippians 2:6-11), and died on the cross.
Christians believe that after His death, Christ was buried, He rose again, and now lives at the right hand of the Father, making intercession for the believers forever (Hebrews 7:25).
Christianity proclaims that Jesus’ death on the cross was sufficient to completely pay the sin debt owed by all men and this is what restores the broken relationship between God and man (Hebrews 9:11-14; 10:10; Romans 5:8; 6:23).
Christianity teaches that in order to be saved and be granted entrance into heaven after death, one must place one’s faith entirely in the finished work of Christ on the cross.
If we believe that Christ died in our place and paid the price of our own sins, and rose again, then we are saved.
There is nothing that anyone can do to earn salvation.
We cannot be “good enough” to please God on our own, because we are all sinners (Isaiah 53:6; 64:6-7).
There is nothing more to be done, because Christ has done all the work!
When He was on the cross, Jesus said, “It is finished” (John 19:30), meaning that the work of redemption was completed.
According to Christianity, salvation is freedom from the old sin nature and freedom to pursue a right relationship with God.
Where we were once slaves to sin, we are now slaves to Christ (Romans 6:15-22).
As long as believers live on this earth in their sinful bodies, they will engage in a constant struggle with sin.
However, Christians can have victory in the struggle with sin by studying and applying God’s Word in their lives and being controlled by the Holy Spirit—that is, submitting to the Spirit’s leading in everyday circumstances.
So, while many religious systems require that a person do or not do certain things, Christianity is about believing that Christ died on the cross as payment for our own sins and rose again.
Our sin debt is paid and we can have fellowship with God.
We can have victory over our sin nature and walk in fellowship and obedience with God.
That is true biblical Christianity.

Dispensationalism is a theological system that recognizes these ages ordained by God to order the affairs of the world.
Classical dispensationalism identifies seven dispensations in God’s plan for humanity.
                                                                                         Answer
Dispensationalists hold to a literal interpretation of the Bible as the best hermeneutic.

Classical dispensationalism identifies seven dispensations in God’s plan for humanity.
Classical dispensationalism identifies seven dispensations in God’s plan for humanity.
Dispensationalists hold to a literal interpretation of the Bible as the best hermeneutic.
The literal interpretation gives each word the meaning it would commonly have in everyday usage.
Allowances are made for symbols, figures of speech, and types, of course.
It is understood that even symbols and figurative sayings have literal meanings behind them.
So, for example, when the Bible speaks of “a thousand years” in Revelation 20, dispensationalists interpret it as a literal period of 1,000 years (the dispensation of the Kingdom), since there is no compelling reason to interpret it otherwise.
There are at least two reasons why literalism is the best way to view Scripture.
First, philosophically, the purpose of language itself requires that we interpret words literally.
Language was given by God for the purpose of being able to communicate.
Words are vessels of meaning.
The second reason is biblical.
Every prophecy about Jesus Christ in the Old Testament was fulfilled literally.
The prophecies were literal.
If a literal interpretation is not used in studying the Scriptures, there is no objective standard by which to understand the Bible.
If a literal interpretation is not used in studying the Scriptures, there is no objective standard by which to understand the Bible.
Each person would be able to interpret the Bible as he saw fit.
Biblical interpretation would devolve into “what this passage says to me” instead of “the Bible says.” Sadly, this is already the case in much of what is called Bible study today.
Dispensational theology teaches that there are two distinct peoples of God: Israel and the Church.
Dispensationalists believe that salvation has always been by grace through faith alone—in God in the Old Testament and specifically in God the Son in the New Testament.
Dispensationalists hold that the Church has not replaced Israel in God’s program and that the Old Testament promises to Israel have not been transferred to the Church.
Dispensationalism teaches that the promises God made to Israel in the Old Testament (for land, many descendants, and blessings) will be ultimately fulfilled in the 1000-year period spoken of in Revelation 20.
Dispensationalists believe that, just as God is in this age focusing His attention on the Church, He will again in the future focus His attention on Israel (see Romans 9–11 and Daniel 9:24).
Dispensationalists understand the Bible to be organized into seven dispensations: Innocence (Genesis 1:1—3:7), Conscience (Genesis 3:8—8:22), Human Government (Genesis 9:1—11:32), Promise (Genesis 12:1—Exodus 19:25), Law (Exodus 20:1—Acts 2:4), Grace (Acts 2:4—Revelation 20:3), and the Millennial Kingdom (Revelation 20:4–6).
Each dispensation includes a recognizable pattern of how God worked with people living in the dispensation.
That pattern is 1) a responsibility, 2) a failure, 3) a judgment, and 4) grace to move on.
Dispensationalism, as a system, results in a premillennial interpretation of Christ’s second coming and usually a pretribulational interpretation of the rapture.
To summarize, dispensationalism is a theological system that emphasizes the literal interpretation of Bible prophecy, recognizes a distinction between Israel and the Church, and organizes the Bible into different dispensations or administrations.

 The Bible has a lot to say about the end times.
Nearly every book of the Bible contains prophecy regarding the end times.
Taking all of these prophecies and organizing them can be difficult.
Following is a very brief summary of what the Bible declares will happen in the end times.
Christ will remove all born-again believers from the earth in an event known as the rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-54).
At the judgment seat of Christ, these believers will be rewarded for good works and faithful service during their time on earth or will lose rewards, but not eternal life, for lack of service and obedience (1 Corinthians 3:11-15; 2 Corinthians 5:10).
Christ will remove all born-again believers from the earth in an event known as the rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-54).
The Antichrist (the beast) will come into power and will sign a covenant with Israel for seven years (Daniel 9:27).
This seven-year period of time is known as the “tribulation.” During the tribulation, there will be terrible wars, famines, plagues, and natural disasters.
God will be pouring out His wrath against sin, evil, and wickedness.
The tribulation will include the appearance of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the seven seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments.
About halfway through the seven years, the Antichrist will break the peace covenant with Israel and make war against it.
The Antichrist will commit “the abomination of desolation” and set up an image of himself to be worshiped in the Jerusalem temple (Daniel 9:27; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-10), which will have been rebuilt.
The second half of the tribulation is known as “the great tribulation” (Revelation 7:14) and “the time of Jacob’s trouble” (Jeremiah 30:7).
At the end of the seven-year tribulation, the Antichrist will launch a final attack on Jerusalem, culminating in the battle of Armageddon.
Jesus Christ will return, destroy the Antichrist and his armies, and cast them into the lake of fire (Revelation 19:11-21).
Christ will then bind Satan in the Abyss for 1,000 years and He will rule His earthly kingdom for this thousand-year period (Revelation 20:1-6).
At the end of the thousand years, Satan will be released, defeated again, and then cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:7-10) for eternity.
At the end of the thousand years, Satan will be released, defeated again, and then cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:7-10) for eternity.
Christ then judges all unbelievers (Revelation 20:10-15) at the great white throne judgment, casting them all into the lake of fire.
Christ will then usher in a new heaven and new earth and the New Jerusalem—the eternal dwelling place of believers.
There will be no more sin, sorrow, or death (Revelation 21–22).

 Romans 8:29-30 tells us, “For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
However, predestination is a biblical doctrine.
The key is understanding what predestination means, biblically.
The words translated “predestined” in the Scriptures referenced above are from the Greek word proorizo, which carries the meaning of “determining beforehand,” “ordaining,” “deciding ahead of time.” So, predestination is God determining certain things to occur ahead of time.
According to Romans 8:29-30, God predetermined that certain individuals would be conformed to the likeness of His Son, be called, justified, and glorified.
Essentially, God predetermines that certain individuals will be saved.
Numerous scriptures refer to believers in Christ being chosen (Matthew 24:22, 31; Mark 13:20, 27; Romans 8:33, 9:11, 11:5-7, 28; Ephesians 1:11; Colossians 3:12; 1 Thessalonians 1:4; 1 Timothy 5:21; 2 Timothy 2:10; Titus 1:1; 1 Peter 1:1-2, 2:9; 2 Peter 1:10).
Predestination is the biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved.
God’s choosing to be gracious to some is not unfair to the others.
Why would God choose certain individuals and not others?
The important thing to remember is that no one deserves to be saved.
We have all sinned (Romans 3:23) and are all worthy of eternal punishment (Romans 6:23).
As a result, God would be perfectly just in allowing all of us to spend eternity in hell.
However, God chooses to save some of us.
He is not being unfair to those who are not chosen, because they are receiving what they deserve.
God’s choosing to be gracious to some is not unfair to the others.
No one deserves anything from God; therefore, no one can object if he does not receive anything from God.
An illustration would be a man randomly handing out money to five people in a crowd of twenty.
Would the fifteen people who did not receive money be upset?
Probably so.
Do they have a right to be upset?
No, they do not.
Why?
He is not being unfair to those who are not chosen, because they are receiving what they deserve.
He simply decided to be gracious to some.
If God is choosing who is saved, doesn’t that undermine our free will to choose and believe in Christ?
The Bible says that we have the choice—all who believe in Jesus Christ will be saved (John 3:16; Romans 10:9-10).
The Bible never describes God rejecting anyone who believes in Him or turning away anyone who is seeking Him (Deuteronomy 4:29).
Somehow, in the mystery of God, predestination works hand-in-hand with a person being drawn by God (John 6:44) and believing unto salvation (Romans 1:16).
God predestines who will be saved, and we must choose Christ in order to be saved.
Both facts are equally true.
Romans 11:33 proclaims, “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!”

 Premillennialism is the view that Christ’s second coming will occur prior to His millennial kingdom, and that the millennial kingdom is a literal 1000-year reign of Christ on earth.
In order to understand and interpret the passages in Scripture that deal with end-times events, there are two things that must be clearly understood: a proper method of interpreting Scripture and the distinction between Israel (the Jews) and the church (the body of all believers in Jesus Christ).
First, a proper method of interpreting Scripture requires that Scripture be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its context.
This means that a passage must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the audience to which it is written, those it is written about, whom it is written by, and so on.
It is critical to know the author, intended audience, and historical background of each passage one interprets.
It is also important to remember that Scripture interprets Scripture.
That is, often a passage will cover a topic or subject that is also addressed elsewhere in the Bible.
It is critical to know the author, intended audience, and historical background of each passage one interprets.
Finally, and most importantly, passages must always be taken in their normal, regular, plain, literal meaning unless the context of the passage indicates that it is figurative in nature.
It is crucial to never seek a “deeper, more spiritual” meaning than is presented.
Rather, it encourages the interpreter to not read figurative language into the meaning of a passage unless it is appropriate for that context.
Rather, it encourages the interpreter to not read figurative language into the meaning of a passage unless it is appropriate for that context.
Spiritualizing a passage is dangerous because it moves the basis for accurate interpretation from Scripture to the mind of the reader.
Then, there can be no objective standard of interpretation; instead, Scripture becomes subject to each person’s own impression of what it means.
Second Peter 1:20-21 reminds us that “no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation.
For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”
 God promises Abraham three things here: Abraham would have many descendants, this nation would own and occupy a land, and a universal blessing will come to all mankind out of Abraham’s line (the Jews).
It is crucial to recognize that Israel and the church are distinct because, if this is misunderstood, Scripture will be misinterpreted.
Especially prone to misinterpretation are passages that deal with promises made to Israel (both fulfilled and unfulfilled).
Such promises should not be applied to the church.
Remember, the context of the passage will determine to whom it is addressed and will point to the most correct interpretation.
Genesis 12:1-3: “The LORD had said to Abram, ‘Leave your country, your people and your father’s household and go to the land I will show you.
That is, there was nothing Abraham could do or fail to do that would void the covenant God made.
In Genesis 15:9-17, God ratifies His covenant with Abraham.
By the way this is done, God places sole responsibility for the covenant upon Himself.
That is, there was nothing Abraham could do or fail to do that would void the covenant God made.
Also in this passage, the boundaries are set for the land that the Jews will eventually occupy.
Other passages that deal with the promise of land are Deuteronomy 30:3-5 and Ezekiel 20:42-44.
In 2 Samuel 7:10-17, we see the promise made by God to King David.
Here, God promises David that he will have descendants, and out of those descendants God will establish an eternal kingdom.
This is referring to the rule of Christ during the millennium and forever.
It is important to keep in mind that this promise must be fulfilled literally and has not yet taken place.
Some would believe that the rule of Solomon was the literal fulfillment of this prophecy, but there is a problem with that.
The territory over which Solomon ruled is not held by Israel today, and neither does Solomon rule over Israel today.
Remember that God promised Abraham that his descendants would possess a land forever.
Also, 2 Samuel 7 says that God would establish a king who would rule for eternity.
Solomon could not be a fulfillment of the promise made to David.
Therefore, this is a promise that has yet to be fulfilled.
Now, with all this in mind, examine what is recorded in Revelation 20:1-7.
Now, with all this in mind, examine what is recorded in Revelation 20:1-7.
The thousand years which is repeatedly mentioned in this passage corresponds to Christ’s literal 1000-year reign on the earth.
Solomon could not be a fulfillment of the promise made to David.
The thousand years which is repeatedly mentioned in this passage corresponds to Christ’s literal 1000-year reign on the earth.
God made unconditional covenants with both Abraham and David.
Therefore, this is a promise that has yet to be fulfilled.
A literal, physical rule of Christ is the only way the covenants can be fulfilled as God promised they would.
Applying a literal method of interpretation to Scripture results in the pieces of the puzzle coming together.
All of the Old Testament prophecies of Jesus’ first coming were fulfilled literally.
All of the Old Testament prophecies of Jesus’ first coming were fulfilled literally.
Premillennialism is the only system that agrees with a literal interpretation of God’s covenants and end-times prophecy.

 “Systematic” refers to something being put into a system.
Systematic theology is, therefore, the division of theology into systems that explain its various areas.
For example, many books of the Bible give information about the angels.
No one book gives all the information about the angels.
Systematic theology takes all the information about angels from all the books of the Bible and organizes it into a system called angelology.
That is what systematic theology is all about—organizing the teachings of the Bible into categorical systems.

 The baptism of the Holy Spirit may be defined as that work whereby the Spirit of God places the believer into union with Christ and into union with other believers in the body of Christ at the moment of salvation.
Notice that we “all” have been baptized by the Spirit—all believers have received the baptism, synonymous with salvation, and it is not a special experience for only a few.
The baptism of the Holy Spirit was predicted by John the Baptist (Mark 1:8) and by Jesus before He ascended to heaven: “For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit” (Acts 1:5).

First Corinthians 12:12–13 is the central passage in the Bible regarding the baptism of the Holy Spirit: “For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink” (1 Corinthians 12:13).
Notice that we “all” have been baptized by the Spirit—all believers have received the baptism, synonymous with salvation, and it is not a special experience for only a few.
While Romans 6:1–4 does not mention specifically the Spirit of God, it does describe the believer’s position before God in language similar to the 1 Corinthians passage: “What shall we say, then?
By no means!
Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
This indicates that all believers have had this experience.

We should then exercise our spiritual gifts to keep that body functioning properly as stated in the context of 1 Corinthians 12:13.
If this is the case, Spirit baptism is the reality for every believer, just as “one faith” and “one Father” are.

 The concept of “blasphemy against the Spirit” is mentioned in Mark 3:22–30 and Matthew 12:22–32.
Jesus has just performed a miracle.
A demon-possessed man was brought to Jesus, and the Lord cast the demon out, healing the man of blindness and muteness.
The eyewitnesses to this exorcism began to wonder if Jesus was indeed the Messiah they had been waiting for.
A group of Pharisees, hearing the talk of the Messiah, quickly quashed any budding faith in the crowd: “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons,” they said (Matthew 12:24).
Jesus rebuts the Pharisees with some logical arguments for why He is not casting out demons in the power of Satan (Matthew 12:25–29).
Jesus rebuts the Pharisees with some logical arguments for why He is not casting out demons in the power of Satan (Matthew 12:25–29).
This particular case of blasphemy, however, is called “the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” in Matthew 12:31.
Then He speaks of the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit: “I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come” (verses 31–32).
Blasphemy is also attributing some evil to God or denying Him some good that we should attribute to Him.
Blasphemy is also attributing some evil to God or denying Him some good that we should attribute to Him.
This particular case of blasphemy, however, is called “the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” in Matthew 12:31.
The Pharisees, having witnessed irrefutable proof that Jesus was working miracles in the power of the Holy Spirit, claimed instead that the Lord was possessed by a demon (Matthew 12:24).
The Pharisees, having witnessed irrefutable proof that Jesus was working miracles in the power of the Holy Spirit, claimed instead that the Lord was possessed by a demon (Matthew 12:24).
Notice in Mark 3:30 Jesus is very specific about what the Pharisees did to commit blasphemy against the Holy Spirit: “He said this because they were saying, ‘He has an impure spirit.’”
Yet they chose defiance.
 Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has to do with accusing Jesus Christ of being demon-possessed instead of Spirit-filled.
This particular type of blasphemy cannot be duplicated today.
The Pharisees were in a unique moment in history: they had the Law and the Prophets, they had the Holy Spirit stirring their hearts, they had the Son of God Himself standing right in front of them, and they saw with their own eyes the miracles He did.
They had set their course, and God was going to let them sail into perdition unhindered.
Never before in the history of the world (and never since) had so much divine light been granted to men; if anyone should have recognized Jesus for who He was, it was the Pharisees.
Jesus declared their willful blindness to be unpardonable.

Their blasphemy against the Holy Spirit was their final rejection of God’s grace.
 The immediate result of the Pharisees’ public rejection of Christ (and God’s rejection of them) is seen in the next chapter.
This is another way of saying that their sin would never be forgiven, ever.
The disciples were puzzled at Jesus’ change of teaching method, and Jesus explained His use of parables: “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.

Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand” (Matthew 13:11, 13).
Again, the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit cannot be repeated today, although some people try.
Jesus Christ is not on earth—He is seated at the right hand of God.
No one can personally witness Jesus performing a miracle and then attribute that power to Satan instead of the Spirit.
The unpardonable sin today is the state of continued unbelief.
The Spirit currently convicts the unsaved world of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8).
To resist that conviction and willfully remain unrepentant is to “blaspheme” the Spirit.
There is no pardon, either in this age or in the age to come, for a person who rejects the Spirit’s promptings to trust in Jesus Christ and then dies in unbelief.
The love of God is evident: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
And the choice is clear: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on him” (John 3:36).

 Many people today understand the church as a building.
This is not a biblical understanding of the church.
The word “church” is a translation of the Greek word ekklesia, which is defined as “an assembly” or “called-out ones.” The root meaning of church is not that of a building, but of people.
It is ironic that when you ask people what church they attend, they usually identify a building.
Romans 16:5 says, “Greet the church that is in their house.” Paul refers to the church in their house—not a church building, but a body of believers.
The church is the body of Christ, of which He is the head.
Ephesians 1:22–23 says, “And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.” The body of Christ is made up of all believers in Jesus Christ from the day of Pentecost (Acts 2) until Christ’s return.
The church is the body of Christ, of which He is the head.
The universal church consists of everyone, everywhere, who has a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
“For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink” (1 Corinthians 12:13).
According to the Bible, the church is the body of Christ—all those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ for salvation (John 3:16; 1 Corinthians 12:13).
This verse says that anyone who believes is part of the body of Christ and has received the Spirit of Christ as evidence.
The universal church is comprised of everyone who belongs to Christ.
Ephesians 1:22–23 says, “And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.” The body of Christ is made up of all believers in Jesus Christ from the day of Pentecost (Acts 2) until Christ’s return.
A Baptist church, a Lutheran church, an E-Free church, etc., is not the church, as in the universal church; rather, it is a local church, a local body of believers.
The universal church is comprised of everyone who belongs to Christ.
Members of the universal church should seek fellowship and edification in a local church.
In summary, the church is not a building or a denomination.
According to the Bible, the church is the body of Christ—all those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ for salvation (John 3:16; 1 Corinthians 12:13).
Local churches are gatherings of people who claim the name of Christ.
Members of a local church may or may not be members of the universal church, depending on the genuineness of their faith.
The local church is where believers can fully apply the “body” principles of 1 Corinthians chapter 12—encouraging, teaching, and building one another up in the knowledge and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.

 The first occurrence of speaking in tongues occurred on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2:1-4.
The apostles went out and shared the gospel with the crowds, speaking to them in their own languages: “We hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!” (Acts 2:11).
The Greek word translated tongues literally means “languages.” Therefore, the gift of tongues is speaking in a language a person does not know in order to minister to someone who does speak that language.
In 1 Corinthians chapters 12–14, Paul discusses miraculous gifts, saying, “Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?” (1 Corinthians 14:6).
According to the apostle Paul, and in agreement with the tongues described in Acts, speaking in tongues is valuable to the one hearing God’s message in his or her own language, but it is useless to everyone else unless it is interpreted/translated.
A person with the gift of interpreting tongues (1 Corinthians 12:30) could understand what a tongues-speaker was saying even though he did not know the language that was being spoken.
The tongues interpreter would then communicate the message of the tongues speaker to everyone else, so all could understand.
“For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says” (1 Corinthians 14:13).
Paul’s conclusion regarding tongues that were not interpreted is powerful: “But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue” (1 Corinthians 14:19).
Is the gift of tongues for today?
First Corinthians 13:8 mentions the gift of tongues ceasing, although it connects the ceasing with the arrival of the “perfect” in 1 Corinthians 13:10.
Some point to a difference in the tense of the Greek verbs referring to prophecy and knowledge “ceasing” and that of tongues “being ceased” as evidence for tongues ceasing before the arrival of the “perfect.” While possible, this is not explicitly clear from the text.
Some also point to passages such as Isaiah 28:11 and Joel 2:28-29 as evidence that speaking in tongues was a sign of God’s oncoming judgment.
First Corinthians 14:22 describes tongues as a “sign to unbelievers.” According to this argument, the gift of tongues was a warning to the Jews that God was going to judge Israel for rejecting Jesus Christ as Messiah.
Therefore, when God did in fact judge Israel (with the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70), the gift of tongues would no longer serve its intended purpose.
While this view is possible, the primary purpose of tongues being fulfilled does not necessarily demand its cessation.
Scripture does not conclusively assert that the gift of speaking in tongues has ceased.
At the same time, if the gift of speaking in tongues were active in the church today, it would be performed in agreement with Scripture.
It would be a real and intelligible language (1 Corinthians 14:10).
It would be for the purpose of communicating God’s Word with a person of another language (Acts 2:6-12).
It would be in agreement with the command God gave through the apostle Paul, “If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.
If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God” (1 Corinthians 14:27-28).
It would also be in accordance with 1 Corinthians 14:33, “For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.”
 God can most definitely give a person the gift of speaking in tongues to enable him or her to communicate with a person who speaks another language.
The Holy Spirit is sovereign in the dispersion of the spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12:11).
Just imagine how much more productive missionaries could be if they did not have to go to language school, and were instantly able to speak to people in their own language.
However, God does not seem to be doing this.
Tongues does not seem to occur today in the manner it did in the New Testament, despite the fact that it would be immensely useful.
The vast majority of believers who claim to practice the gift of speaking in tongues do not do so in agreement with the Scriptures mentioned above.
These facts lead to the conclusion that the gift of tongues has ceased or is at least a rarity in God’s plan for the church today.

 Christian baptism is one of two ordinances that Jesus instituted for the church.
Just before His ascension, Jesus said, “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
These instructions specify that the church is responsible to teach Jesus’ word, make disciples, and baptize those disciples.
These things are to be done everywhere (“all nations”) until “the very end of the age.” So, if for no other reason, baptism has importance because Jesus commanded it.
Baptism was practiced before the founding of the church.
Baptism was practiced before the founding of the church.
The Jews of ancient times would baptize proselytes to signify the converts’ “cleansed” nature.
John the Baptist used baptism to prepare the way of the Lord, requiring everyone, not just Gentiles, to be baptized because everyone needs repentance.
However, John’s baptism, signifying repentance, is not the same as Christian baptism, as seen in Acts 18:24–26 and 19:1–7.
Christian baptism has a deeper significance.
Baptism is to be done in the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit—this is what makes it “Christian” baptism.
It is through this ordinance that a person is admitted into the fellowship of the church.
When we are saved, we are “baptized” by the Spirit into the Body of Christ, which is the church.
First Corinthians 12:13 says, “We were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.” Baptism by water is a “reenactment” of the baptism by the Spirit.
Christian baptism is the means by which a person makes a public profession of faith and discipleship.
Christian baptism is the means by which a person makes a public profession of faith and discipleship.
In the waters of baptism, a person says, wordlessly, “I confess faith in Christ; Jesus has cleansed my soul from sin, and I now have a new life of sanctification.”
 Christian baptism illustrates, in dramatic style, the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ.
At the same time, it also illustrates our death to sin and new life in Christ.
As the sinner confesses the Lord Jesus, he dies to sin (Romans 6:11) and is raised to a brand-new life (Colossians 2:12).
Being submerged in the water represents death to sin, and emerging from the water represents the cleansed, holy life that follows salvation.
Romans 6:4 puts it this way: “We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”
 Very simply, baptism is an outward testimony of the inward change in a believer’s life.
Christian baptism is an act of obedience to the Lord after salvation; although baptism is closely associated with salvation, it is not a requirement to be saved.

 A study of the Lord’s Supper is a soul-stirring experience because of the depth of meaning it contains.
It was during the age-old celebration of the Passover on the eve of His death that Jesus instituted a significant new fellowship meal that we observe to this day.
It is an integral part of Christian worship.
It causes us to remember our Lord’s death and resurrection and to look for His glorious return in the future.
The Passover was the most sacred feast of the Jewish religious year.
It commemorated the final plague on Egypt when the firstborn of the Egyptians died and the Israelites were spared because of the blood of a lamb that was sprinkled on their doorposts.
The lamb was then roasted and eaten with unleavened bread.
God’s command was that throughout the generations to come the feast would be celebrated.
The story is recorded in Exodus 12.
During the Last Supper—a Passover celebration—Jesus took a loaf of bread and gave thanks to God.
As He broke it and gave it to His disciples, He said, “‘This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you’” (Luke 22:19-21).
As He broke it and gave it to His disciples, He said, “‘This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you’” (Luke 22:19-21).
He concluded the feast by singing a hymn (Matthew 26:30), and they went out into the night to the Mount of Olives.
It was there that, as predicted, Jesus was betrayed by Judas.
The following day Jesus was crucified.
The accounts of the Lord’s Supper are found in the Gospels (Matthew 26:26-29; Mark 14:17-25; Luke 22:7-22; and John 13:21-30).
The apostle Paul wrote concerning the Lord’s Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23-29.
Paul includes a statement not found in the Gospels: “Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.
We may ask what it means to partake of the bread and the cup “in an unworthy manner.” It may mean to disregard the true meaning of the bread and cup and to forget the tremendous price our Savior paid for our salvation.
Or it may mean to allow the ceremony to become a dead and formal ritual or to come to the Lord’s Supper with unconfessed sin.
In keeping with Paul’s instruction, we should examine ourselves before eating the bread and drinking the cup.
Another statement Paul made that is not included in the gospel accounts is “For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes” (1 Corinthians 11:26).
Another statement Paul made that is not included in the gospel accounts is “For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes” (1 Corinthians 11:26).
From these brief accounts we learn how Jesus used two of the frailest of elements as symbols of His body and blood and established them as a monument to His death.
It was not a monument of carved marble or molded brass, but of bread and wine.
He declared that the bread spoke of His body which would be broken.
It was not a monument of carved marble or molded brass, but of bread and wine.
There was not a broken bone, but His body was so badly tortured that it was hardly recognizable (Psalm 22:12-17; Isaiah 53:4-7).
The wine spoke of His blood, indicating the terrible death He would soon experience.
He, the perfect Son of God, became the fulfillment of the countless Old Testament prophecies concerning a Redeemer (Genesis 3:15; Psalm 22; Isaiah 53).
He, the perfect Son of God, became the fulfillment of the countless Old Testament prophecies concerning a Redeemer (Genesis 3:15; Psalm 22; Isaiah 53).
When He said, “Do this in remembrance of me,” He indicated this was a ceremony that must be continued in the future.
It indicated also that the Passover, which required the death of a lamb and looked forward to the coming of the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world, was fulfilled in the Lord’s Supper.
The New Covenant replaced the Old Covenant when Christ, the Passover Lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7), was sacrificed (Hebrews 8:8-13).
The sacrificial system was no longer needed (Hebrews 9:25-28).
The Lord’s Supper/Christian Communion is a remembrance of what Christ did for us and a celebration of what we receive as a result of His sacrifice.

 What is the meaning of life?
How can purpose, fulfillment, and satisfaction in life be found?
How can something of lasting significance be achieved?
Many people have never stopped to consider these important questions.
They look back years later and wonder why their relationships have fallen apart and why they feel so empty, even though they may have achieved what they set out to accomplish.
An athlete who had reached the pinnacle of his sport was once asked what he wished someone would have told him when he first started playing his sport.
He replied, “I wish that someone would have told me that when you reach the top, there’s nothing there.” Many goals reveal their emptiness only after years have been wasted in their pursuit.
In our humanistic culture, people lose sight of the meaning of life.
They pursue many things, thinking that in them they will find meaning and purpose.
Some of these pursuits include business success, wealth, good relationships, sex, entertainment, and doing good to others.
People have testified that, while they achieved their goals of wealth, relationships, and pleasure, there was still a deep void inside, a feeling of emptiness that nothing seemed to fill.
The author of the book of Ecclesiastes looked for the meaning of life in many vain pursuits.
He describes the feeling of emptiness he felt: “Meaningless!
Meaningless!
.
.
.
Utterly meaningless!
Everything is meaningless” (Ecclesiastes 1:2).
King Solomon, the writer of Ecclesiastes, had wealth beyond measure, wisdom beyond any man of his time or ours, hundreds of women, palaces and gardens that were the envy of kingdoms, the best food and wine, and every form of entertainment available.
He said at one point that anything his heart wanted, he pursued (Ecclesiastes 2:10).
And yet he summed up life “under the sun”—life lived as though all there is to life is what we can see with our eyes and experience with our senses—is meaningless.
What explains this void?
God created us for something beyond what we can experience in the here-and-now.
Solomon said of God, “He has also set eternity in the hearts of men” (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
In our hearts we are aware that the “here-and-now” is not all that there is.
In the book of Genesis, we find a clue to the meaning of life in the fact that God created mankind in His image (Genesis 1:26).
This means that we are more like God than we are like anything else.
We also find that, before mankind fell and the curse of sin came upon the earth, the following things were true: 1) God made man a social creature (Genesis 2:18–25); 2) God gave man work (Genesis 2:15); 3) God had fellowship with man (Genesis 3:8); and 4) God gave man dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26).
These facts have significance related to the meaning of life.
God intended mankind to have fulfillment in life, but our condition (especially touching our fellowship with God) was adversely affected by the fall into sin and the resulting curse upon the earth (Genesis 3).
The book of Revelation shows that God is concerned with restoring the meaning of life to us.
God reveals that He will destroy this present creation and create a new heaven and a new earth.
At that time, He will restore full fellowship with redeemed mankind, while the unredeemed will have been judged unworthy and cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11–15).
The curse of sin will be done away with; there will be no more sin, sorrow, sickness, death, or pain (Revelation 21:4).
God will dwell with mankind, and they shall be His children (Revelation 21:7).
Thus, we come full circle: God created us to have fellowship with Him; man sinned, breaking that fellowship; God restores that fellowship fully in the eternal state.
To go through life achieving everything we set out to achieve only to die separated from God for eternity would be worse than futile!
But God has made a way to not only make eternal bliss possible (Luke 23:43) but also life on earth satisfying and meaningful.
How is this eternal bliss and “heaven on earth” obtained?
The meaning of life restored through Jesus Christ
 The real meaning of life, both now and in eternity, is found in the restoration of our relationship with God.
This restoration is only possible through God’s Son, Jesus Christ, who reconciles us to God (Romans 5:10; Acts 4:12; John 1:12; 14:6).
Salvation and eternal life are gained when we trust in Jesus Christ as Savior.
Once that salvation is received by grace through faith, Christ makes us new creations, and we begin the progressive journey of growing closer to Him and learning to rely on Him.
God wants us to know the meaning of life.
Jesus said, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
A “full” life is logically one that is meaningful and devoid of aimless wandering.
The meaning of life is wrapped up in the glory of God.
In calling His elect, God says, “Bring all who claim me as their God, for I have made them for my glory.
It was I who created them” (Isaiah 43:7, NLT).
The reason we were made is for God’s glory.
Any time we substitute our own glory for God’s, we miss the meaning of life.
“If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it” (Matthew 16:24–25).
“Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4).

 Crucial Questions
                                                                                         Answer
 The millennial kingdom is the title given to the 1,000-year reign of Jesus Christ on the earth.
They understand the 1,000 years as merely a figurative way of saying “a long period of time,” not a literal, physical reign of Jesus Christ on the earth.
However, six times in Revelation 20:2-7, the millennial kingdom is specifically said to be 1,000 years in length.
If God wished to communicate “a long period of time,” He could have easily done so without explicitly and repeatedly mentioning an exact time frame.
The Bible tells us that when Christ returns to the earth He will establish Himself as king in Jerusalem, sitting on the throne of David (Luke 1:32–33).
The unconditional covenants demand a literal, physical return of Christ to establish the kingdom.
The Abrahamic Covenant promised Israel a land, a posterity and ruler, and a spiritual blessing (Genesis 12:1–3).
It will be a time of peace (Micah 4:2–4; Isaiah 32:17–18), joy (Isaiah 61:7, 10), and comfort (Isaiah 40:1–2).
The Palestinian Covenant promised Israel a restoration to the land and occupation of the land (Deuteronomy 30:1–10).
The Abrahamic Covenant promised Israel a land, a posterity and ruler, and a spiritual blessing (Genesis 12:1–3).
Because of this, it will be a time of obedience (Jeremiah 31:33), holiness (Isaiah 35:8), truth (Isaiah 65:16), and the knowledge of God (Isaiah 11:9, Habakkuk 2:14).
At the second coming, these covenants will be fulfilled as Israel is re-gathered from the nations (Matthew 24:31), converted (Zechariah 12:10–14), and restored to the land under the rule of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
At the second coming, these covenants will be fulfilled as Israel is re-gathered from the nations (Matthew 24:31), converted (Zechariah 12:10–14), and restored to the land under the rule of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
The Bible speaks of the conditions during the millennium as a perfect environment physically and spiritually.
Because of this, it will be a time of obedience (Jeremiah 31:33), holiness (Isaiah 35:8), truth (Isaiah 65:16), and the knowledge of God (Isaiah 11:9, Habakkuk 2:14).
The Bible also tells us that only believers will enter the millennial kingdom.
Because of this, it will be a time of obedience (Jeremiah 31:33), holiness (Isaiah 35:8), truth (Isaiah 65:16), and the knowledge of God (Isaiah 11:9, Habakkuk 2:14).
It will be a time of peace (Micah 4:2–4; Isaiah 32:17–18), joy (Isaiah 61:7, 10), and comfort (Isaiah 40:1–2).
Revelation 20:2-7 gives the precise time period of the millennial kingdom.
There are countless other passages that point to a literal reign of the Messiah on the earth.
The fulfillment of many of God’s covenants and promises rests on a literal, physical, future kingdom.
There is no solid basis for denying the literal interpretation of the millennial kingdom and its duration being 1,000 years.

 Acts 2:42 could be considered a purpose statement for the church: “They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.” According to this verse, the purposes/activities of the church should be 1) teaching biblical doctrine, 2) providing a place of fellowship for believers, 3) observing the Lord’s supper, and 4) praying.

This is another example of the church promoting fellowship.
The church is to be a place where believers can observe the Lord’s Supper, remembering Christ’s death and shed blood on our behalf (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).
The church is to be a place that promotes prayer, teaches prayer, and practices prayer.
The final purpose of the church according to Acts 2:42 is prayer.
The church is to be a place that promotes prayer, teaches prayer, and practices prayer.
 Another commission given to the church is proclaiming the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8).
The church is called to be faithful in sharing the gospel through word and deed.
Some final purposes of the church are given in James 1:27: “Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.” The church is to be about the business of ministering to those in need.
The church is to be a “lighthouse” in the community, pointing people toward our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

The church is to be a “lighthouse” in the community, pointing people toward our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
The church is to both promote the gospel and prepare its members to proclaim the gospel (1 Peter 3:15).

This includes not only sharing the gospel, but also providing for physical needs (food, clothing, shelter) as necessary and appropriate.
The church is also to equip believers in Christ with the tools they need to overcome sin and remain free from the pollution of the world.
This is done by biblical teaching and Christian fellowship.
So, what is the purpose of the church?
Paul gave an excellent illustration to the believers in Corinth.
The church is God’s hands, mouth, and feet in this world—the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-27).
We are to be doing the things that Jesus Christ would do if He were here physically on the earth.
The church is to be “Christian,” “Christ-like,” and Christ-following.

 The word rapture does not occur in the Bible.
The term comes from a Latin word meaning “a carrying off, a transport, or a snatching away.” The concept of the “carrying off” or the rapture of the church is clearly taught in Scripture.
The rapture of the church is the event in which God “snatches away” all believers from the earth in order to make way for His righteous judgment to be poured out on the earth during the tribulation period.
The rapture is described primarily in 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18 and 1 Corinthians 15:50–54.
God will resurrect all believers who have died, give them glorified bodies, and take them from the earth, along with all living believers, who will also be given glorified bodies at that time.
God will resurrect all believers who have died, give them glorified bodies, and take them from the earth, along with all living believers, who will also be given glorified bodies at that time.
The rapture will involve an instantaneous transformation of our bodies to fit us for eternity.
“For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
“We know that when he [Christ] appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).
The rapture is to be distinguished from the second coming.
At the rapture, the Lord comes “in the clouds” to meet us “in the air” (1 Thessalonians 4:17).
At the second coming, the Lord descends all the way to the earth to stand on the Mount of Olives, resulting in a great earthquake followed by a defeat of God’s enemies (Zechariah 14:3–4).
The doctrine of the rapture was not taught in the Old Testament, which is why Paul calls it a “mystery” now revealed: “Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
The doctrine of the rapture was not taught in the Old Testament, which is why Paul calls it a “mystery” now revealed: “Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:51–52).
The rapture of the church is a glorious event we should all be longing for.
We will finally be free from sin.
We will be in God’s presence forever.
There is far too much debate over the meaning and scope of the rapture.
This is not God’s intent.
Rather, the rapture should be a comforting doctrine full of hope; God wants us to “encourage each other with these words” (1 Thessalonians 4:18).

 Fast food restaurants entice us by allowing us to order our food exactly the way we want it.
Some coffee shops boast over a hundred different flavors and varieties of coffee.
Even when buying houses and cars, we can look for one with all the options and features we desire.
Choice is king!
You can find about anything you want according to your own personal likes and needs.
So how about a religion that is just right for you?
How about a religion that is guilt-free, makes no demands, and is not encumbered with a lot of bothersome do’s and don’ts?
It is out there, just as I have described.
But is religion something to be chosen like a favorite flavor of ice cream?
How about a religion that is guilt-free, makes no demands, and is not encumbered with a lot of bothersome do’s and don’ts?
There are a lot of voices vying for our attention, so why should anyone consider Jesus above, say, Muhammad or Confucius, Buddha, or Charles Taze Russell, or Joseph Smith?
After all, don’t all roads lead to Heaven?
Aren’t all religions basically the same?
The truth is that all religions do not lead to Heaven, just as all roads do not lead to Indiana.
Jesus alone speaks with the authority of God because Jesus alone conquered death.
Muhammad, Confucius, and the others molder in their graves to this very day.
But Jesus, by His own power, walked away from the tomb three days after dying on a cruel Roman cross.
Anyone with power over death deserves to be heard.

Could the disciples have stolen His body?
Considering His closest followers had fled in fear at His arrest and crucifixion, it is most unlikely this ragtag band of frightened fishermen would have gone head to head against trained, professional soldiers.
Nor would they have sacrificed their lives and become martyrs—as most of them did—for a fraud.
The simple fact is that the resurrection of Jesus cannot be explained away!
Again, anyone who has power over death deserves to be heard.
Jesus proved His power over death; therefore, we need to hear what He says.

But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.

 The second coming of Jesus Christ is the hope of believers that God is in control of all things, and is faithful to the promises and prophecies in His Word.
In His first coming, Jesus Christ came to earth as a baby in a manger in Bethlehem, just as prophesied.
Jesus fulfilled many of the prophecies of the Messiah during His birth, life, ministry, death, and resurrection.
However, there are some prophecies regarding the Messiah that Jesus has not yet fulfilled.
The second coming of Christ will be the return of Christ to fulfill these remaining prophecies.
In His first coming, Jesus was the suffering Servant.
In His second coming, Jesus will be the conquering King.
In His first coming, Jesus arrived in the most humble of circumstances.
In His second coming, Jesus will arrive with the armies of heaven at His side.
The Old Testament prophets did not make clearly this distinction between the two comings.
This can be seen in Isaiah 7:14, 9:6-7 and Zechariah 14:4.
As a result of the prophecies seeming to speak of two individuals, many Jewish scholars believed there would be both a suffering Messiah and a conquering Messiah.
What they failed to understand is that there is only one Messiah and He would fulfill both roles.
Jesus fulfilled the role of the suffering servant (Isaiah chapter 53) in His first coming.
Jesus will fulfill the role of Israel’s deliverer and King in His second coming.
Zechariah 12:10 and Revelation 1:7, describing the second coming, look back to Jesus being pierced.
Israel, and the whole world, will mourn for not having accepted the Messiah the first time He came.
After Jesus ascended into heaven, the angels declared to the apostles, “‘Men of Galilee,’ they said, ‘why do you stand here looking into the sky?
This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven’” (Acts 1:11).
Zechariah 14:4 identifies the location of the second coming as the Mount of Olives.
Matthew 24:30 declares, “At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn.
 The second coming is spoken of in greatest detail in Revelation 19:11-16, “I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True.
His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns.
He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean.
‘He will rule them with an iron scepter.’ He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”

 The substitutionary atonement refers to Jesus Christ dying as a substitute for sinners.
The Scriptures teach that all men are sinners (Romans 3:9-18, 23).
The penalty for our sinfulness is death.
Romans 6:23 reads, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
  That verse teaches us several things.
Without Christ, we are going to die and spend an eternity in hell as payment for our sins.
 The substitutionary atonement refers to Jesus Christ dying as a substitute for sinners.
The death spoken of here refers to the life in hell.
The death spoken of here refers to the life in hell.
However, the second thing this verse teaches us is that eternal life is available through Jesus Christ.
Without Christ, we are going to die and spend an eternity in hell as payment for our sins.
Jesus Christ died in our place when He was crucified on the cross.
We deserved to be the ones placed on that cross to die because we are the ones who live sinful lives.
But Christ took the punishment on Himself in our place—He substituted Himself for us and took what we rightly deserved.
“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21).
“He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed” (1 Peter 2:24).
Here again we see that Christ took the sins we committed onto Himself to pay the price for us.
“He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed” (1 Peter 2:24).
Not only do these verses teach us about the substitute that Christ was for us, but they also teach that He was the atonement, meaning He satisfied the payment due for the sinfulness of man.
One more passage that talks about the substitutionary atonement is Isaiah 53:5.
This verse talks about the coming Christ who was to die on the cross for our sins.
The prophecy is very detailed, and the crucifixion happened just as it was foretold.
Not only do these verses teach us about the substitute that Christ was for us, but they also teach that He was the atonement, meaning He satisfied the payment due for the sinfulness of man.
Here again we see that Christ paid the price for us!
We can only pay the price of sin on our own by being punished and placed in hell for all eternity.
But God’s Son, Jesus Christ, came to earth to pay the price of our sins.
Because He did this for us, we now have the opportunity to not only have our sins forgiven, but to spend eternity with Him.
In order to do this, we must place our faith in what Christ did on the cross.
We cannot save ourselves; we need a substitute to take our place.
The death of Jesus Christ is the substitutionary atonement.

This is 70 sevens of years, or 490 years.
The church, made up of all who have trusted in the person and work of the Lord Jesus to save them from being punished for sin, will not be present during the tribulation.
The church is saved from the wrath to come (1 Thessalonians 5:9).
The church is saved from the wrath to come (1 Thessalonians 5:9).
Throughout Scripture, the tribulation is referred to by other names such as the Day of the Lord (Isaiah 2:12; 13:6-9; Joel 1:15; 2:1-31; 3:14; 1 Thessalonians 5:2); trouble or tribulation (Deuteronomy 4:30; Zephaniah 1:1); the great tribulation, which refers to the more intense second half of the seven-year period (Matthew 24:21); time or day of trouble (Daniel 12:1; Zephaniah 1:15); time of Jacob’s trouble (Jeremiah 30:7).
This passage speaks of 70 weeks that have been declared against “your people.” Daniel’s people are the Jews, the nation of Israel, and Daniel 9:24 speaks of a period of time that God has given “to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.” God declares that “seventy sevens” will fulfill all these things.
This is 70 sevens of years, or 490 years.
(Some translations refer to 70 weeks of years.)
An understanding of Daniel 9:24-27 is necessary in order to understand the purpose and time of the tribulation.
In verses 25 and 26, Daniel is told that the Messiah will be cut off after “seven sevens and sixty-two sevens” (69 total), beginning with the decree to rebuild Jerusalem.
In other words, 69 sevens of years (483 years) after the decree to rebuild Jerusalem, the Messiah will be cut off.
Biblical historians confirm that 483 years passed from the time of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the time when Jesus was crucified.
Most Christian scholars, regardless of their view of eschatology (future things/events), have the above understanding of Daniel’s 70 sevens.
With 483 years having passed from the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the cutting off of the Messiah, this leaves one seven-year period to be fulfilled in terms of Daniel 9:24: “to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.” This final seven-year period is known as the tribulation period—it is a time when God finishes judging Israel for its sin.
With 483 years having passed from the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the cutting off of the Messiah, this leaves one seven-year period to be fulfilled in terms of Daniel 9:24: “to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.” This final seven-year period is known as the tribulation period—it is a time when God finishes judging Israel for its sin.
And on a wing of the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.” The person of whom this verse speaks is the person Jesus calls the “abomination that causes desolation” (Matthew 24:15) and is called “the beast” in Revelation 13.
Daniel 9:27 says that the beast will make a covenant for seven years, but in the middle of this week (3 1/2 years into the tribulation), he will break the covenant, putting a stop to sacrifice.
Revelation 13 explains that the beast will place an image of himself in the temple and require the world to worship him.
Revelation 13:5 says that this will go on for 42 months, which is 3 1/2 years.
Since Daniel 9:27 says that this will happen in the middle of the week, and Revelation 13:5 says that the beast will do this for a period of 42 months, it is easy to see that the total length of time is 84 months or seven years.
Also see Daniel 7:25, where the “time, times, and half a time” (time=1 year; times=2 years; half a time=1/2 year; total of 3 1/2 years) also refers to “great tribulation,” the last half of the seven-year tribulation period when the beast will be in power.
The additional days in Daniel 12 may include the time at the end for the judgment of the nations (Matthew 25:31-46) and time for the setting up of Christ’s millennial kingdom (Revelation 20:4-6).

The hunger that you feel is a spiritual hunger, and can only be filled by Jesus.
The reason you feel hungry, the reason you seem to be lost in darkness, the reason you cannot find meaning in life, is that you are separated from God.

The Bible tells us that we have all sinned and are therefore separated from God (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23).
How can this problem be solved?
Jesus is the way of salvation!
Jesus took your sin upon Himself (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus is the way of salvation!
Jesus died in your place (Romans 5:8), taking the punishment that you deserve.
Three days later, Jesus rose from the dead, proving His victory over sin and death (Romans 6:4–5).
Three days later, Jesus rose from the dead, proving His victory over sin and death (Romans 6:4–5).
Why did He do it?

Jesus answered that question Himself: “Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13).
Jesus took your sin upon Himself (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus died so that you could live.
If you place your faith in Jesus, trusting His death as the payment for your sins, all of your sins are forgiven and washed away.
You will then have your spiritual hunger satisfied.
The lights will be turned on.
You will have access to a fulfilling life.
You will know your true best friend and good shepherd.
You will know that you have life after you die—a resurrected life in heaven for eternity with Jesus!

 Matthew 24:5–8 gives us some important clues for discerning the approach of the end times: “Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many.
 Matthew 24:5–8 gives us some important clues for discerning the approach of the end times: “Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many.
In this passage, though, we are given a warning: we are not to be deceived, because these events are only the beginning of birth pains; the end is still to come.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
All these are the beginning of birth pains.” An increase in false messiahs, an increase in warfare, and increases in famines, plagues, and natural disasters—these are signs of the end times.
In this passage, though, we are given a warning: we are not to be deceived, because these events are only the beginning of birth pains; the end is still to come.
Some interpreters point to every earthquake, every political upheaval, and every attack on Israel as a sure sign that the end times are rapidly approaching.
While the events may signal the approach of the last days, they are not necessarily indicators that the end times have arrived.
The last days are described as “perilous times” because of the increasingly evil character of man and people who actively “oppose the truth” (2 Timothy 3:1–9; see also 2 Thessalonians 2:3).
Other possible signs would include a rebuilding of a Jewish temple in Jerusalem, increased hostility toward Israel, and advances toward a one-world government.
The most prominent sign of the end times, however, is the nation of Israel.
God promised Abraham that his posterity would have Canaan as “an everlasting possession” (Genesis 17:8), and Ezekiel prophesied a physical and spiritual resuscitation of Israel (Ezekiel 37).
Having Israel as a nation in its own land is important in light of end-times prophecy because of Israel’s prominence in eschatology (Daniel 10:14; 11:41; Revelation 11:8).
With these signs in mind, we can be wise and discerning in regard to the expectation of the end times.
We should not, however, interpret any of these singular events as a clear indication of the soon arrival of the end times.
God has given us enough information that we can be prepared, and that is what we are called to be as our hearts cry out, “Come, Lord Jesus” (Revelation 22:20).

 The timing of the rapture in relation to the tribulation is one of the most controversial issues in the church today.
The three primary views are pre-tribulational (the rapture occurs before the tribulation), mid-tribulational (the rapture occurs at or near the mid-point of the tribulation), and post-tribulational (the rapture occurs at the end of the tribulation).
A fourth view, commonly known as pre-wrath, is a slight modification of the mid-tribulational position.
First, it is important to recognize the purpose of the tribulation.
According to Daniel 9:27, there is a seventieth “seven” (seven years) that is still yet to come.
Daniel’s entire prophecy of the seventy sevens (Daniel 9:20-27) is speaking of the nation of Israel.
It is a time period in which God focuses His attention especially on Israel.
The seventieth seven, the tribulation, must also be a time when God deals specifically with Israel.
While this does not necessarily indicate that the church could not also be present, it does bring into question why the church would need to be on the earth during that time.
The primary Scripture passage on the rapture is 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18.
It states that all living believers, along with all believers who have died, will meet the Lord Jesus in the air and will be with Him forever.
The rapture is God’s removing of His people from the earth.
A few verses later, in 1 Thessalonians 5:9, Paul says, “For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.” The book of Revelation, which deals primarily with the time period of the tribulation, is a prophetic message of how God will pour out His wrath upon the earth during the tribulation.
It seems inconsistent for God to promise believers that they will not suffer wrath and then leave them on the earth to suffer through the wrath of the tribulation.
The fact that God promises to deliver Christians from wrath shortly after promising to remove His people from the earth seems to link those two events together.
Another crucial passage on the timing of the rapture is Revelation 3:10, in which Christ promises to deliver believers from the “hour of trial” that is going to come upon the earth.
This could mean two things.
Either Christ will protect believers in the midst of the trials, or He will deliver believers out of the trials.
Both are valid meanings of the Greek word translated “from.” However, it is important to recognize what believers are promised to be kept from.
It is not just the trial, but the “hour” of trial.
Christ is promising to keep believers from the very time period that contains the trials, namely the tribulation.
The purpose of the tribulation, the purpose of the rapture, the meaning of 1 Thessalonians 5:9, and the interpretation of Revelation 3:10 all give clear support to the pre-tribulational position.
If the Bible is interpreted literally and consistently, the pre-tribulational position is the most biblically-based interpretation.

 After Jesus said, “It is finished,” on the cross, “he bowed his head and gave up his spirit” (John 19:30).
 After Jesus said, “It is finished,” on the cross, “he bowed his head and gave up his spirit” (John 19:30).

 After Jesus said, “It is finished,” on the cross, “he bowed his head and gave up his spirit” (John 19:30).
Three days later, His body and spirit were reunited, and He rose from the dead (John 20).
There is some speculation about where Jesus was—that is, where His spirit was—for the three days between His death and resurrection.
The clearest indication we have in Scripture of where Jesus was between His death and resurrection comes in His conversation on the cross with one of the thieves crucified next to Him.
So, after His death, Jesus went to the place of blessing where God is—heaven.
The clearest indication we have in Scripture of where Jesus was between His death and resurrection comes in His conversation on the cross with one of the thieves crucified next to Him.
The believing thief asks to be remembered when Jesus comes into His kingdom (Luke 23:42), and Jesus replies, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise” (verse 43).
Some take this to mean that Jesus, sometime between His death and resurrection, went to hell/Hades and made an announcement of some type to the “spirits” imprisoned there.
In the discussion of where Jesus was for the three days between His death and resurrection, another passage is often mentioned.
Peter does not tell us what Jesus proclaimed to the imprisoned spirits, but it could not have been a message of redemption, since angels cannot be saved (Hebrews 2:16).
Peter does not tell us what Jesus proclaimed to the imprisoned spirits, but it could not have been a message of redemption, since angels cannot be saved (Hebrews 2:16).
First Peter 3:18–20 says, “Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared” (ESV).
Peter does not tell us what Jesus proclaimed to the imprisoned spirits, but it could not have been a message of redemption, since angels cannot be saved (Hebrews 2:16).
Peter does not tell us what Jesus proclaimed to the imprisoned spirits, but it could not have been a message of redemption, since angels cannot be saved (Hebrews 2:16).
The word now in 1 Peter 3:19 is provided for clarity in the Amplified Bible and the New American Standard Bibles of 1977 and 1995, and it contrasts with the “long ago” (NIV) and “formerly” (ESV) of 1 Peter 3:20.
That wicked generation heard the message, rejected it, perished in the flood, and are now in prison.
That wicked generation heard the message, rejected it, perished in the flood, and are now in prison.
Rather, Peter is giving parenthetical information about something Jesus had done previously in history, namely, that He had “in spirit” preached to the people of Noah’s day while they were still living on earth.
To better explain, here is a paraphrase of 1 Peter 3:18–20: “Jesus was put to death in the flesh, but He was made alive in the Spirit (it was through this same Spirit that Jesus long ago preached to those who are right now in prison—those souls who disobeyed during the time of God’s great patience when Noah was building the ark).” According to this view, Jesus preached spiritually to the people of Noah’s time, and He did this through the prophet Noah, in much the same way that God speaks through us today when we proclaim God’s Word.
The word now in 1 Peter 3:19 is provided for clarity in the Amplified Bible and the New American Standard Bibles of 1977 and 1995, and it contrasts with the “long ago” (NIV) and “formerly” (ESV) of 1 Peter 3:20.
The ESV puts it that Christ “led a host of captives.” Some say this refers to an event not elsewhere described in Scripture, namely, that Jesus gathered all the redeemed who were in paradise and took them to their permanent dwelling in heaven.
The word now in 1 Peter 3:19 is provided for clarity in the Amplified Bible and the New American Standard Bibles of 1977 and 1995, and it contrasts with the “long ago” (NIV) and “formerly” (ESV) of 1 Peter 3:20.
Ephesians 4:8–10 is another passage used in the discussion regarding Jesus’ activities in the three days between His death and resurrection.
Quoting Psalm 68:18, Paul says about Christ, “When he ascended on high, he took many captives” (Ephesians 4:8).
The ESV puts it that Christ “led a host of captives.” Some say this refers to an event not elsewhere described in Scripture, namely, that Jesus gathered all the redeemed who were in paradise and took them to their permanent dwelling in heaven.
The only thing we know for sure is that, according to Jesus’ on words on the cross, He went to paradise.
That is, after securing their salvation on the cross, Jesus brought Abraham, David, Joshua, Daniel, the beggar Lazarus, the thief on the cross, and everyone else who had previously been justified by faith, and led them from Hades (the abode of the dead in general) to their new spiritual home.
All of this is to say that the Bible gives scant information about what exactly Christ did for the three days between His death and resurrection.
In His triumph, Jesus had defeated and taken captive our spiritual enemies: the devil, death, and the curse of sin.
We can also say with confidence that, His work of redemption finished, Jesus did not have to suffer in hell.

 A common argument from atheists and skeptics is that if all things need a cause, then God must also need a cause.
The conclusion is that if God needed a cause, then God is not God (and if God is not God, then of course there is no God).
The conclusion is that if God needed a cause, then God is not God (and if God is not God, then of course there is no God).
The conclusion is that if God needed a cause, then God is not God (and if God is not God, then of course there is no God).
So, if God is a “something,” then He must have a cause, right?
The question is tricky because it sneaks in the false assumption that God came from somewhere and then asks where that might be.
The answer is that the question does not even make sense.
It is like asking, “What does blue smell like?” Blue is not in the category of things that have a smell, so the question itself is flawed.
The question is tricky because it sneaks in the false assumption that God came from somewhere and then asks where that might be.
In the same way, God is not in the category of things that are created or caused.
God is the uncaused Being that caused everything else to come into existence.
How do we know this?
We know that from nothing, nothing comes.
So, if there were ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence, then nothing would have ever come into existence.
But things do exist.
Therefore, since there could never have been absolutely nothing, something had to have always been in existence.
God is the uncaused Being that caused everything else to come into existence.
God is the uncaused Being that caused everything else to come into existence.
God is the uncreated Creator who created the universe and everything in it.

 Unlike the question “Does God exist?” the question of whether Jesus Christ existed is asked by relatively few people.
Most accept that Jesus was truly a man who lived in Israel 2,000 years ago.
The debate begins with the discussion of Jesus’ full identity.
Almost every major religion teaches that Jesus was a prophet or a good teacher or a godly man.
But the Bible tells us that Jesus was infinitely more than a prophet, a good teacher, or a godly man.
C.
S. Lewis in his book Mere Christianity writes the following: “I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him [Jesus Christ]: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God.’ That is the one thing we must not say.
A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.
He would either be a lunatic—on a level with a man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of hell.
You must make your choice.
Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse.
You can shut him up for fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God.
But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.
He has not left that option open to us.
He did not intend to” (Macmillan, 1952, p. 55–56).
So, who did Jesus claim to be?
Who does the Bible say He is?
First, He is God in the flesh.
Jesus said in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” At first glance, this might not seem to be a claim to be God.
However, look at the Jews’ reaction to His statement.
They tried to stone Him “for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God” (John 10:33).
The Jews understood Jesus’ statement as a claim to be God.
In the following verses, Jesus never corrects the Jews or attempts to clarify His statement.
He never says, “I did not claim to be God.” When Jesus said, “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30), He truly was claiming equality with God.
In John 8:58 Jesus claims pre-existence, an attribute of God: “‘I tell you the truth,’ Jesus answered, ‘before Abraham was born, I am!’” In response to this statement, the Jews again took up stones to stone Jesus (John 8:59).
In claiming pre-existence, Jesus applied a name for God to Himself—I AM (see Exodus 3:14).
The Jews rejected Jesus’ identity as God Incarnate, but they understood exactly what He was saying.
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
The apostle Paul describes Jesus as “our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).
The apostle Peter says the same, calling Jesus “our God and Savior” (2 Peter 1:1).
God the Father bears witness of Jesus’ identity as well: “But about the Son he says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom’” (Hebrews 1:8; cf.
Psalm 45:6).
Old Testament prophecies such as Isaiah 9:6 announce the deity of Christ: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.
And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace” (emphasis added).
Why is the question of Jesus’ identity so important?
Why does it matter whether Jesus is God?
Several reasons:
 • As C. S. Lewis pointed out, if Jesus is not God, then Jesus is the worst of liars and untrustworthy in every way.
• If Jesus is not God, then the apostles would likewise have been liars.
• Jesus had to be God because the Messiah was promised to be the “Holy One” (Psalm 16:5, NASB).
Since no one on earth is righteous before God (Psalm 53:1; 143:2), God Himself had to enter the world as a human.
• If Jesus is not God, His death would have been insufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2).
Only God Himself could provide an infinite, eternally valuable sacrifice (Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus had to be both God and man.
As God, Jesus could satisfy God’s wrath.
As a man, Jesus had the capability of dying.
As the God-man, Jesus is the perfect Mediator between heaven and earth (1 Timothy 2:5).
Salvation is available only through faith in Jesus Christ.
As He proclaimed, “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).

The Bible also tells us that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, a being with a mind, emotions, and a will.
The fact that the Holy Spirit is God is clearly seen in many Scriptures, including Acts 5:3-4.
In this verse Peter confronts Ananias as to why he lied to the Holy Spirit and tells him that he had “not lied to men but to God.” It is a clear declaration that lying to the Holy Spirit is lying to God.

In this verse Peter confronts Ananias as to why he lied to the Holy Spirit and tells him that he had “not lied to men but to God.” It is a clear declaration that lying to the Holy Spirit is lying to God.
We can also know that the Holy Spirit is God because He possesses the characteristics of God.
For example, His omnipresence is seen in Psalm 139:7-8, “Where can I go from your Spirit?
Where can I flee from your presence?
Where can I flee from your presence?
If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.” Then in 1 Corinthians 2:10-11, we see the characteristic of omniscience in the Holy Spirit.
The Holy Spirit thinks and knows (1 Corinthians 2:10).
In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.”
For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man’s spirit within him?
The Holy Spirit is God, the third Person of the Trinity.
 We can know that the Holy Spirit is indeed a divine person because He possesses a mind, emotions, and a will.
The Holy Spirit thinks and knows (1 Corinthians 2:10).
The Holy Spirit can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30).
    Is the Holy Spirit a person?
He makes decisions according to His will (1 Corinthians 12:7-11).
The Holy Spirit is God, the third Person of the Trinity.
As God, the Holy Spirit can truly function as the Comforter and Counselor that Jesus promised He would be (John 14:16, 26, 15:26).

 The Bible does not specifically say who Cain’s wife was.
The only possible answer is that Cain’s wife was his sister or niece or great-niece, etc.
The Bible does not say how old Cain was when he killed Abel (Genesis 4:8).
Since they were both farmers, they were likely both full-grown adults, possibly with families of their own.
Adam and Eve surely had given birth to more children than just Cain and Abel at the time Abel was killed.
They definitely had many more children later (Genesis 5:4).
The fact that Cain was scared for his own life after he killed Abel (Genesis 4:14) indicates that there were likely many other children and perhaps even grandchildren of Adam and Eve already living at that time.
Cain’s wife (Genesis 4:17) was a daughter or granddaughter of Adam and Eve.
Since Adam and Eve were the first (and only) human beings, their children would have no other choice than to intermarry.
God did not forbid inter-family marriage until much later when there were enough people to make intermarriage unnecessary (Leviticus 18:6-18).
The reason that incest today often results in genetic abnormalities is that when two people of similar genetics (i.e., a brother and sister) have children together, there is a high risk of their recessive characteristics becoming dominant.

The human genetic code has become increasingly “polluted” over the centuries as genetic defects are multiplied, amplified, and passed down from generation to generation.
Adam and Eve did not have any genetic defects, and that enabled them and the first few generations of their descendants to have a far greater quality of health than we do now.
Adam and Eve’s children had few, if any, genetic defects.
As a result, it was safe for them to intermarry.

 Genesis 6:1-4 refers to the sons of God and the daughters of men.
There have been several suggestions as to who the sons of God were and why the children they had with daughters of men grew into a race of giants (that is what the word Nephilim seems to indicate).

The weakness of views 2) and 3) is that ordinary human males marrying ordinary human females does not account for why the offspring were “giants” or “heroes of old, men of renown.” Further, why would God decide to bring the flood on the earth (Genesis 6:5-7) when God had never forbidden powerful human males or descendants of Seth to marry ordinary human females or descendants of Cain?
As previously noted, the weakness of the first view is that Matthew 22:30 declares, “At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” However, the text does not say “angels are not able to marry.” Rather, it indicates only that angels do not marry.

The fact that God’s holy angels do not marry or engage in sexual relations does not mean the same is true of Satan and his demons.
Second, Matthew 22:30 is referring to the “angels in heaven.” It is not referring to fallen angels, who do not care about God’s created order and actively seek ways to disrupt God’s plan.
Yes, it is an interesting “contradiction” to say that angels are sexless and then to say that the “sons of God” were fallen angels who procreated with human females.
Yes, it is an interesting “contradiction” to say that angels are sexless and then to say that the “sons of God” were fallen angels who procreated with human females.
It is plausible that angels are capable of taking on human form, even to the point of replicating human sexuality and possibly even reproduction.
Earlier Hebrew interpreters and apocryphal and pseudopigraphal writings are unanimous in holding to the view that fallen angels are the “sons of God” mentioned in Genesis 6:1-4.

It seems that God imprisoned the fallen angels who committed this evil sin, so that the other fallen angels would not do the same (as described in Jude 6).

Satan was created as a holy angel.
Put simply, the Bible defines Satan as an angelic being who fell from his position in heaven due to sin and is now completely opposed to God, doing all in his power to thwart God’s purposes.
The Bible, however, gives us a clear portrait of who Satan is and how he affects our lives.
Put simply, the Bible defines Satan as an angelic being who fell from his position in heaven due to sin and is now completely opposed to God, doing all in his power to thwart God’s purposes.
Satan was created as a holy angel.
Isaiah 14:12 possibly gives Satan’s pre-fall name as Lucifer.
Ezekiel 28:12-14 describes Satan as having been created a cherub, apparently the highest created angel.
Because of his sin, God permanently removed Satan from his exalted position and role.
He is an accuser (Revelation 12:10), a tempter (Matthew 4:3; 1 Thessalonians 3:5), and a deceiver (Genesis 3; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Revelation 20:3).
Satan’s pride led to his fall.
Notice the many “I will” statements in Isaiah 14:12-15.
He counterfeits all that God does, hoping to gain the worship of the world and encourage opposition to God’s kingdom.
Satan is the ultimate source behind every false cult and world religion.
He is an accuser (Revelation 12:10), a tempter (Matthew 4:3; 1 Thessalonians 3:5), and a deceiver (Genesis 3; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Revelation 20:3).
His very name means “adversary” or “one who opposes.” Another of his titles, the devil, means “slanderer.”
 Even though he was cast out of heaven, he still seeks to elevate his throne above God.
He counterfeits all that God does, hoping to gain the worship of the world and encourage opposition to God’s kingdom.
Satan will do anything and everything in his power to oppose God and those who follow God.

 We live in a world of pain and suffering.
There is no one who is not affected by the harsh realities of life, and the question “why do bad things happen to good people?” is one of the most difficult questions in all of theology.
God allowed Satan to do everything he wanted to Job except kill him, and Satan did his worst.
At the outset, we must acknowledge that human beings, who are not eternal, infinite, or omniscient, cannot expect to fully understand God’s purposes and ways.
The book of Job deals with the issue of why God allows bad things to happen to good people.
Job was a righteous man (Job 1:1), yet he suffered in ways that are almost beyond belief.
God allowed Satan to do everything he wanted to Job except kill him, and Satan did his worst.
What was Job’s reaction?
“Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him” (Job 13:15).
The book of Job deals with the issue of why God allows bad things to happen to good people.
Job did not understand why God had allowed the things He did, but he knew God was good and therefore continued to trust in Him.
As hard as it is to acknowledge, we must remember that there are no “good” people, in the absolute sense of the word.
Why do bad things happen to good people?
As hard as it is to acknowledge, we must remember that there are no “good” people, in the absolute sense of the word.
All of us are tainted by and infected with sin (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23; 1 John 1:8).
All of us feel the effects of sin in one way or another.
Sometimes it’s our own personal sin; other times, it’s the sins of others.
We live in a fallen world, and we experience the effects of the fall.
One of those effects is injustice and seemingly senseless suffering.

Christians have an eternal perspective: “We do not lose heart.
Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal” (2 Corinthians 4:16–18).

“We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28).
When Joseph, innocent of wrongdoing, finally came through his horrific sufferings, he was able to see God’s good plan in it all (see Genesis 50:19–21).
So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal” (2 Corinthians 4:16–18).

 The Bible tells us we need to attend church so we can worship God with other believers and be taught His Word for our spiritual growth.
The early church “devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer” (Acts 2:42).
We should follow that example of devotion—and to the same things.
The early church “devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer” (Acts 2:42).
 The Bible tells us we need to attend church so we can worship God with other believers and be taught His Word for our spiritual growth.
Church attendance is not just a “good suggestion”; it is God’s will for believers.
Hebrews 10:25 says we should “not [be] giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.” Even in the early church, some were falling into the bad habit of not meeting with other believers.
The author of Hebrews says that’s not the way to go.
We need the encouragement that church attendance affords.
Church is the place where believers can love one another (1 John 4:12), encourage one another (Hebrews 3:13), “spur” one another to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), serve one another (Galatians 5:13), instruct one another (Romans 15:14), honor one another (Romans 12:10), and be kind and compassionate to one another (Ephesians 4:32).

When a person trusts Jesus Christ for salvation, he or she is made a member of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27).
For a church body to function properly, all of its “body parts” need to be present and working (1 Corinthians 12:14–20).
Church is the place where believers can love one another (1 John 4:12), encourage one another (Hebrews 3:13), “spur” one another to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), serve one another (Galatians 5:13), instruct one another (Romans 15:14), honor one another (Romans 12:10), and be kind and compassionate to one another (Ephesians 4:32).
It’s not enough to just attend a church; we should be involved in some type of ministry to others, using the spiritual gifts God has given us (Ephesians 4:11–13).
A believer will never reach full spiritual maturity without having that outlet for his gifts, and we all need the assistance and encouragement of other believers (1 Corinthians 12:21–26).
For these reasons and more, church attendance, participation, and fellowship should be regular aspects of a believer’s life.
Weekly church attendance is in no sense “required” for believers, but someone who belongs to Christ should have a desire to worship God, receive His Word, and fellowship with other believers.

As the building materials of God’s “spiritual house,” we naturally have a connection with one another, and that connection is evident every time the Church “goes to church.”

 At the very heart of this question lies a fundamental misunderstanding of what both the Old and New Testaments reveal about the nature of God.
Another way of expressing this same basic thought is when people say, “The God of the Old Testament is a God of wrath while the God of the New Testament is a God of love.” The fact that the Bible is God’s progressive revelation of Himself to us through historical events and through His relationship with people throughout history might contribute to misconceptions about what God is like in the Old Testament as compared to the New Testament.

For example, throughout the Old Testament, God is declared to be a “compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,” (Exodus 34:6; Numbers 14:18; Deuteronomy 4:31; Nehemiah 9:17; Psalm 86:5, 15; 108:4; 145:8; Joel 2:13).
Yet in the New Testament, God’s loving-kindness and mercy are manifested even more fully through the fact that “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
When they willfully sinned against Him and began to worship idols, God would chastise them.
When they willfully sinned against Him and began to worship idols, God would chastise them.
This is much the same way God deals with Christians in the New Testament.
For example, Hebrews 12:6 tells us that “the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”
 In a similar way, throughout the Old Testament we see God’s judgment and wrath poured out on sin.
Likewise, in the New Testament we see that the wrath of God is still “being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness” (Romans 1:18).
So, clearly, God is no different in the Old Testament than He is in the New Testament.
God by His very nature is immutable (unchanging).
While we might see one aspect of His nature revealed in certain passages of Scripture more than other aspects, God Himself does not change.
As we read and study the Bible, it becomes clear that God is the same in the Old and New Testaments.
Even though the Bible is 66 individual books written on two (or possibly three) continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years by more than 40 authors, it remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction.
In it we see how a loving, merciful, and just God deals with sinful men in all kinds of situations.
Truly, the Bible is God’s love letter to mankind.
God’s love for His creation, especially for mankind, is evident all through Scripture.
Throughout the Bible we see God lovingly and mercifully calling people into a special relationship with Himself, not because they deserve it, but because He is a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.
Yet we also see a holy and righteous God who is the Judge of all those who disobey His Word and refuse to worship Him, turning instead to worship gods of their own creation (Romans chapter 1).
Because of God’s righteous and holy character, all sin—past, present, and future—must be judged.
Yet God in His infinite love has provided a payment for sin and a way of reconciliation so that sinful man can escape His wrath.
We see this wonderful truth in verses like 1 John 4:10: “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.” In the Old Testament, God provided a sacrificial system whereby atonement could be made for sin.
However, this sacrificial system was only temporary and merely looked forward to the coming of Jesus Christ who would die on the cross to make a complete substitutionary atonement for sin.
The Savior who was promised in the Old Testament is fully revealed in the New Testament.
Only envisioned in the Old Testament, the ultimate expression of God’s love, the sending of His Son Jesus Christ, is revealed in all its glory in the New Testament.
Both the Old and the New Testaments were given “to make us wise unto salvation” (2 Timothy 3:15).
When we study the Testaments closely, it is evident that God “does not change like shifting shadows” (James 1:17).

 The doctrine of the virgin birth is crucially important (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:27, 34).
In response to Mary’s question, “How will this be?” (Luke 1:34), Gabriel says, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you” (Luke 1:35).
The angel encourages Joseph to not fear marrying Mary with these words: “What is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 1:20).
Matthew states that the virgin “was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 1:18).
Galatians 4:4 also teaches the Virgin Birth: “God sent His Son, born of a woman.”
 From these passages, it is certainly clear that Jesus’ birth was the result of the Holy Spirit working within Mary’s body.
This He received from Mary.
Mary, of course, could not impregnate herself, and in that sense she was simply a “vessel.” Only God could perform the miracle of the Incarnation.
Mary, of course, could not impregnate herself, and in that sense she was simply a “vessel.” Only God could perform the miracle of the Incarnation.
However, denying a physical connection between Mary and Jesus would imply that Jesus was not truly human.
Scripture teaches that Jesus was fully human, with a physical body like ours.
This He received from Mary.
The Virgin Birth circumvented the transmission of the sin nature and allowed the eternal God to become a perfect man.
At the same time, Jesus was fully God, with an eternal, sinless nature (John 1:14; 1 Timothy 3:16; Hebrews 2:14-17.)
Jesus was not born in sin; that is, He had no sin nature (Hebrews 7:26).
It would seem that the sin nature is passed down from generation to generation through the father (Romans 5:12, 17, 19).

 A dictionary definition of “religion” would be something similar to “belief in God or gods to be worshiped, usually expressed in conduct and ritual; any specific system of belief, worship, etc., often involving a code of ethics.” In light of this definition, the Bible does speak of organized religion, but in many cases the purpose and impact of “organized religion” are not something that God is pleased with.

In Genesis chapter 11, perhaps the first instance of organized religion, the descendants of Noah organized themselves to build the tower of Babel instead of obeying God’s command to fill the entire earth.
They believed that their unity was more important than their relationship with God.
However, many have misunderstood this and have worshiped the rules and rituals rather than God.
In Exodus chapter 6 and following, God “organized” a religion for the nation of Israel.
The Ten Commandments, the laws regarding the tabernacle, and the sacrificial system were all instituted by God and were to be followed by the Israelites.
Further study of the New Testament clarifies that the intent of this religion was to point to the need for a Savior-Messiah (Galatians 3; Romans 7).
In Genesis chapter 11, perhaps the first instance of organized religion, the descendants of Noah organized themselves to build the tower of Babel instead of obeying God’s command to fill the entire earth.
Throughout Israel’s history, many of the conflicts experienced by the Israelites involved conflict with organized religions.
Examples include the worship of Baal (Judges 6; 1 Kings 18), Dagon (1 Samuel 5), and Molech (2 Kings 23:10).
God defeated the followers of these religions, displaying His sovereignty and omnipotence.
In the Gospels, the Pharisees and Sadducees are depicted as the representatives of organized religion at the time of Christ.
Jesus constantly confronted them about their false teachings and hypocritical lifestyles.
In the Epistles, there were organized groups that mixed the gospel with certain lists of required works and rituals.
God calls these groups of organized believers “churches.” The descriptions from the book of Acts and the Epistles indicate that the church is to be organized and interdependent.
In the book of Revelation, organized religion will have an impact on the world as the Antichrist sets up a one-world religion.
In many cases, the end result of organized religion is a distraction from the intent of God.
However, the Bible does speak of organized believers who are part of His plan.
God calls these groups of organized believers “churches.” The descriptions from the book of Acts and the Epistles indicate that the church is to be organized and interdependent.
The organization leads to protection, productivity, and outreach (Acts 2:41-47).
In the case of the church, it could better be called an “organized relationship.” 
 Religion is man’s attempt to have communion with God.
The Christian faith is a relationship with God because of what He has done for us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
There is no plan to reach God (He has reached out to us—Romans 5:8).
There is no pride (all is received by grace—Ephesians 2:8-9).
There should be no conflict over leadership (Christ is the head—Colossians 1:18).
There should be no prejudice (we are all one in Christ—Galatians 3:28).
Being organized is not the problem.
Focusing on the rules and rituals of a religion is the problem.

 Our hearts go out to those who have thoughts of ending their own lives through suicide.
If that is you right now, it may speak of many emotions, such as feelings of hopelessness and despair.
You may feel like you are in the deepest pit, and you doubt there is any hope of things getting better.
No one seems to care or understand where you are coming from.
Life just is not worth living...or is it?
If you will take a few moments to consider letting God truly be God in your life right now, He will prove how big He really is, “for nothing is impossible with God” (Luke 1:37).

That may lead to self-pity, anger, bitterness, vengeful thoughts, or unhealthy fears that have caused problems in some of your most important relationships.

He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor…to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve…to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.”

 We should read and study the Bible because it is God’s Word to us.
The Bible is literally "God-breathed" (2 Timothy 3:16).
In other words, it is God’s very words to us.
There are so many questions that philosophers have asked that God answers for us in Scripture.
What is the purpose to life?
Where did I come from?
Is there life after death?
How do I get to heaven?
Why is the world full of evil?
Why do I struggle to do good?
In addition to these "big" questions, the Bible gives much practical advice in areas such as: What do I look for in a mate?
How can I have a successful marriage?
How can I be a good friend?
How can I be a good parent?
What is success and how do I achieve it?
How can I change?
What really matters in life?
How can I live so that I do not look back with regret?
How can I handle the unfair circumstances and bad events of life victoriously?
We should read and study the Bible because it is totally reliable and without error.
Similarly, we are given assurance that God’s Word is true when it discusses spiritual areas that we cannot test with our senses by showing itself true in those areas that we can test, such as historical accuracy, scientific accuracy, and prophetic accuracy.
Those who say the Bible has errors have their ears closed to the truth.
Jesus once asked which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven you," or "Rise, take up your bed and walk."
Similarly, we are given assurance that God’s Word is true when it discusses spiritual areas that we cannot test with our senses by showing itself true in those areas that we can test, such as historical accuracy, scientific accuracy, and prophetic accuracy.
We should read and study the Bible because God does not change and because mankind’s nature does not change; it is as relevant for us as it was when it was written.

While technology changes, mankind’s nature and desires do not change.
We find, as we read the pages of biblical history, that whether we are talking about one-on-one relationships or societies, "there is nothing new under the sun" (Ecclesiastes 1:9).

And while mankind as a whole continues to seek love and satisfaction in all of the wrong places, God—our good and gracious Creator—tells us what will bring us lasting joy.
His revealed Word, the Bible, is so important that Jesus said of it, "Man does not live on bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).
In other words, if we want to live life to the fullest, as God intended, we must listen to and heed God’s written Word.
We should read and study the Bible because there is so much false teaching.
The Bible gives us the measuring stick by which we can distinguish truth from error.
To have a wrong impression of God is to worship an idol or false god.

The Bible tells us how one truly gets to heaven, and it is not by being good or by being baptized or by anything else we do (John 14:6; Ephesians 2:1-10; Isaiah 53:6; Romans 3:10-18, 5:8, 6:23, 10:9-13).
Along this line, God’s Word shows us just how much God loves us (Romans 5:6-8; John 3:16).
And it is in learning this that we are drawn to love Him in return (1 John 4:19).
The Bible equips us to serve God (2 Timothy 3:17; Ephesians 6:17; Hebrews 4:12).
It helps us know how to be saved from our sin and its ultimate consequence (2 Timothy 3:15).

Meditating on God’s Word and obeying its teachings will bring success in life (Joshua 1:8; James 1:25).
God’s Word helps us see sin in our lives and helps us get rid of it (Psalm 119:9, 11).
It gives us guidance in life, making us wiser than our teachers (Psalm 32:8, 119:99; Proverbs 1:6).
It gives us guidance in life, making us wiser than our teachers (Psalm 32:8, 119:99; Proverbs 1:6).
The Bible keeps us from wasting years of our lives on that which does not matter and will not last (Matthew 7:24-27).
Reading and studying the Bible helps us see beyond the attractive "bait" to the painful "hook" in sinful temptations, so that we can learn from others' mistakes rather than making them ourselves.
Experience is a great teacher, but when it comes to learning from sin, it is a terribly hard teacher.
It is so much better to learn from others' mistakes.
There are so many Bible characters to learn from, some of whom can serve as both positive and negative role models at different times in their lives.
For example, David, in his defeat of Goliath, teaches us that God is greater than anything He asks us to face (1 Samuel 17), while his giving in to the temptation to commit adultery with Bathsheba reveals just how long-lasting and terrible the consequences of a moment’s sinful pleasure can be (2 Samuel 11).

The Bible is a book that is not merely for reading.
It is a book for studying so that it can be applied.
Otherwise, it is like swallowing food without chewing and then spitting it back out again—no nutritional value is gained by it.
The Bible is God’s Word.
As such, it is as binding as the laws of nature.
We can ignore it, but we do so to our own detriment, just as we would if we ignored the law of gravity.
It cannot be emphasized strongly enough just how important the Bible is to our lives.
Studying the Bible can be compared to mining for gold.
If we make little effort and merely "sift through the pebbles in a stream," we will only find a little gold dust.
