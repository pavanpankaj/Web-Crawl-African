 The key to understanding the relationship between the Christian and the Law is knowing that the Old Testament law was given to the nation of Israel, not to Christians.
 The key to understanding the relationship between the Christian and the Law is knowing that the Old Testament law was given to the nation of Israel, not to Christians.
Some of the laws were to reveal to the Israelites how to obey and please God (the Ten Commandments, for example).
Some of the laws were to show the Israelites how to worship God and atone for sin (the sacrificial system).
Some of the laws were intended to make the Israelites distinct from other nations (the food and clothing rules).
None of the Old Testament law is binding on Christians today.
When Jesus died on the cross, He put an end to the Old Testament law (Romans 10:4; Galatians 3:23–25; Ephesians 2:15).
In place of the Old Testament law, Christians are under the law of Christ (Galatians 6:2), which is to “love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind…and to love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37-39).
If we obey those two commands, we will be fulfilling all that Christ requires of us: “All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments” (Matthew 22:40).
Now, this does not mean the Old Testament law is irrelevant today.
Many of the commands in the Old Testament law fall into the categories of “loving God” and “loving your neighbor.” The Old Testament law can be a good guidepost for knowing how to love God and knowing what goes into loving your neighbor.
At the same time, to say that the Old Testament law applies to Christians today is incorrect.
The Old Testament law is a unit (James 2:10).
Either all of it applies, or none of it applies.
If Christ fulfilled some of it, such as the sacrificial system, He fulfilled all of it.
And his commands are not burdensome” (1 John 5:3).
The Ten Commandments were essentially a summary of the entire Old Testament law.
Nine of the Ten Commandments are clearly repeated in the New Testament (all except the command to observe the Sabbath day).
We are to love God and love our neighbors.
If we are loving our neighbors, we will not be murdering them, lying to them, committing adultery against them, or coveting what belongs to them.
The purpose of the Old Testament law is to convict people of our inability to keep the law and point us to our need for Jesus Christ as Savior (Romans 7:7-9; Galatians 3:24).
The Old Testament law was never intended by God to be the universal law for all people for all of time.
We are to love God and love our neighbors.
If we obey those two commands faithfully, we will be upholding all that God requires of us.
 Does God Exist?
 Does God Exist?
Bolstering faith are human experience, logic, and empirical evidence, all of which help answer the question does God exist?
We trust in what is known, leading us to action, despite a less-than-absolute understanding (Hebrews 11:6).
Bolstering faith are human experience, logic, and empirical evidence, all of which help answer the question does God exist?
However, that chain of causes cannot go on infinitely into the past, or else the chain would never actually start.
Airtight, sound arguments will remain unconvincing to those determined to disbelieve.
That means a certain amount of “faith” is necessary—and not just regarding God’s existence.
Logic points to God: the uncreated, eternal measure of all other things, the First Cause of our reality.
Each effect is the result of some cause, and each cause is the effect of a prior cause.
Nothing about subatomic particles or forces indicates they must be arranged as they are.
Evidence of God exists in daily human experiences (Romans 1:19–20; Psalm 19:1; Ecclesiastes 3:11).
The largest galactic configurations, our solar system, our DNA, subatomic particles—everything gives the appearance of having been purposefully arranged.
That’s the essence of biblical faith, including faith in the existence of God.
Often, this question is posed as “Can you prove God exists?” The problem is that, while truth itself is absolute, there are virtually zero instances of absolute proof outside of pure logic and mathematics.
There will always be a gap between what we can “know” and what we “believe.” This applies equally to skeptics and believers.
Those who ignore or disdain God’s invitation don’t have the excuse of ignorance (Romans 1:18; Psalm 14:1).

 Three of the more powerful logical suggestions of God’s existence are the cosmological, teleological, and moral arguments.

For that reason, courtrooms don’t require absolute proof to reach a verdict; rather, they seek to dispel “reasonable doubt” and consider what’s “most probable.”
 Discussing the existence of God usually starts with logical arguments.
Further, discussion of moral ideas leads inevitably to a crossroads.
Beyond that, the fundamental content of human morals remains constant throughout history and across cultures.
Such actions all express a measure of faith.
Human life compels belief that truth, deception, love, hate, goodness, evil, etc., are real and meaningful.

 The Bible does not give any explicit teaching on whether pets/animals have “souls” or whether pets/animals will be in heaven.
 The Bible does not give any explicit teaching on whether pets/animals have “souls” or whether pets/animals will be in heaven.
 The Bible does not give any explicit teaching on whether pets/animals have “souls” or whether pets/animals will be in heaven.
However, we can use general biblical principles to develop some clarity on the subject.
The Bible states that both man (Genesis 2:7) and animals (Genesis 1:30; 6:17; 7:15, 22) have the “breath of life”; that is, both man and animals are living beings.
The primary difference between human beings and animals is that humanity is made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27), while animals are not.
Being made in the image and likeness of God means that human beings are like God, capable of spirituality, with mind, emotion, and will, and they have a part of their being that continues after death.
If pets/animals do have a “soul” or immaterial aspect, it must therefore be of a different and lesser “quality.” This difference possibly means that pet/animal “souls” do not continue in existence after death.
If pets/animals do have a “soul” or immaterial aspect, it must therefore be of a different and lesser “quality.” This difference possibly means that pet/animal “souls” do not continue in existence after death.
Another factor to consider regarding whether pets will be heaven is that animals are a part of God’s creative process in Genesis.
God created the animals and said they were good (Genesis 1:25).
Therefore, there is no reason why there could not be pets / animals on the new earth (Revelation 21:1).
There will most definitely be animals during the millennial kingdom (Isaiah 11:6; 65:25).
It is impossible to say definitively whether some of these animals might be the pets we had while here on earth.
We do know that God is just and that when we get to heaven we will find ourselves in complete agreement with His decision on this issue, whatever it may be.
If eternal security is not true, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in error.
 When people come to know Christ as their Savior, they are brought into a relationship with God that guarantees their eternal security.
Jude 24 declares, "To Him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before His glorious presence without fault and with great joy."
Our eternal security is a result of God keeping us, not us maintaining our own salvation.
The Lord Jesus Christ proclaimed, "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.
Our eternal security is purchased by Christ, promised by the Father, and sealed by the Holy Spirit.
Who could possibly separate us from the grip of both the Father and the Son?
Ephesians 4:30 tells us that believers are "sealed for the day of redemption."
John 3:15-16 tells us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ will "have eternal life."
If eternal security is not true, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in error.
The most powerful argument for eternal security is Romans 8:38-39, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Our eternal security is purchased by Christ, promised by the Father, and sealed by the Holy Spirit.
 The Bible presents a clear path to eternal life.
 The Bible presents a clear path to eternal life.
First, we must recognize that we have sinned against God: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
We have all done things that are displeasing to God, which makes us deserving of punishment.
Since all our sins are ultimately against an eternal God, only an eternal punishment is sufficient.
"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
However, Jesus Christ, the sinless (1 Peter 2:22), eternal Son of God became a man (John 1:1,14) and died to pay our penalty.
"God demonstrates His love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).
Jesus Christ died on the cross (John 19:31-42), taking the punishment that we deserve (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Three days later He rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4), proving His victory over sin and death.
"In His great mercy He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" (1 Peter 1:3).
By faith, we must change our mindset regarding Christ - who He is, what He did, and why - for salvation (Acts 3:19).&nbsp;If we place our faith in Him, trusting His death on the cross to pay for our sins, we will be forgiven and receive the promise of eternal life in heaven.

"For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son so that anyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).
"If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9).
Faith alone in the finished work of Christ on the cross is the only true path to eternal life!
"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, here is a sample prayer.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and deserve punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
No one deserves to be forgiven.
What is forgiveness and why do I need it?
 Acts 13:38 declares, "Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
What is forgiveness and why do I need it?
 The word "forgive" means to wipe the slate clean, to pardon, to cancel a debt.
When we wrong someone, we seek their forgiveness in order for the relationship to be restored.
Forgiveness is not granted because a person deserves to be forgiven.
No one deserves to be forgiven.
Forgiveness is an act of love, mercy, and grace.
 The word "forgive" means to wipe the slate clean, to pardon, to cancel a debt.
The Bible tells us that we are all in need of forgiveness from God.
We have all committed sin.
Ecclesiastes 7:20 proclaims, "There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins."
As a result, we desperately need God’s forgiveness.
If our sins are not forgiven, we will spend eternity suffering the consequences of our sins (Matthew 25:46; John 3:36).
Forgiveness – How do I get it?
Forgiveness is an act of love, mercy, and grace.
2 Peter 3:9 tells us, "…He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."
The only just penalty for our sins is death.
The first half of Romans 6:23 declares, "For the wages of sin is death…" Eternal death is what we have earned for our sins.
God, in His perfect plan, became a human being – Jesus Christ (John 1:1,14).
Jesus died on the cross, taking the penalty that we deserve – death.
Second Corinthians 5:21 teaches us, "God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God."
As God, Jesus’ death provided forgiveness for the sins of the entire world.
1 John 2:2 proclaims, "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."
Praise God, through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the second half of Romans 6:23 is true, "…but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Do you want to have your sins forgiven?
Do you have a nagging feeling of guilt that you can’t seem to get to go away?
Forgiveness of your sins is available if you will place your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.
Ephesians 1:7 says, "In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace."
All you have to do is ask God to forgive you through Jesus, believing that Jesus died to pay for your forgiveness – and He will forgive you!
John 3:16-17 contains this wonderful message, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him."
Forgiveness – is it really that easy?
 Yes it is that easy!
You can’t earn forgiveness from God.
You can’t pay for your forgiveness from God.
You can only receive it, by faith, through the grace and mercy of God.
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and receive forgiveness from God, here is a prayer you can pray.

 Do you know for certain that you have eternal life and that you will go to heaven when you die?
 Do you know for certain that you have eternal life and that you will go to heaven when you die?
God wants you to be sure!
The Bible says: “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (1 John 5:13).
Suppose you were standing before God right now and He asked you, “Why should I let you into heaven?” What would you say?
You may not know what to reply.
What you need to know is that God loves us and has provided a way that we can know for sure where we will spend eternity.
The Bible states it this way: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
We have to first understand the problem that is keeping us from heaven.
The problem is this - our sinful nature keeps us from having a relationship with God.
We are sinners by nature and by choice.
“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).
We cannot save ourselves.
The Bible states it this way: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
We deserve death and hell.
“For the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).
God is holy and just and must punish sin, yet He loves us and has provided forgiveness for our sin.
Jesus said: “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
Jesus died for us on the cross: “For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous to bring you to God” (1 Peter 3:18).
Jesus was resurrected from the dead: “He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification” (Romans 4:25).
So, back to the original question – “How can I know for sure that I will go to heaven when I die?” The answer is this – believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved (Acts 16:31).
“To all who received Him, to those who believed in His Name, He gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).
You can receive eternal life as a FREE gift.
“The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).
You can live a full and meaningful life right now.
Jesus said: “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
You can spend eternity with Jesus in heaven, for He promised: “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you may also be where I am” (John 14:3).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and receive forgiveness from God, here is prayer you can pray.
Saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Jesus Christ that can provide forgiveness of sins.

 It is important to know God’s will.
At its most basic, the will of God is to repent of our sin and trust in Christ.
 It is important to know God’s will.
Jesus said that His true relations are those who know and do the Father’s will: “Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother” (Mark 3:35).
In the parable of the two sons, Jesus rebukes the chief priests and elders for failing to do the will of the Father; specifically, they “did not repent and believe” (Matthew 21:32).
At its most basic, the will of God is to repent of our sin and trust in Christ.
If we have not taken that first step, then we have not yet accepted God’s will.
Once we receive Christ by faith, we are made God’s children (John 1:12), and He desires to lead us in His way (Psalm 143:10).
Once we receive Christ by faith, we are made God’s children (John 1:12), and He desires to lead us in His way (Psalm 143:10).
At its most basic, the will of God is to repent of our sin and trust in Christ.
In fact, He has already given us many, many directions in His Word.
We are to “give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you” (1 Thessalonians 5:18).
We are to do good works (1 Peter 2:15).
And “it is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3).
Knowing God’s will is sometimes difficult because it requires patience.
Romans 12:2 says, “Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
As we seek God’s will, we should make sure what we are considering is not something the Bible forbids.
As we seek God’s will, we should make sure what we are considering is not something the Bible forbids.
For example, the Bible forbids stealing; since God has clearly spoken on the issue, we know it is not His will for us to be bank robbers—we don’t even need to pray about it.
Also, we should make sure what we are considering will glorify God and help us and others grow spiritually.
Knowing God’s will is sometimes difficult because it requires patience.
It’s natural to want to know all of God’s will at once, but that’s not how He usually works.
He reveals to us a step at a time—each move a step of faith—and allows us to continue to trust Him.
The important thing is that, as we wait for further direction, we are busy doing the good that we know to do (James 4:17).
Often, we want God to give us specifics—where to work, where to live, whom to marry, what car to buy, etc.
God allows us to make choices, and, if we are yielded to Him, He has ways of preventing wrong choices (see Acts 16:6–7).
The better we get to know a person, the more acquainted we become with his or her desires.
For example, a child may look across a busy street at the ball that bounced away, but he doesn’t run after it, because he knows “my dad wouldn’t want me to do that.” He doesn’t have to ask his father for advice on every particular situation; he knows what his father would say because he knows his father.
If we are walking closely with the Lord and truly desiring His will for our lives, God will place His desires in our hearts.
As we walk with the Lord, obeying His Word and relying on His Spirit, we find that we are given the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16).
We know Him, and that helps us to know His will.
We know Him, and that helps us to know His will.
“The righteousness of the blameless makes their paths straight, / but the wicked are brought down by their own wickedness” (Proverbs 11:5).
If we are walking closely with the Lord and truly desiring His will for our lives, God will place His desires in our hearts.
The key is wanting God’s will, not our own.
“Delight yourself in the LORD and He will give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4).
 In order to get “right” with God, we must first understand what is “wrong.” The answer is sin.
 In order to get “right” with God, we must first understand what is “wrong.” The answer is sin.
The bad news is that the penalty for sin is death.
“There is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 14:3).
Jesus declared His purpose was “to seek and to save what was lost” (Luke 19:10), and He pronounced His purpose accomplished when He died on the cross with the words, “It is finished!” (John 19:30).
The bad news is that the penalty for sin is death.
“The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4).
The good news is that a loving God has pursued us in order to bring us salvation.
Jesus declared His purpose was “to seek and to save what was lost” (Luke 19:10), and He pronounced His purpose accomplished when He died on the cross with the words, “It is finished!” (John 19:30).
Having a right relationship with God begins with acknowledging your sin.
A beautiful illustration of repentance and forgiveness is the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32).
“For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved” (Romans 10:10).
This repentance must be accompanied by faith – specifically, faith that Jesus’ sacrificial death and miraculous resurrection qualify Him to be your Savior.
“If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9).
Many other passages speak of the necessity of faith, such as John 20:27; Acts 16:31; Galatians 2:16; 3:11, 26; and Ephesians 2:8.
This repentance must be accompanied by faith – specifically, faith that Jesus’ sacrificial death and miraculous resurrection qualify Him to be your Savior.
He sent the Savior, He provided the sacrifice to take away your sin (John 1:29), and He offers you the promise: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Acts 2:21).
A beautiful illustration of repentance and forgiveness is the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32).
The younger son wasted his father’s gift in shameful sin (verse 13).
When he acknowledged his wrongdoing, he decided to return home (verse 18).
He assumed he would no longer be considered a son (verse 19), but he was wrong.
The father loved the returned rebel as much as ever (verse 20).
All was forgiven, and a celebration ensued (verse 24).
God is good to keep His promises, including the promise to forgive.
“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18).
If you want to get right with God, here is a sample prayer.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness – the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
 The Bible does not specifically condemn gambling, betting, or the lottery.
While the Bible does not explicitly mention gambling, it does mention events of “luck” or “chance.” As an example, casting lots is used in Leviticus to choose between the sacrificial goat and the scapegoat.
 The Bible does not specifically condemn gambling, betting, or the lottery.
The Bible does warn us, however, to stay away from the love of money (1 Timothy 6:10; Hebrews 13:5).
Scripture also encourages us to stay away from attempts to “get rich quick” (Proverbs 13:11; 23:5; Ecclesiastes 5:10).
Gambling most definitely is focused on the love of money and undeniably tempts people with the promise of quick and easy riches.
What is wrong with gambling?
Gambling is a difficult issue because if it is done in moderation and only on occasion, it is a waste of money, but it is not necessarily evil.
People waste money on all sorts of activities.
Gambling is no more or less of a waste of money than seeing a movie (in many cases), eating an unnecessarily expensive meal, or purchasing a worthless item.
At the same time, the fact that money is wasted on other things does not justify gambling.
Money should not be wasted.
Excess money should be saved for future needs or given to the Lord’s work, not gambled away.
While the Bible does not explicitly mention gambling, it does mention events of “luck” or “chance.” As an example, casting lots is used in Leviticus to choose between the sacrificial goat and the scapegoat.
Joshua cast lots to determine the allotment of land to the various tribes.
Nehemiah cast lots to determine who would live inside the walls of Jerusalem.
The apostles cast lots to determine the replacement for Judas.
Proverbs 16:33 says, “The lot is cast in the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.”
 What would the Bible say about casinos and lotteries?
Casinos use all sorts of marketing schemes to entice gamblers to risk as much money as possible.
They often offer inexpensive or even free alcohol, which encourages drunkenness, and thereby a decreased ability to make wise decisions.
Everything in a casino is perfectly rigged for taking money in large sums and giving nothing in return, except for fleeting and empty pleasures.
While the Bible does not explicitly mention gambling, it does mention events of “luck” or “chance.” As an example, casting lots is used in Leviticus to choose between the sacrificial goat and the scapegoat.
The allure of “getting rich quick” is too great a temptation to resist for those who are desperate.
The chances of winning are infinitesimal, which results in many peoples’ lives being ruined.
Many people claim to be playing the lottery or gambling so that they can give the money to the church or to some other good cause.
Many people claim to be playing the lottery or gambling so that they can give the money to the church or to some other good cause.
While this may be a good motive, reality is that few use gambling winnings for godly purposes.
Studies show that the vast majority of lottery winners are in an even worse financial situation a few years after winning a jackpot than they were before.
Few, if any, truly give the money to a good cause.
Further, God does not need our money to fund His mission in the world.
Proverbs 13:11 says, “Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow.” God is sovereign and will provide for the needs of the church through honest means.
Would God be honored by receiving donated drug money or money stolen in a bank robbery?
Of course not.
Neither does God need or want money that was “stolen” from the poor in the temptation for riches.
Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” Hebrews 13:5 declares, “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’” Matthew 6:24 proclaims, “No one can serve two masters.
You cannot serve both God and Money.”
 We know that God is real because He has revealed Himself to us in three ways: in creation, in His Word, and in His Son, Jesus Christ.
Based on the watch’s design, I would assume it had a designer.
 We know that God is real because He has revealed Himself to us in three ways: in creation, in His Word, and in His Son, Jesus Christ.
“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse” (Romans 1:20).
“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse” (Romans 1:20).
“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.” (Psalm 19:1).
If I found a wristwatch in the middle of a field, I would not assume that it just “appeared” out of nowhere or that it had always existed.
My assumption would be that there is an intelligent sender of the message, someone who created the code.
The universe displays great design, and this argues for a Great Designer.
Our measurement of time is not based on wristwatches, but on God’s handiwork—the regular rotation of the earth (and the radioactive properties of the cesium-133 atom).
The universe displays great design, and this argues for a Great Designer.
If I found an encoded message, I would seek out a cryptographer to help break the code.
My assumption would be that there is an intelligent sender of the message, someone who created the code.
Mankind has an innate perception that there is more to life than meets the eye, that there is an existence higher than this earthly routine.
Not only has God made an intricate and finely tuned physical world; He has also instilled a sense of eternity in the heart of every person (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
Mankind has an innate perception that there is more to life than meets the eye, that there is an existence higher than this earthly routine.
Our sense of eternity manifests itself in at least two ways: law-making and worship.
Every civilization throughout history has valued certain moral laws, which are surprisingly similar from culture to culture.
For example, the ideal of love is universally esteemed, while the act of lying is universally condemned.
This common morality—this global understanding of right and wrong—points to a Supreme Moral Being who gave us such scruples.
In the same way, people all over the world, regardless of culture, have always cultivated a system of worship.
The object of worship may vary, but the sense of a “higher power” is an undeniable part of being human.
Our propensity to worship accords with the fact that God created us “in His own image” (Genesis 1:27).
God has also revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible.
Throughout Scripture, the existence of God is treated as a self-evident fact (Genesis 1:1; Exodus 3:14).
The life-changing nature of the Bible, its integrity, and the miracles which accompanied its writing should be enough to warrant a closer look.
God has also revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible.
The life-changing nature of the Bible, its integrity, and the miracles which accompanied its writing should be enough to warrant a closer look.
The third way in which God revealed Himself is through His Son, Jesus Christ (John 14:6-11).
“In the beginning was the Word: the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:1,14; see also Colossians 2:9).
In Jesus’ amazing life, He kept the entire Old Testament law perfectly and fulfilled the prophecies concerning the Messiah (Matthew 5:17).
He performed countless acts of compassion and public miracles to authenticate His message and bear witness to His deity (John 21:24-25).
Then, three days after His crucifixion, He rose from the dead, a fact affirmed by hundreds of eyewitnesses (1 Corinthians 15:6).
The life-changing nature of the Bible, its integrity, and the miracles which accompanied its writing should be enough to warrant a closer look.
As the Apostle Paul said, this thing “was not done in a corner” (Acts 26:26).
We realize that there will always be skeptics who have their own ideas concerning God and will read the evidence accordingly.
And there will be some whom no amount of proof will convince (Psalm 14:1).
It all comes down to faith (Hebrews 11:6).
Is Jesus God?
— Jesus claimed to be God.
It is correct that the Bible never records Jesus saying the precise words, “I am God.” This does not mean, however, that Jesus never claimed to be God.
 Take for example the words of Jesus in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” We need only to look at the Jews’ reaction to His statement to know He was claiming to be God.
— His followers declared Him to be God.
They tried to stone Him for this very reason: “You, a mere man, claim to be God” (John 10:33, emphasis added).
The Jews understood exactly what Jesus was claiming—deity.
 Some who deny that Jesus is God make the claim that Jesus never said that He is God.
When Jesus declared, “I and the Father are one,” He was saying that He and the Father are of one nature and essence.
John 8:58 is another example.
Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth … before Abraham was born, I am!” This is a reference back to Exodus 3:14 when God revealed Himself as the “I AM.” The Jews who heard this statement responded by taking up stones to kill Him for blasphemy, as the Mosaic Law commanded (Leviticus 24:16).
 John reiterates the concept of Jesus’ deity: “The Word [Jesus] was God” and “the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14).
These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh.
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Jesus Christ.
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Therefore, Jesus is God.
Thomas the disciple declared concerning Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28).
Jesus does not correct him.
Titus 2:13 encourages us to wait for the coming of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ (see also 2 Peter 1:1).
In Hebrews 1:8, the Father declares of Jesus, “But about the Son He says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.’” The Father refers to Jesus as God, indicating that Jesus is indeed God.
In Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10).
Several times in Scripture Jesus receives worship (Matthew 2:11; 14:33; 28:9, 17; Luke 24:52; John 9:38).
Jesus does not correct him.
If Jesus were not God, He would have told people to not worship Him, just as the angel in Revelation did.
Beyond these, there are many other passages of Scripture that argue for Jesus being God.
 The most important reason that Jesus must be God is that, if He is not God, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).
 The most important reason that Jesus must be God is that, if He is not God, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).
Only God could pay such an infinite penalty.
Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death.
 Yes, Jesus is the only way to heaven.
 Yes, Jesus is the only way to heaven.
No one, regardless of reputation, achievement, special knowledge, or personal holiness, can come to God the Father except through Jesus.
The Bible teaches that there is no other way to salvation than through Jesus Christ.
Jesus Himself says in John 14:6, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me.” He is not a way, as in one of many; He is the way, as in the one and only.
No one, regardless of reputation, achievement, special knowledge, or personal holiness, can come to God the Father except through Jesus.
Jesus is the only way to heaven for several reasons.
Jesus was “chosen by God” to be the Savior (1 Peter 2:4).
Jesus is the only One to have come down from heaven and returned there (John 3:13).
He is the only person to have lived a perfect human life (Hebrews 4:15).
He is the only sacrifice for sin (1 John 2:2; Hebrews 10:26).
He alone fulfilled the Law and the Prophets (Matthew 5:17).
He is the only man to have conquered death forever (Hebrews 2:14–15).
He is the only Mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5).
Peter, speaking to the Sanhedrin, clearly proclaimed Jesus as the only way to heaven: “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).
Jesus spoke of Himself as the only way to heaven in several places besides John 14:6.
He presented Himself as the object of faith in Matthew 7:21–27.
He said His words are life (John 6:63).
He promised that those who believe in Him will have eternal life (John 3:14–15).
He is the gate of the sheep (John 10:7); the bread of life (John 6:35); and the resurrection (John 11:25).
The apostles’ preaching focused on the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
Peter, speaking to the Sanhedrin, clearly proclaimed Jesus as the only way to heaven: “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).
Paul, speaking to the synagogue in Antioch, singled out Jesus as the Savior: “I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
John, writing to the church at large, specifies the name of Christ as the basis of our forgiveness: “I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name” (1 John 2:12).
Eternal life in heaven is made possible only through Christ.
Jesus prayed, “Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent” (John 17:3).
We must trust in Jesus’ death on the cross as our payment for sin and in His resurrection.
“This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe” (Romans 3:22).
At one point in Jesus’ ministry, many of the crowd were turning their backs on Him and leaving in hopes of finding another savior.
Jesus asked the Twelve, “Do you want to go away as well?” (John 6:67, ESV).
Peter’s reply is exactly right: “Lord, to whom shall we go?
May we all share Peter’s faith that eternal life resides only in Jesus Christ.
You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God” (John 6:68–69, ESV).
May we all share Peter’s faith that eternal life resides only in Jesus Christ.
 Once a person is saved are they always saved?
 Once a person is saved are they always saved?
Yes, when people come to know Christ as their Savior, they are brought into a relationship with God that guarantees their salvation as eternally secure.
Numerous passages of Scripture declare the fact that, as an act of God, salvation is secure:
  (a) Romans 8:30 declares, "And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified."
There is nothing that can prevent a believer from one day being glorified because God has already purposed it in heaven.
Once a person is justified, his salvation is guaranteed—he is as secure as if he is already glorified in heaven.
(b) Paul asks two crucial questions in Romans 8:33-34 "Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
It is God who justifies.
Christ Jesus, who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us."
No one will, because Christ is our advocate.
Who will condemn us?
No one will, because Christ, the One who died for us, is the one who condemns.
We have both the advocate and judge as our Savior.
(c) Believers are born again (regenerated) when they believe (John 3:3; Titus 3:5).
For a Christian to lose his salvation, he would have to be un-regenerated.
The Bible gives no evidence that the new birth can be taken away.
(d) The Holy Spirit indwells all believers (John 14:17; Romans 8:9) and baptizes all believers into the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13).
For a believer to become unsaved, he would have to be "un-indwelt" and detached from the Body of Christ.
(f) In a conclusive argument, Scripture says, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 8:38–39).
Remember the same God who saved you is the same God who will keep you.
Once we are saved, we are always saved.
Our salvation is most definitely eternally secure!
Is salvation by faith alone, or by faith plus works?
 This is perhaps the most important question in all of Christian theology.
This question is the cause of the Reformation, the split between the Protestant churches and Catholic Church.
This question is a key difference between biblical Christianity and most of the “Christian” cults.
Is salvation by faith alone, or by faith plus works?
Am I saved just by believing in Jesus, or do I have to believe in Jesus and do certain things?
The question of faith alone or faith plus works is made difficult by some hard-to-reconcile Bible passages.
Compare Romans 3:28, 5:1 and Galatians 3:24 with James 2:24.
Some see a difference between Paul (salvation is by faith alone) and James (salvation is by faith plus works).
Paul dogmatically says that justification is by faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9), while James appears to be saying that justification is by faith plus works.
This apparent problem is answered by examining what exactly James is talking about.
James is refuting the belief that a person can have faith without producing any good works (James 2:17-18).
James is emphasizing the point that genuine faith in Christ will produce a changed life and good works (James 2:20-26).
James is not saying that justification is by faith plus works, but rather that a person who is truly justified by faith will have good works in his/her life.
If a person claims to be a believer, but has no good works in his/her life, then he/she likely does not have genuine faith in Christ (James 2:14, 17, 20, 26).
Paul says the same thing in his writings.
The good fruit believers should have in their lives is listed in Galatians 5:22-23.
Immediately after telling us that we are saved by faith, not works (Ephesians 2:8-9), Paul informs us that we were created to do good works (Ephesians 2:10).
Paul expects just as much of a changed life as James does: “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
James and Paul do not disagree in their teaching regarding salvation.
They approach the same subject from different perspectives.
Paul simply emphasized that justification is by faith alone while James put emphasis on the fact that genuine faith in Christ produces good works.
If the Bible is the Word of God, then to dismiss it is to dismiss God Himself.
 Our answer to this question will not only determine how we view the Bible and its importance to our lives, but also it will ultimately have an eternal impact on us.
If the Bible is truly God’s Word, then we should cherish it, study it, obey it, and fully trust it.
If the Bible is the Word of God, then to dismiss it is to dismiss God Himself.
The fact that God gave us the Bible is an evidence and illustration of His love for us.
The term “revelation” simply means that God communicated to mankind what He is like and how we can have a right relationship with Him.
Although God’s revelation of Himself in the Bible was given progressively over approximately 1500 years, it has always contained everything man needs to know about God in order to have a right relationship with Him.
If the Bible is truly the Word of God, then it is the final authority for all matters of faith, religious practice, and morals.
Is there any evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word?
What is unique about the Bible that sets it apart from all other religious books ever written?
Is there any evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word?
These types of questions must be seriously examined if we are to determine the validity of the Bible’s claim to be the very Word of God, divinely inspired, and totally sufficient for all matters of faith and practice.
There can be no doubt that the Bible does claim to be the very Word of God.
This is clearly seen in Paul’s commendation to Timothy: “… from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:15-17).
There are both internal and external evidences that the Bible is truly God’s Word.
The internal evidences are those things within the Bible that testify of its divine origin.
Another of the internal evidences that indicates the Bible is truly God’s Word is the prophecies contained within its pages.
Even though it is really sixty-six individual books, written on three continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years, by more than 40 authors who came from many walks of life, the Bible remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction.
This unity is unique from all other books and is evidence of the divine origin of the words which God moved men to record.
Another of the internal evidences that indicates the Bible is truly God’s Word is the prophecies contained within its pages.
The Bible contains hundreds of detailed prophecies relating to the future of individual nations including Israel, certain cities, and mankind.
Another of the internal evidences that indicates the Bible is truly God’s Word is the prophecies contained within its pages.
Unlike the prophecies found in other religious books or those by men such as Nostradamus, biblical prophecies are extremely detailed.
There are over three hundred prophecies concerning Jesus Christ in the Old Testament.
Not only was it foretold where He would be born and His lineage, but also how He would die and that He would rise again.
There simply is no logical way to explain the fulfilled prophecies in the Bible other than by divine origin.
There is no other religious book with the extent or type of predictive prophecy that the Bible contains.
A third internal evidence of the divine origin of the Bible is its unique authority and power.
While this evidence is more subjective than the first two, it is no less a powerful testimony of the divine origin of the Bible.
The Bible’s authority is unlike any other book ever written.
This authority and power are best seen in the way countless lives have been transformed by the supernatural power of God’s Word.
Drug addicts have been cured by it, homosexuals set free by it, derelicts and deadbeats transformed by it, hardened criminals reformed by it, sinners rebuked by it, and hate turned to love by it.
The Bible does possess a dynamic and transforming power that is only possible because it is truly God’s Word.
There are also external evidences that indicate the Bible is truly the Word of God.
One is the historicity of the Bible.
Because the Bible details historical events, its truthfulness and accuracy are subject to verification like any other historical document.
The fact that the Bible accurately and truthfully records historically verifiable events is a great indication of its truthfulness when dealing with religious subjects and doctrines and helps substantiate its claim to be the very Word of God.
There are also external evidences that indicate the Bible is truly the Word of God.
The fact that the Bible accurately and truthfully records historically verifiable events is a great indication of its truthfulness when dealing with religious subjects and doctrines and helps substantiate its claim to be the very Word of God.
Another external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the integrity of its human authors.
As mentioned earlier, God used men from many walks of life to record His words.
In studying the lives of these men, we find them to be honest and sincere.
The fact that the Bible accurately and truthfully records historically verifiable events is a great indication of its truthfulness when dealing with religious subjects and doctrines and helps substantiate its claim to be the very Word of God.
The men who wrote the New Testament and many hundreds of other believers (1 Corinthians 15:6) knew the truth of their message because they had seen and spent time with Jesus Christ after He had risen from the dead.
The fact that the Bible accurately and truthfully records historically verifiable events is a great indication of its truthfulness when dealing with religious subjects and doctrines and helps substantiate its claim to be the very Word of God.
Their lives and deaths testify to the fact that the Bible truly is God’s Word.
A final external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the indestructibility of the Bible.
Because of its importance and its claim to be the very Word of God, the Bible has suffered more vicious attacks and attempts to destroy it than any other book in history.
The accuracy which has been preserved despite every attempt to corrupt, attack, or destroy it is clear testimony to the fact that the Bible is truly God’s Word and is supernaturally protected by Him.
From early Roman Emperors like Diocletian, through communist dictators and on to modern-day atheists and agnostics, the Bible has withstood and outlasted all of its attackers and is still today the most widely published book in the world.
From early Roman Emperors like Diocletian, through communist dictators and on to modern-day atheists and agnostics, the Bible has withstood and outlasted all of its attackers and is still today the most widely published book in the world.
Throughout time, skeptics have regarded the Bible as mythological, but archeology has confirmed it as historical.
Opponents have attacked its teaching as primitive and outdated, but its moral and legal concepts and teachings have had a positive influence on societies and cultures throughout the world.
From early Roman Emperors like Diocletian, through communist dictators and on to modern-day atheists and agnostics, the Bible has withstood and outlasted all of its attackers and is still today the most widely published book in the world.
It is a book that has transformed countless lives and cultures throughout the last 2000 years.
No matter how its opponents try to attack, destroy, or discredit it, the Bible remains; its veracity and impact on lives is unmistakable.
The accuracy which has been preserved despite every attempt to corrupt, attack, or destroy it is clear testimony to the fact that the Bible is truly God’s Word and is supernaturally protected by Him.
It should not surprise us that, no matter how the Bible is attacked, it always comes out unchanged and unscathed.
After all, Jesus said, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Mark 13:31).
After looking at the evidence, one can say without a doubt that, yes, the Bible is truly God’s Word.
Is there life after death?
Is there life after death?
 Job, speaking out of his despair, asked, “If a man dies, shall he live again?” (Job 14:14, ESV).
All of us have been challenged by this question.
What happens to us after we die?
Do we simply cease to exist?
Does everyone go to the same place after death, or do we go to different places?
Is there really a heaven and hell?
At death, the body ceases to function and begins the process of returning to the earth, but the spiritual part of man lives on: “The dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7; cf.
At death, the body ceases to function and begins the process of returning to the earth, but the spiritual part of man lives on: “The dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7; cf.
At death, the body ceases to function and begins the process of returning to the earth, but the spiritual part of man lives on: “The dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7; cf.
To those who are redeemed and have their sin forgiven, God gives eternal life, an existence so glorious that “no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9, NLT).
At death, the body ceases to function and begins the process of returning to the earth, but the spiritual part of man lives on: “The dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7; cf.
Jesus Christ, God incarnate, came to the earth to pay for our sins and give us the gift of eternal life: “He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).
Jesus Christ, God incarnate, came to the earth to pay for our sins and give us the gift of eternal life: “He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).
The resurrection of the Christ is a well-documented event.
The apostle Paul invited people to question the over 500 eyewitnesses who saw Jesus after His resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:6).
All of them could bear testimony to the fact that Jesus is alive and that there is indeed life after death.
Jesus Christ, God incarnate, came to the earth to pay for our sins and give us the gift of eternal life: “He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).
Jesus Christ, God incarnate, came to the earth to pay for our sins and give us the gift of eternal life: “He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).
The resurrection of Christ, which gives us the sure hope of life after death, is the cornerstone of the Christian faith (1 Corinthians 15:12–19).
All of them could bear testimony to the fact that Jesus is alive and that there is indeed life after death.
Because Christ was raised from the dead, we have faith that we, too, will be resurrected.
The resurrection of Christ, which gives us the sure hope of life after death, is the cornerstone of the Christian faith (1 Corinthians 15:12–19).
Just as God raised up Jesus’ body, so will our bodies be resurrected upon Jesus’ return (1 Corinthians 6:14).
The fact of life after death does not mean everyone will go to heaven, however.
Each person must make a choice in this life, a choice that will determine his or her eternal destination.
It is appointed for us to die once, and after that will come judgment (Hebrews 9:27).
Those who have been made righteous by faith in Christ will go into eternal life in heaven, but those who have rejected Christ as Savior will be sent to eternal punishment in hell (Matthew 25:46).
Hell, like heaven, is a literal place.
It is a place where the unrighteous will experience the never-ending, eternal wrath of God.
It is a place where the unrighteous will experience the never-ending, eternal wrath of God.
Hell is described as a lake of fire where the inhabitants will be tormented day and night forever and ever (Revelation 20:10).
In hell, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, indicating intense grief and anger (Matthew 13:42).
In hell, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, indicating intense grief and anger (Matthew 13:42).
God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked but desires them to turn from their wicked ways so that they can live (Ezekiel 33:11).
But He will not force us into submission; if we choose to reject Christ, the one and only Savior, we reject the heaven that He has prepared, and we will live eternally apart from Him.
Life on earth is a preparation for what is to come.
For believers in Christ, life after death is eternal life in heaven with God.
But He will not force us into submission; if we choose to reject Christ, the one and only Savior, we reject the heaven that He has prepared, and we will live eternally apart from Him.
For believers in Christ, life after death is eternal life in heaven with God.
But He will not force us into submission; if we choose to reject Christ, the one and only Savior, we reject the heaven that He has prepared, and we will live eternally apart from Him.
Faith in Christ prepares us for life after death: “Whoever believes in [God’s Son] is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son” (John 3:18).
But He will not force us into submission; if we choose to reject Christ, the one and only Savior, we reject the heaven that He has prepared, and we will live eternally apart from Him.
Faith in Christ prepares us for life after death: “Whoever believes in [God’s Son] is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son” (John 3:18).
Faith in Christ prepares us for life after death: “Whoever believes in [God’s Son] is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son” (John 3:18).
For believers in Christ, life after death is eternal life in heaven with God.
For believers in Christ, life after death is eternal life in heaven with God.
We will not be given the opportunity to accept God’s gift of salvation after death.
We will not be given the opportunity to accept God’s gift of salvation after death.
There is only one way—through faith in Jesus Christ.
Our eternal destination is determined in our earthly lifetimes by our reception or rejection of Jesus Christ.
“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them” (John 3:36).
If we trust in the death of Jesus Christ as the full payment for our sin, and we believe in His resurrection from the dead, we are guaranteed eternal life after death, in glory (1 Peter 1:3–5).
We will not be given the opportunity to accept God’s gift of salvation after death.
If we trust in the death of Jesus Christ as the full payment for our sin, and we believe in His resurrection from the dead, we are guaranteed eternal life after death, in glory (1 Peter 1:3–5).
   Return to:
While the Bible does not directly answer this question, there definitely are some biblical principles that can be applied to the issue:
The Bible nowhere explicitly states that masturbation is a sin, but there is no question that the actions that usually lead to masturbation are sinful.
The passage most frequently associated with masturbation is the story of Onan in Genesis 38:9–10.
Some interpret this passage to say that “spilling your seed” is a sin.
However, that is not what the passage is saying.
Onan refused to fulfill his duty to provide an heir for his deceased brother.
The passage is not about masturbation but about fulfilling a family obligation.
A second passage sometimes used as evidence that masturbation is a sin is Matthew 5:27–30.
Jesus speaks against having lustful thoughts and then says, “If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.” While there is clearly a connection between lustful thoughts and masturbation, it is unlikely that Jesus was alluding to the specific sin of masturbation in this passage.
The Bible nowhere explicitly states that masturbation is a sin, but there is no question that the actions that usually lead to masturbation are sinful.
If the sins of lust, immoral thoughts, and pornography are forsaken and overcome, masturbation will become much less of an issue and temptation.
If the sins of lust, immoral thoughts, and pornography are forsaken and overcome, masturbation will become much less of an issue and temptation.
Many people struggle with guilt concerning masturbation, when, in reality, they would be far better off repenting of the sins that lead them to masturbate.
While the Bible does not directly answer this question, there definitely are some biblical principles that can be applied to the issue:
Jesus speaks against having lustful thoughts and then says, “If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.” While there is clearly a connection between lustful thoughts and masturbation, it is unlikely that Jesus was alluding to the specific sin of masturbation in this passage.
 (1) “So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31).
If we cannot give God glory for something, we should not do it.
If we are not fully convinced that an activity is honoring to God, it is a sin.
(2) “Everything that does not come from faith is sin” (Romans 14:23).
If the sins of lust, immoral thoughts, and pornography are forsaken and overcome, masturbation will become much less of an issue and temptation.
(3) “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?
You are not your own; you were bought at a price.
Therefore, honor God with your body” (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).
These great truths should have a powerful impact on what we do with our bodies.
In light of these principles, many conclude that masturbation is always sinful.
Masturbation is a questionable activity, at best—whether it can glorify God; whether it can be done in absolute confidence that it is right; and whether it can honor God as the owner of our bodies.
 The Bible, God’s Word, tells us what God is like and what He is not like.
 The Bible, God’s Word, tells us what God is like and what He is not like.
To say that it is important for us to try to understand what God is like is a huge understatement.
Creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh (Jesus Christ) will help us to know what God is like.
Without the authority of the Bible, any attempt to explain God’s attributes would be no better than an opinion, which by itself is often incorrect, especially in understanding God (Job 42:7).
To say that it is important for us to try to understand what God is like is a huge understatement.
Failure to do so can cause us to set up, chase after, and worship false gods contrary to His will (Exodus 20:3-5).
Only what God has chosen to reveal of Himself can be known.
One of God’s attributes or qualities is “light,” meaning that He is self-revealing in information of Himself (Isaiah 60:19; James 1:17).
The fact that God has revealed knowledge of Himself should not be neglected (Hebrews 4:1).
Creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh (Jesus Christ) will help us to know what God is like.
Let’s start by understanding that God is our Creator and that we are a part of His creation (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 24:1) and are created in His image.
Man is above the rest of creation and was given dominion over it (Genesis 1:26-28).
Creation is marred by the fall but still offers a glimpse of God’s works (Genesis 3:17-18; Romans 1:19-20).
By considering creation’s vastness, complexity, beauty, and order, we can have a sense of the awesomeness of God.
Reading through some of the names of God can be helpful in our search of what God is like.
They are as follows:
       Yahweh - LORD “I Am,” meaning the eternal self-existent God (Exodus 3:13, 14).
God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and His existence will never end.
He is immortal and infinite (Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2; 1 Timothy 1:17).
God is immutable, meaning He is unchanging; this in turn means that God is absolutely reliable and trustworthy (Malachi 3:6; Numbers 23:19; Psalm 102:26, 27).
God is omniscient, meaning He knows the past, present, and future, including what we are thinking at any given moment.
He is unequaled and perfect (2 Samuel 7:22; Psalm 86:8; Isaiah 40:25; Matthew 5:48).
God is omnipotent; He is all-powerful and can do anything that pleases Him, but His actions will always be in accord with the rest of His character (Revelation 19:6; Jeremiah 32:17, 27).
God is just; He is no respecter of persons in the sense of showing favoritism (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 18:30).
God is omnipotent; He is all-powerful and can do anything that pleases Him, but His actions will always be in accord with the rest of His character (Revelation 19:6; Jeremiah 32:17, 27).
God is omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere, but this does not mean that God is everything (Psalm 139:7-13; Jeremiah 23:23).
God is omniscient, meaning He knows the past, present, and future, including what we are thinking at any given moment.
Since He knows everything, His justice will always be administered fairly (Psalm 139:1-5; Proverbs 5:21).
God is one; not only is there no other, but He is alone in being able to meet the deepest needs and longings of our hearts.
God alone is worthy of our worship and devotion (Deuteronomy 6:4).
God is righteous, meaning that God cannot and will not pass over wrongdoing.
It is because of God’s righteousness and justice that, in order for our sins to be forgiven, Jesus had to experience God’s wrath when our sins were placed upon Him (Exodus 9:27; Matthew 27:45-46; Romans 3:21-26).
God is sovereign, meaning He is supreme.
All of His creation put together cannot thwart His purposes (Psalm 93:1; 95:3; Jeremiah 23:20).
God is spirit, meaning He is invisible (John 1:18; 4:24).
He is three in one, the same in substance, equal in power and glory.
Thankfully, this is not the case, for He desires to know each of us personally (Exodus 34:6; Psalm 31:19; 1 Peter 1:3; John 3:16, 17:3).
God is truth, He will remain incorruptible and cannot lie (Psalm 117:2; 1 Samuel 15:29).
God is holy, separated from all moral defilement and hostile toward it.
God is a Trinity.
God is referred to as a consuming fire (Isaiah 6:3; Habakkuk 1:13; Exodus 3:2, 4-5; Hebrews 12:29).
God is gracious, and His grace includes His goodness, kindness, mercy, and love.
If it were not for God’s grace, His holiness would exclude us from His presence.
Thankfully, this is not the case, for He desires to know each of us personally (Exodus 34:6; Psalm 31:19; 1 Peter 1:3; John 3:16, 17:3).
 What are the most important things to understand about the nature of God?
May we all wholeheartedly continue to seek after Him (Jeremiah 29:13).
The third of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Jesus Christ is God’s only provision for our sin.
 The Four Spiritual Laws are a way of sharing the good news of the salvation that is available through faith in Jesus Christ.
It is a simple way of organizing the important information in the Gospel into four points.
John 3:16 tells us, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."
What is preventing us from having an abundant life?
The second of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Humanity is tainted by sin and is therefore separated from God.
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 informs us of what we need to know and believe in order to be saved, "...that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures..." Jesus Himself declares that He is the only way of salvation in John 14:6, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
However, humanity brought sin into the world, and is therefore separated from God.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
What is the solution?
The third of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Jesus Christ is God’s only provision for our sin.
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 informs us of what we need to know and believe in order to be saved, "...that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures..." Jesus Himself declares that He is the only way of salvation in John 14:6, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
How can I receive this wonderful gift of salvation?
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 informs us of what we need to know and believe in order to be saved, "...that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures..." Jesus Himself declares that He is the only way of salvation in John 14:6, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
John 1:12, 13 indicates that being "born again" also carries the idea of "becoming children of God" through trust in the name of Jesus Christ.
The question logically comes, "Why does a person need to be born again?"
The question logically comes, "Why does a person need to be born again?"
 The classic passage from the Bible that answers this question is John 3:1-21.
The Lord Jesus Christ is talking to Nicodemus, a prominent Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin (the ruling body of the Jews).
Nicodemus had come to Jesus at night with some questions.
As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, “‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’ ‘How can a man be born when he is old?’ Nicodemus asked.
As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, “‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’ ‘How can a man be born when he is old?’ Nicodemus asked.
When one is saved, he/she has been born again, spiritually renewed, and is now a child of God by right of new birth.
‘Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be born!’ Jesus answered, ‘I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.
You should not be surprised at my saying, “You must be born again”’” (John 3:3-7).
The phrase "born again" literally means "born from above."
He needed a change of his heart—a spiritual transformation.
New birth, being born again, is an act of God whereby eternal life is imparted to the person who believes (2 Corinthians 5:17; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:3; 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1-4, 18).
John 1:12, 13 indicates that being "born again" also carries the idea of "becoming children of God" through trust in the name of Jesus Christ.
To the Romans he wrote, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
Sinners are spiritually “dead”; when they receive spiritual life through faith in Christ, the Bible likens it to a rebirth.
Only those who are born again have their sins forgiven and have a relationship with God.
How does that come to be?
Ephesians 2:8-9 states, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."
Trusting in Jesus Christ, the One who paid the penalty of sin when He died on the cross, is the means to be "born again."
If you have never trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior, will you consider the prompting of the Holy Spirit as He speaks to your heart?
You need to be born again.
Will you pray the prayer of repentance and become a new creation in Christ today?
"Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God" (John 1:12-13).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and be born again, here is a sample prayer.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness—the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
At the same time, many Christians refuse to submit to the biblical exhortations about making offerings to the Lord.
 Many Christians struggle with the issue of tithing.
In some churches giving is over-emphasized.
At the same time, many Christians refuse to submit to the biblical exhortations about making offerings to the Lord.
Tithing/giving is intended to be a joy and a blessing.
Sadly, that is sometimes not the case in the church today.
Tithing is an Old Testament concept.
The tithe was a requirement of the Law in which the Israelites were to give 10 percent of the crops they grew and the livestock they raised to the tabernacle/temple (Leviticus 27:30; Numbers 18:26; Deuteronomy 14:24; 2 Chronicles 31:5).
In fact, the Old Testament Law required multiple tithes—one for the Levites, one for the use of the temple and the feasts, and one for the poor of the land—which would have pushed the total to around 23.3 percent.
After the death of Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law, the New Testament nowhere commands, or even recommends, that Christians submit to a legalistic tithe system.
The New Testament nowhere designates a percentage of income a person should set aside, but only says gifts should be “in keeping with income” (1 Corinthians 16:2).
Some in the Christian church have taken the 10 percent figure from the Old Testament tithe and applied it as a “recommended minimum” for Christians in their giving.
The New Testament talks about the importance and benefits of giving.
We are to give as we are able.
Sometimes that means giving more than 10 percent; sometimes that may mean giving less.
It all depends on the ability of the Christian and the needs of the body of Christ.
Every Christian should diligently pray and seek God’s wisdom in the matter of participating in tithing and/or how much to give (James 1:5).
Above all, all tithes and offerings should be given with pure motives and an attitude of worship to God and service to the body of Christ.
“Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7).
The men who wrote the Bible could not have seen living dinosaurs.
The men who wrote the Bible could not have seen living dinosaurs.
 The topic of dinosaurs in the Bible is part of a larger ongoing debate within the Christian community over the age of the earth, the proper interpretation of Genesis, and how to interpret the physical evidences we find all around us.
Those who believe in an older age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does not mention dinosaurs, because, according to their paradigm, dinosaurs died out millions of years before the first man ever walked the earth.
The men who wrote the Bible could not have seen living dinosaurs.
Those who believe in a younger age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does mention dinosaurs, though it never actually uses the word “dinosaur.” Instead, it uses the Hebrew word tanniyn, which is translated a few different ways in our English Bibles.
Dinosaurs like the brachiosaurus and the diplodocus, on the other hand, had huge tails which could easily be compared to a cedar tree.
These creatures are mentioned nearly thirty times in the Old Testament and were found both on land and in the water.
In addition to mentioning these giant reptiles, the Bible describes a couple of creatures in such a way that some scholars believe the writers may have been describing dinosaurs.
The behemoth is said to be the mightiest of all God’s creatures, a giant whose tail is likened to a cedar tree (Job 40:15).
Some scholars have tried to identify the behemoth as either an elephant or a hippopotamus.
Others point out that elephants and hippopotamuses have very thin tails, nothing comparable to a cedar tree.
Dinosaurs like the brachiosaurus and the diplodocus, on the other hand, had huge tails which could easily be compared to a cedar tree.
Nearly every ancient civilization has some sort of art depicting giant reptilian creatures.
Petroglyphs, artifacts, and even little clay figurines found in North America resemble modern depictions of dinosaurs.
In addition to the substantial amount of anthropic and historical evidences for the coexistence of dinosaurs and man, there are physical evidences, like the fossilized footprints of humans and dinosaurs found together at places in North America and West-Central Asia.
So, are there dinosaurs in the Bible?
The matter is far from settled.
It depends on how you interpret the available evidences and how you view the world around you.
If the Bible is interpreted literally, a young earth interpretation will result, and the idea that dinosaurs and man coexisted can be accepted.
If dinosaurs and human beings coexisted, what happened to the dinosaurs?
While the Bible does not discuss the issue, dinosaurs likely died out sometime after the flood due to a combination of dramatic environmental shifts and the fact that they were relentlessly hunted to extinction by man.
 First of all, no matter what view one takes on the issue of divorce, it is important to remember Malachi 2:16: “I hate divorce, says the LORD God of Israel.” According to the Bible, marriage is a lifetime commitment.
 First of all, no matter what view one takes on the issue of divorce, it is important to remember Malachi 2:16: “I hate divorce, says the LORD God of Israel.” According to the Bible, marriage is a lifetime commitment.
“So they are no longer two, but one.
Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate” (Matthew 19:6).
God realizes, though, that, since marriages involve two sinful human beings, divorces are going to occur.
In the Old Testament, He laid down some laws in order to protect the rights of divorcées, especially women (Deuteronomy 24:1–4).
Jesus pointed out that these laws were given because of the hardness of people’s hearts, not because such laws were God’s desire (Matthew 19:8).
The controversy over whether divorce and remarriage is allowed according to the Bible revolves primarily around Jesus’ words in Matthew 5:32 and 19:9.
Many interpreters understand this “exception clause” as referring to “marital unfaithfulness” during the “betrothal” period.
In Jewish custom, a man and a woman were considered married even while they were still engaged or “betrothed.” According to this view, immorality during this “betrothal” period would then be the only valid reason for a divorce.
In Jewish custom, a man and a woman were considered married even while they were still engaged or “betrothed.” According to this view, immorality during this “betrothal” period would then be the only valid reason for a divorce.
Some understand 1 Corinthians 7:15 as another “exception,” allowing remarriage if an unbelieving spouse divorces a believer.
However, the context does not mention remarriage but only says a believer is not bound to continue a marriage if an unbelieving spouse wants to leave.
Others claim that abuse (spousal or child) is a valid reason for divorce even though it is not listed as such in the Bible.
While this may very well be the case, it is never wise to presume upon the Word of God.
Sometimes lost in the debate over the exception clause is the fact that, whatever “marital unfaithfulness” means, it is an allowance for divorce, not a requirement for it.
Even when adultery is committed, a couple can, through God’s grace, learn to forgive and begin rebuilding their marriage.
God has forgiven us of so much more.
Surely we can follow His example and even forgive the sin of adultery (Ephesians 4:32).
However, in many instances a spouse is unrepentant and continues in sexual immorality.
That is where Matthew 19:9 can possibly be applied.
However, the context does not mention remarriage but only says a believer is not bound to continue a marriage if an unbelieving spouse wants to leave.
God sometimes calls people to be single so that their attention is not divided (1 Corinthians 7:32–35).
Remarriage after a divorce may be an option in some circumstances, but that does not mean it is the only option.
Although not stated in the text, it would seem the allowance for remarriage after divorce is God’s mercy for the one who was sinned against, not for the one who committed the sexual immorality.
The Bible makes it abundantly clear that God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16) and that reconciliation and forgiveness should mark a believer’s life (Luke 11:4; Ephesians 4:32).
However, the context does not mention remarriage but only says a believer is not bound to continue a marriage if an unbelieving spouse wants to leave.
A divorced and/or remarried believer should not feel any less loved by God, even if the divorce and/or remarriage is not covered under the possible exception clause of Matthew 19:9.
Even when adultery is committed, a couple can, through God’s grace, learn to forgive and begin rebuilding their marriage.
However, Scripture does not necessarily forbid a Christian from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol.
However, Scripture does not necessarily forbid a Christian from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol.
 Scripture has much to say regarding the drinking of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3; Deuteronomy 29:6; Judges 13:4, 7, 14; Proverbs 20:1; 31:4; Isaiah 5:11, 22; 24:9; 28:7; 29:9; 56:12).
However, Scripture does not necessarily forbid a Christian from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol.
In fact, some Scriptures discuss alcohol in positive terms.
Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.” Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from your own vineyard as a sign of God’s blessing.
Isaiah 55:1 encourages, “Yes, come buy wine and milk…”
  What God commands Christians regarding alcohol is to avoid drunkenness (Ephesians 5:18).
The Bible condemns drunkenness and its effects (Proverbs 23:29-35).
Christians are also commanded to not allow their bodies to be “mastered” by anything (1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19).
Drinking alcohol in excess is undeniably addictive.
Scripture also forbids a Christian from doing anything that might offend other Christians or encourage them to sin against their conscience (1 Corinthians 8:9-13).
In light of these principles, it would be extremely difficult for any Christian to say he is drinking alcohol in excess to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31).
Jesus changed water into wine.
It even seems that Jesus drank wine on occasion (John 2:1-11; Matthew 26:29).
In New Testament times, the water was not very clean.
Without modern sanitation, the water was often filled with bacteria, viruses, and all kinds of contaminants.
The same is true in many third-world countries today.
Without modern sanitation, the water was often filled with bacteria, viruses, and all kinds of contaminants.
In 1 Timothy 5:23, Paul instructed Timothy to stop drinking water exclusively (which was probably causing his stomach problems) and instead drink wine.
In that day, wine was fermented (containing alcohol), but not necessarily to the degree it is today.
It is incorrect to say that it was grape juice, but it is also incorrect to say that it was the same thing as the wine commonly used today.
Again, Scripture does not forbid Christians from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol.
Alcohol is not, in and of itself, tainted by sin.
It is drunkenness and addiction to alcohol that a Christian must absolutely refrain from (Ephesians 5:18; 1 Corinthians 6:12).
Alcohol, consumed in small quantities, is neither harmful nor addictive.
In fact, some doctors advocate drinking small amounts of red wine for its health benefits, especially for the heart.
Consumption of small quantities of alcohol is a matter of Christian freedom.
Drunkenness and addiction are sin.
However, due to the biblical concerns regarding alcohol and its effects, due to the easy temptation to consume alcohol in excess, and due to the possibility of causing offense and/or stumbling of others, it is often best for a Christian to abstain from drinking alcohol.
When examining what the Bible says about homosexuality, it is important to distinguish between homosexual behavior and homosexual inclinations or attractions.
The same is true with a susceptibility to homosexuality.
On the other hand, the Bible clearly and consistently declares that homosexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19:1–13; Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:10).
Romans 1:26–27 teaches that homosexuality is a result of denying and disobeying God.
Just because a person is born with a greater susceptibility to fits of rage, that doesn’t make it right for him to give in to those desires and explode at every provocation.
First Corinthians 6:9 proclaims that those who practice homosexuality, and therefore transgress God’s created order, are not saved.
Homosexual behavior is sinful, but the Bible never says it is a sin to be tempted.
On the other hand, the Bible clearly and consistently declares that homosexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19:1–13; Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:10).
A person may be born with a greater susceptibility to homosexuality, just as some people are born with a tendency to violence and other sins.
That does not excuse the person’s choosing to sin by giving in to sinful desires.
Just because a person is born with a greater susceptibility to fits of rage, that doesn’t make it right for him to give in to those desires and explode at every provocation.
                                                                                         Answer
The same is true with a susceptibility to homosexuality.
Finally, the Bible does not describe homosexuality as a “greater” sin than any other.
One of the fruits of rebellion against God is homosexuality.
God promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).
According to the Bible, God’s forgiveness is available to the homosexual just as it is to the adulterer, idol worshiper, murderer, and thief.
God promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).
The Bible undeniably condemns adultery and sexual immorality, but is sex before marriage considered sexually immoral?
 There is no Hebrew or Greek word used in the Bible that precisely refers to sex before marriage.
The Bible undeniably condemns adultery and sexual immorality, but is sex before marriage considered sexually immoral?
According to 1 Corinthians 7:2, “yes” is the clear answer: “But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.” In this verse, Paul states that marriage is the “cure” for sexual immorality.
First Corinthians 7:2 is essentially saying that, because people cannot control themselves and so many are having immoral sex outside of marriage, people should get married.
God wants men and women to enjoy sexual activity within the confines of marriage.
Since 1 Corinthians 7:2 clearly includes sex before marriage in the definition of sexual immorality, all of the Bible verses that condemn sexual immorality as being sinful also condemn sex before marriage as sinful.
Sex before marriage is included in the biblical definition of sexual immorality.
There are numerous Scriptures that declare sex before marriage to be a sin (Acts 15:20; 1 Corinthians 5:1; 6:13, 18; 10:8; 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Jude 7).
The Bible promotes complete abstinence before marriage.
Sex between a husband and his wife is the only form of sexual relations of which God approves (Hebrews 13:4).
Far too often we focus on the “recreation” aspect of sex without recognizing that there is another aspect—procreation.
Sex within marriage is pleasurable, and God designed it that way.
God wants men and women to enjoy sexual activity within the confines of marriage.
Song of Solomon and several other Bible passages (such as Proverbs 5:19) clearly describe the pleasure of sex.
However, the couple must understand that God’s intent for sex includes producing children.
While practicality does not determine right from wrong, if the Bible’s message on sex before marriage were obeyed, there would be far fewer sexually transmitted diseases, far fewer abortions, far fewer unwed mothers and unwanted pregnancies, and far fewer children growing up without both parents in their lives.
While practicality does not determine right from wrong, if the Bible’s message on sex before marriage were obeyed, there would be far fewer sexually transmitted diseases, far fewer abortions, far fewer unwed mothers and unwanted pregnancies, and far fewer children growing up without both parents in their lives.
Abstinence is God’s only policy when it comes to sex before marriage.
Abstinence saves lives, protects babies, gives sexual relations the proper value, and, most importantly, honors God.
The Bible views suicide as equal to murder, which is what it is—self-murder.
The Bible views suicide as equal to murder, which is what it is—self-murder.
 The Bible mentions six specific people who committed suicide: Abimelech (Judges 9:54), Saul (1 Samuel 31:4), Saul’s armor-bearer (1 Samuel 31:4–6), Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17:23), Zimri (1 Kings 16:18), and Judas (Matthew 27:5).
Five of these men were noted for their wickedness (the exception is Saul’s armor-bearer—nothing is said of his character).
Some consider Samson’s death an instance of suicide, because he knew his actions would lead to his death (Judges 16:26–31), but Samson’s goal was to kill Philistines, not himself.
The Bible views suicide as equal to murder, which is what it is—self-murder.
Suicide, the taking of one’s own life, is ungodly because it rejects God’s gift of life.
So, according to the Bible, suicide is a sin.
The painful scars left by a suicide do not heal easily.
Suicide, the taking of one’s own life, is ungodly because it rejects God’s gift of life.
The Bible views suicide as equal to murder, which is what it is—self-murder.
Solomon learned to “fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind” (Ecclesiastes 12:13).
 The Bible mentions six specific people who committed suicide: Abimelech (Judges 9:54), Saul (1 Samuel 31:4), Saul’s armor-bearer (1 Samuel 31:4–6), Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17:23), Zimri (1 Kings 16:18), and Judas (Matthew 27:5).
Paul learned that, although the pressure he faced was beyond his ability to endure, the Lord can bear all things: “This happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead” (2 Corinthians 1:9).
Some consider Samson’s death an instance of suicide, because he knew his actions would lead to his death (Judges 16:26–31), but Samson’s goal was to kill Philistines, not himself.
Suicide, the taking of one’s own life, is ungodly because it rejects God’s gift of life.
So, according to the Bible, suicide is a sin.
The Bible views suicide as equal to murder, which is what it is—self-murder.
Suicide, the taking of one’s own life, is ungodly because it rejects God’s gift of life.

A person who desires a tattoo to garner attention or draw admiration has a vain, sinful focus on self.
The believer’s body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).
The believer’s body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).
The New Testament does not say anything about whether or not a believer in Jesus Christ should get a tattoo.
◦ “Outward adornment” is not as important as the development of the “inner self” and should not be the focus of a Christian (1 Peter 3:3–4).
Because of Scripture’s silence, getting inked falls under the category of a “gray area,” and believers should follow their convictions in the matter, respecting those who may have different convictions.

◦ God sees the heart, and our motivation for anything we do should be to glorify God (1 Corinthians 10:31).
The New Testament does not say anything about whether or not a believer in Jesus Christ should get a tattoo.
For a minor to get a tattoo in violation of his or her parents’ wishes is biblically unsupportable.
◦ Whatever does not come from faith is sin (Romans 14:23), so the person getting the tattoo should be fully convinced that it is God’s will for him or her.
◦ Our bodies, as well as our souls, have been redeemed and belong to God.
◦ Whatever does not come from faith is sin (Romans 14:23), so the person getting the tattoo should be fully convinced that it is God’s will for him or her.
Tattoos are not just for delinquents or rebels anymore.

There are women who believe women should not serve as pastors and that the Bible places restrictions on the ministry of women, and there are men who believe women can serve as pastors and that there are no restrictions on women in ministry.
There are women who believe women should not serve as pastors and that the Bible places restrictions on the ministry of women, and there are men who believe women can serve as pastors and that there are no restrictions on women in ministry.
 There is perhaps no more hotly debated issue in the church today than the issue of women serving as pastors.
As a result, it is very important to not see this issue as men versus women.
There are women who believe women should not serve as pastors and that the Bible places restrictions on the ministry of women, and there are men who believe women can serve as pastors and that there are no restrictions on women in ministry.
It is an issue of biblical interpretation.
The Word of God proclaims, “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent” (1 Timothy 2:11–12).
In the church, God assigns different roles to men and women.
This is a result of the way mankind was created and the way in which sin entered the world (1 Timothy 2:13–14).
God, through the apostle Paul, restricts women from serving in roles of teaching and/or having spiritual authority over men.
This precludes women from serving as pastors over men, which definitely includes preaching to them, teaching them publicly, and exercising spiritual authority over them.
There are many objections to this view of women in pastoral ministry.
A common one is that Paul restricts women from teaching because in the first century, women were typically uneducated.
However, 1 Timothy 2:11–14 nowhere mentions educational status.
If education were a qualification for ministry, then the majority of Jesus’ disciples would not have been qualified.
A second common objection is that Paul only restricted the women of Ephesus from teaching men (1 Timothy was written to Timothy, the pastor of the church in Ephesus).
Ephesus was known for its temple to Artemis, and women were the authorities in that branch of paganism—therefore, the theory goes, Paul was only reacting against the female-led customs of the Ephesian idolaters, and the church needed to be different.
However, the book of 1 Timothy nowhere mentions Artemis, nor does Paul mention the standard practice of Artemis worshipers as a reason for the restrictions in 1 Timothy 2:11–12.
A third objection is that Paul is only referring to husbands and wives, not men and women in general.
The Greek words for “woman” and “man” in 1 Timothy 2 could refer to husbands and wives; however, the basic meaning of the words is broader than that.
Further, the same Greek words are used in verses 8–10.
Are only husbands to lift up holy hands in prayer without anger and disputing (verse 8)?
Are only husbands to lift up holy hands in prayer without anger and disputing (verse 8)?
Of course not.
Verses 8–10 clearly refer to all men and women, not just husbands and wives.
There is nothing in the context that would indicate a narrowing to husbands and wives in verses 11–14.
Yet another objection to this interpretation of women in pastoral ministry is in relation to women who held positions of leadership in the Bible, specifically Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah in the Old Testament.
It is true that these women were chosen by God for special service to Him and that they stand as models of faith, courage, and, yes, leadership.
However, the authority of women in the Old Testament is not relevant to the issue of pastors in the church.
The New Testament Epistles present a new paradigm for God’s people—the church, the body of Christ—and that paradigm involves an authority structure unique to the church, not for the nation of Israel or any other Old Testament entity.
Similar arguments are made using Priscilla and Phoebe in the New Testament.
In Acts 18, Priscilla and Aquila are presented as faithful ministers for Christ.
Priscilla’s name is mentioned first, perhaps indicating that she was more prominent in ministry than her husband.
Did Priscilla and her husband teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to Apollos?
Yes, in their home they “explained to him the way of God more adequately” (Acts 18:26).
Does the Bible ever say that Priscilla pastored a church or taught publicly or became the spiritual leader of a congregation of saints?
No.
As far as we know, Priscilla was not involved in ministry activity in contradiction to 1 Timothy 2:11–14.
In Romans 16:1, Phoebe is called a “deacon” (or “servant”) in the church and is highly commended by Paul.
But, as with Priscilla, there is nothing in Scripture to indicate that Phoebe was a pastor or a teacher of men in the church.
“Able to teach” is given as a qualification for elders, but not for deacons (1 Timothy 3:1–13; Titus 1:6–9).
The structure of 1 Timothy 2:11–14 makes the reason why women cannot be pastors perfectly clear.
Verse 13 begins with “for,” giving the “cause” of Paul’s statement in verses 11–12.
Why should women not teach or have authority over men?
And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived” (verses 13–14).
God created Adam first and then created Eve to be a “helper” for Adam.
The order of creation has universal application in the family (Ephesians 5:22–33) and in the church.
The fact that Eve was deceived is also given in 1 Timothy 2:14 as a reason for women not serving as pastors or having spiritual authority over men.
This does not mean that women are gullible or that they are all more easily deceived than men.
If all women are more easily deceived, why would they be allowed to teach children (who are easily deceived) and other women (who are supposedly more easily deceived)?
The text simply says that women are not to teach men or have spiritual authority over men because Eve was deceived.
God has chosen to give men the primary teaching authority in the church.
Many women excel in gifts of hospitality, mercy, teaching, evangelism, and helping/serving.
Much of the ministry of the local church depends on women.
Women in the church are not restricted from public praying or prophesying (1 Corinthians 11:5), only from having spiritual teaching authority over men.
The Bible nowhere restricts women from exercising the gifts of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12).
Women, just as much as men, are called to minister to others, to demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23), and to proclaim the gospel to the lost (Matthew 28:18–20; Acts 1:8; 1 Peter 3:15).
God has chosen to give men the primary teaching authority in the church.
This is not because men are necessarily better teachers or because women are inferior or less intelligent (which is not the case).
It is simply the way God designed the church to function.
Men are to set the example in spiritual leadership—in their lives and through their words.
Women are to take a less authoritative role.
Women are encouraged to teach other women (Titus 2:3–5).
The Bible also does not restrict women from teaching children.
The only activity women are restricted from is teaching or having spiritual authority over men.
This precludes women from serving as pastors to men.
This does not make women less important, by any means, but rather gives them a ministry focus more in agreement with God’s plan and His gifting of them.
The following is what God’s Word says about the Trinity:
 The most difficult thing about the Christian concept of the Trinity is that there is no way to perfectly and completely understand it.
The Trinity is a concept that is impossible for any human being to fully understand, let alone explain.
God is infinitely greater than we are; therefore, we should not expect to be able to fully understand Him.
The Bible teaches that the Father is God, that Jesus is God, and that the Holy Spirit is God.
The Bible also teaches that there is only one God.
Though we can understand some facts about the relationship of the different Persons of the Trinity to one another, ultimately, it is incomprehensible to the human mind.
However, this does not mean the Trinity is not true or that it is not based on the teachings of the Bible.
The Trinity is one God existing in three Persons.
Understand that this is not in any way suggesting three Gods.
Keep in mind when studying this subject that the word “Trinity” is not found in Scripture.
The Bible teaches that the Father is God, that Jesus is God, and that the Holy Spirit is God.
However, this does not mean the Trinity is not true or that it is not based on the teachings of the Bible.
The following is what God’s Word says about the Trinity:
 1) There is one God (Deuteronomy 6:4; 1 Corinthians 8:4; Galatians 3:20; 1 Timothy 2:5).
2) The Trinity consists of three Persons (Genesis 1:1, 26; 3:22; 11:7; Isaiah 6:8, 48:16, 61:1; Matthew 3:16-17, 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14).
In Genesis 1:1, the Hebrew plural noun "Elohim" is used.
In Genesis 1:26, 3:22, 11:7 and Isaiah 6:8, the plural pronoun for “us” is used.
The word "Elohim" and the pronoun “us” are plural forms, definitely referring in the Hebrew language to more than two.
While this is not an explicit argument for the Trinity, it does denote the aspect of plurality in God.
The Hebrew word for "God," "Elohim," definitely allows for the Trinity.
In Isaiah 48:16 and 61:1, the Son is speaking while making reference to the Father and the Holy Spirit.
Compare Isaiah 61:1 to Luke 4:14-19 to see that it is the Son speaking.
Matthew 3:16-17 describes the event of Jesus’ baptism.
Seen in this passage is God the Holy Spirit descending on God the Son while God the Father proclaims His pleasure in the Son.
Matthew 28:19 and 2 Corinthians 13:14 are examples of three distinct Persons in the Trinity.
4) Each member of the Trinity is God.
The Son is God (John 1:1, 14; Romans 9:5; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:8; 1 John 5:20).
The LORD has a Son (Psalm 2:7, 12; Proverbs 30:2-4).
The Spirit is distinguished from the “LORD” (Numbers 27:18) and from “God” (Psalm 51:10-12).
God the Son is distinguished from God the Father (Psalm 45:6-7; Hebrews 1:8-9).
In the New Testament, Jesus speaks to the Father about sending a Helper, the Holy Spirit (John 14:16-17).
This shows that Jesus did not consider Himself to be the Father or the Holy Spirit.
Consider also all the other times in the Gospels where Jesus speaks to the Father.
Was He speaking to Himself?
No.
He spoke to another Person in the Trinity—the Father.
4) Each member of the Trinity is God.
The Father is God (John 6:27; Romans 1:7; 1 Peter 1:2).
The Son is God (John 1:1, 14; Romans 9:5; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:8; 1 John 5:20).
The Holy Spirit is God (Acts 5:3-4; 1 Corinthians 3:16).
Scripture shows that the Holy Spirit is subordinate to the Father and the Son, and the Son is subordinate to the Father.
Scripture shows that the Holy Spirit is subordinate to the Father and the Son, and the Son is subordinate to the Father.
Scripture shows that the Holy Spirit is subordinate to the Father and the Son, and the Son is subordinate to the Father.
This is simply an area which our finite minds cannot understand concerning the infinite God.
Concerning the Son see Luke 22:42, John 5:36, John 20:21, and 1 John 4:14.
Concerning the Holy Spirit see John 14:16, 14:26, 15:26, 16:7, and especially John 16:13-14.
The Father does all these things through the Son, who functions as His agent.
The Father is the ultimate source or cause of the universe (1 Corinthians 8:6; Revelation 4:11); divine revelation (Revelation 1:1); salvation (John 3:16-17); and Jesus’ human works (John 5:17; 14:10).
The Father does all these things through the Son, who functions as His agent.
The Son is the agent through whom the Father does the following works: the creation and maintenance of the universe (1 Corinthians 8:6; John 1:3; Colossians 1:16-17); divine revelation (John 1:1, 16:12-15; Matthew 11:27; Revelation 1:1); and salvation (2 Corinthians 5:19; Matthew 1:21; John 4:42).
Thus, the Father does all these things by the power of the Holy Spirit.
The doctrine of the Trinity has been a divisive issue throughout the entire history of the Christian church.
While the core aspects of the Trinity are clearly presented in God’s Word, some of the side issues are not as explicitly clear.
The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God—but there is only one God.
That is the biblical doctrine of the Trinity.
Beyond that, the issues are, to a certain extent, debatable and non-essential.
Rather than attempting to fully define the Trinity with our finite human minds, we would be better served by focusing on the fact of God’s greatness and His infinitely higher nature.

“Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
Who has known the mind of the Lord?
Or who has been his counselor?” (Romans 11:33-34).
So, what exactly does the Bible say happens after death?
 Within the Christian faith, there is a significant amount of confusion regarding what happens after death.
Some hold that after death, everyone “sleeps” until the final judgment, after which everyone will be sent to heaven or hell.
Others believe that at the moment of death, people are instantly judged and sent to their eternal destinations.
Still others claim that when people die, their souls/spirits are sent to a “temporary” heaven or hell, to await the final resurrection, the final judgment, and then the finality of their eternal destination.
So, what exactly does the Bible say happens after death?
First, for the believer in Jesus Christ, the Bible tells us that after death believers’ souls/spirits are taken to heaven, because their sins are forgiven by having received Christ as Savior (John 3:16, 18, 36).
For believers, death is to be “away from the body and at home with the Lord” (2 Corinthians 5:6-8; Philippians 1:23).
However, passages such as 1 Corinthians 15:50-54 and 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 describe believers being resurrected and given glorified bodies.
If believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, what is the purpose of this resurrection?
It seems that while the souls/spirits of believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, the physical body remains in the grave “sleeping.” At the resurrection of believers, the physical body is resurrected, glorified, and then reunited with the soul/spirit.
This reunited and glorified body-soul-spirit will be the possession of believers for eternity in the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21-22).
Second, for those who do not receive Jesus Christ as Savior, death means everlasting punishment.
However, similar to the destiny of believers, unbelievers also seem to be sent immediately to a temporary holding place, to await their final resurrection, judgment, and eternal destiny.
Luke 16:22-23 describes a rich man being tormented immediately after death.
Revelation 20:11-15 describes all the unbelieving dead being resurrected, judged at the great white throne, and then being cast into the lake of fire.
However, similar to the destiny of believers, unbelievers also seem to be sent immediately to a temporary holding place, to await their final resurrection, judgment, and eternal destiny.
However, similar to the destiny of believers, unbelievers also seem to be sent immediately to a temporary holding place, to await their final resurrection, judgment, and eternal destiny.
The rich man cried out, “I am in agony in this fire” (Luke 16:24).
Therefore, after death, a person resides in a “temporary” heaven or hell.
After this temporary realm, at the final resurrection, a person’s eternal destiny will not change.
The precise “location” of that eternal destiny is what changes.
Believers will ultimately be granted entrance into the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21:1).
Unbelievers will ultimately be sent to the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11-15).
These are the final, eternal destinations of all people—based entirely on whether or not they had trusted Jesus Christ alone for salvation (Matthew 25:46; John 3:36).
The word “Christian” literally means, “belonging to the party of Christ” or a “follower of Christ.”
 A dictionary definition of a Christian would be something similar to “a person professing belief in Jesus as the Christ or in the religion based on the teachings of Jesus.” While this is a good starting point, like many dictionary definitions, it falls somewhat short of really communicating the biblical truth of what it means to be a Christian.
The word “Christian” is used three times in the New Testament (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Peter 4:16).
Followers of Jesus Christ were first called “Christians” in Antioch (Acts 11:26) because their behavior, activity, and speech were like Christ.
The word “Christian” literally means, “belonging to the party of Christ” or a “follower of Christ.”
  Unfortunately over time, the word “Christian” has lost a great deal of its significance and is often used of someone who is religious or has high moral values but who may or may not be a true follower of Jesus Christ.
Many people who do not believe and trust in Jesus Christ consider themselves Christians simply because they go to church or they live in a “Christian” nation.
But going to church, serving those less fortunate than you, or being a good person does not make you a Christian.
The Bible teaches that the good works we do cannot make us acceptable to God.
Titus 3:5 says, “He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.
He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.” So, a Christian is someone who has been born again by God (John 3:3; John 3:7; 1 Peter 1:23) and has put faith and trust in Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 2:8 tells us that it is “…by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.” 
 A true Christian is a person who has put faith and trust in the person and work of Jesus Christ, including His death on the cross as payment for sins and His resurrection on the third day.
John 1:12 tells us, “Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” The mark of a true Christian is love for others and obedience to God’s Word (1 John 2:4, 10).
A true Christian is indeed a child of God, a part of God’s true family, and one who has been given new life in Jesus Christ.
Beyond these core beliefs, there are many other items that are, or at least should be, indicative of what Christianity is and what Christians believe.
Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired, “God-breathed” Word of God and that its teaching is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired, “God-breathed” Word of God and that its teaching is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired, “God-breathed” Word of God and that its teaching is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
Christians believe in one God that exists in three persons—the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.
Christians believe that mankind was created specifically to have a relationship with God, but sin separates all men from God (Romans 3:23; 5:12).
Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ walked this earth, fully God, and yet fully man (Philippians 2:6-11), and died on the cross.
Christians believe that after His death, Christ was buried, He rose again, and now lives at the right hand of the Father, making intercession for the believers forever (Hebrews 7:25).
Christianity proclaims that Jesus’ death on the cross was sufficient to completely pay the sin debt owed by all men and this is what restores the broken relationship between God and man (Hebrews 9:11-14; 10:10; Romans 5:8; 6:23).
Christianity teaches that in order to be saved and be granted entrance into heaven after death, one must place one’s faith entirely in the finished work of Christ on the cross.
If we believe that Christ died in our place and paid the price of our own sins, and rose again, then we are saved.
There is nothing that anyone can do to earn salvation.
We cannot be “good enough” to please God on our own, because we are all sinners (Isaiah 53:6; 64:6-7).
There is nothing more to be done, because Christ has done all the work!
When He was on the cross, Jesus said, “It is finished” (John 19:30), meaning that the work of redemption was completed.
Christianity teaches that in order to be saved and be granted entrance into heaven after death, one must place one’s faith entirely in the finished work of Christ on the cross.
According to Christianity, salvation is freedom from the old sin nature and freedom to pursue a right relationship with God.
Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ walked this earth, fully God, and yet fully man (Philippians 2:6-11), and died on the cross.
Christians believe that after His death, Christ was buried, He rose again, and now lives at the right hand of the Father, making intercession for the believers forever (Hebrews 7:25).
Christianity teaches that in order to be saved and be granted entrance into heaven after death, one must place one’s faith entirely in the finished work of Christ on the cross.
According to Christianity, salvation is freedom from the old sin nature and freedom to pursue a right relationship with God.
Where we were once slaves to sin, we are now slaves to Christ (Romans 6:15-22).
As long as believers live on this earth in their sinful bodies, they will engage in a constant struggle with sin.
However, Christians can have victory in the struggle with sin by studying and applying God’s Word in their lives and being controlled by the Holy Spirit—that is, submitting to the Spirit’s leading in everyday circumstances.
So, while many religious systems require that a person do or not do certain things, Christianity is about believing that Christ died on the cross as payment for our own sins and rose again.
Our sin debt is paid and we can have fellowship with God.
We can have victory over our sin nature and walk in fellowship and obedience with God.
That is true biblical Christianity.
Christian baptism has a deeper significance.
 Christian baptism is one of two ordinances that Jesus instituted for the church.
Just before His ascension, Jesus said, “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
These instructions specify that the church is responsible to teach Jesus’ word, make disciples, and baptize those disciples.
These things are to be done everywhere (“all nations”) until “the very end of the age.” So, if for no other reason, baptism has importance because Jesus commanded it.
Baptism was practiced before the founding of the church.
The Jews of ancient times would baptize proselytes to signify the converts’ “cleansed” nature.
John the Baptist used baptism to prepare the way of the Lord, requiring everyone, not just Gentiles, to be baptized because everyone needs repentance.
However, John’s baptism, signifying repentance, is not the same as Christian baptism, as seen in Acts 18:24–26 and 19:1–7.
Christian baptism has a deeper significance.
Baptism is to be done in the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit—this is what makes it “Christian” baptism.
When we are saved, we are “baptized” by the Spirit into the Body of Christ, which is the church.
First Corinthians 12:13 says, “We were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.” Baptism by water is a “reenactment” of the baptism by the Spirit.
Christian baptism is the means by which a person makes a public profession of faith and discipleship.
In the waters of baptism, a person says, wordlessly, “I confess faith in Christ; Jesus has cleansed my soul from sin, and I now have a new life of sanctification.”
 Christian baptism illustrates, in dramatic style, the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ.
At the same time, it also illustrates our death to sin and new life in Christ.
As the sinner confesses the Lord Jesus, he dies to sin (Romans 6:11) and is raised to a brand-new life (Colossians 2:12).
Being submerged in the water represents death to sin, and emerging from the water represents the cleansed, holy life that follows salvation.
Romans 6:4 puts it this way: “We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”
 Very simply, baptism is an outward testimony of the inward change in a believer’s life.
Christian baptism is an act of obedience to the Lord after salvation; although baptism is closely associated with salvation, it is not a requirement to be saved.
The Bible shows in many places that the order of events is 1) a person believes in the Lord Jesus and 2) he is baptized.
This sequence is seen in Acts 2:41, “Those who accepted [Peter’s] message were baptized” (see also Acts 16:14–15).
A new believer in Jesus Christ should desire to be baptized as soon as possible.
In Acts 8 Philip speaks “the good news about Jesus” to the Ethiopian eunuch, and, “as they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, ‘Look, here is water.
What can stand in the way of my being baptized?’” (verses 35–36).
Right away, they stopped the chariot, and Philip baptized the man.
Baptism illustrates a believer’s identification with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection.
Everywhere the gospel is preached and people are drawn to faith in Christ, they are to be baptized.
How can purpose, fulfillment, and satisfaction in life be found?
 What is the meaning of life?
How can purpose, fulfillment, and satisfaction in life be found?
How can something of lasting significance be achieved?
Many people have never stopped to consider these important questions.
They look back years later and wonder why their relationships have fallen apart and why they feel so empty, even though they may have achieved what they set out to accomplish.
An athlete who had reached the pinnacle of his sport was once asked what he wished someone would have told him when he first started playing his sport.
He replied, “I wish that someone would have told me that when you reach the top, there’s nothing there.” Many goals reveal their emptiness only after years have been wasted in their pursuit.
People have testified that, while they achieved their goals of wealth, relationships, and pleasure, there was still a deep void inside, a feeling of emptiness that nothing seemed to fill.
Some of these pursuits include business success, wealth, good relationships, sex, entertainment, and doing good to others.
People have testified that, while they achieved their goals of wealth, relationships, and pleasure, there was still a deep void inside, a feeling of emptiness that nothing seemed to fill.
Everything is meaningless” (Ecclesiastes 1:2).
King Solomon, the writer of Ecclesiastes, had wealth beyond measure, wisdom beyond any man of his time or ours, hundreds of women, palaces and gardens that were the envy of kingdoms, the best food and wine, and every form of entertainment available.
An athlete who had reached the pinnacle of his sport was once asked what he wished someone would have told him when he first started playing his sport.
And yet he summed up life “under the sun”—life lived as though all there is to life is what we can see with our eyes and experience with our senses—is meaningless.
What explains this void?
God created us for something beyond what we can experience in the here-and-now.
In the book of Genesis, we find a clue to the meaning of life in the fact that God created mankind in His image (Genesis 1:26).
In our hearts we are aware that the “here-and-now” is not all that there is.
In the book of Genesis, we find a clue to the meaning of life in the fact that God created mankind in His image (Genesis 1:26).
This means that we are more like God than we are like anything else.
We also find that, before mankind fell and the curse of sin came upon the earth, the following things were true: 1) God made man a social creature (Genesis 2:18–25); 2) God gave man work (Genesis 2:15); 3) God had fellowship with man (Genesis 3:8); and 4) God gave man dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26).
What explains this void?
God intended mankind to have fulfillment in life, but our condition (especially touching our fellowship with God) was adversely affected by the fall into sin and the resulting curse upon the earth (Genesis 3).
In the book of Genesis, we find a clue to the meaning of life in the fact that God created mankind in His image (Genesis 1:26).
At that time, He will restore full fellowship with redeemed mankind, while the unredeemed will have been judged unworthy and cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11–15).
The curse of sin will be done away with; there will be no more sin, sorrow, sickness, death, or pain (Revelation 21:4).
God will dwell with mankind, and they shall be His children (Revelation 21:7).
Thus, we come full circle: God created us to have fellowship with Him; man sinned, breaking that fellowship; God restores that fellowship fully in the eternal state.
To go through life achieving everything we set out to achieve only to die separated from God for eternity would be worse than futile!
But God has made a way to not only make eternal bliss possible (Luke 23:43) but also life on earth satisfying and meaningful.
How is this eternal bliss and “heaven on earth” obtained?
The meaning of life restored through Jesus Christ
 The real meaning of life, both now and in eternity, is found in the restoration of our relationship with God.
This restoration is only possible through God’s Son, Jesus Christ, who reconciles us to God (Romans 5:10; Acts 4:12; John 1:12; 14:6).
Once that salvation is received by grace through faith, Christ makes us new creations, and we begin the progressive journey of growing closer to Him and learning to rely on Him.
Salvation and eternal life are gained when we trust in Jesus Christ as Savior.
Once that salvation is received by grace through faith, Christ makes us new creations, and we begin the progressive journey of growing closer to Him and learning to rely on Him.
God intended mankind to have fulfillment in life, but our condition (especially touching our fellowship with God) was adversely affected by the fall into sin and the resulting curse upon the earth (Genesis 3).
Thus, we come full circle: God created us to have fellowship with Him; man sinned, breaking that fellowship; God restores that fellowship fully in the eternal state.
Once that salvation is received by grace through faith, Christ makes us new creations, and we begin the progressive journey of growing closer to Him and learning to rely on Him.
This restoration is only possible through God’s Son, Jesus Christ, who reconciles us to God (Romans 5:10; Acts 4:12; John 1:12; 14:6).
Jesus said, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
Thus, we come full circle: God created us to have fellowship with Him; man sinned, breaking that fellowship; God restores that fellowship fully in the eternal state.

This restoration is only possible through God’s Son, Jesus Christ, who reconciles us to God (Romans 5:10; Acts 4:12; John 1:12; 14:6).
A “full” life is logically one that is meaningful and devoid of aimless wandering.

A “full” life is logically one that is meaningful and devoid of aimless wandering.
So how about a religion that is just right for you?
 Fast food restaurants entice us by allowing us to order our food exactly the way we want it.
Some coffee shops boast over a hundred different flavors and varieties of coffee.
Even when buying houses and cars, we can look for one with all the options and features we desire.
We no longer live in just a chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry world.
Choice is king!
You can find about anything you want according to your own personal likes and needs.
So how about a religion that is just right for you?
How about a religion that is guilt-free, makes no demands, and is not encumbered with a lot of bothersome do’s and don’ts?
                                                                                         Answer
But is religion something to be chosen like a favorite flavor of ice cream?
There are a lot of voices vying for our attention, so why should anyone consider Jesus above, say, Muhammad or Confucius, Buddha, or Charles Taze Russell, or Joseph Smith?
After all, don’t all roads lead to Heaven?
Aren’t all religions basically the same?
The truth is that all religions do not lead to Heaven, just as all roads do not lead to Indiana.
Jesus alone speaks with the authority of God because Jesus alone conquered death.
Muhammad, Confucius, and the others molder in their graves to this very day.
But Jesus, by His own power, walked away from the tomb three days after dying on a cruel Roman cross.
Anyone with power over death deserves our attention.
The evidence supporting the resurrection of Jesus is overwhelming.
First, there were over five hundred eye witnesses of the risen Christ!
That is a lot of eye witnesses.
Five hundred voices cannot be ignored.
There is also the matter of the empty tomb.
The enemies of Jesus could have easily stopped all talk of the resurrection by producing His dead, decaying body, but there was no dead body for them to produce!
The tomb was empty!
Could the disciples have stolen His body?
Hardly.
To prevent such a contingency, the tomb of Jesus had been heavily guarded by armed soldiers.
Considering His closest followers had fled in fear at His arrest and crucifixion, it is most unlikely this ragtag band of frightened fishermen would have gone head to head against trained, professional soldiers.
Considering His closest followers had fled in fear at His arrest and crucifixion, it is most unlikely this ragtag band of frightened fishermen would have gone head to head against trained, professional soldiers.
The simple fact is that the resurrection of Jesus cannot be explained away!
Again, anyone who has power over death deserves to be heard.
Jesus proved His power over death; therefore, we need to hear what He says.
Jesus claims to be the only way to salvation (John 14:6).
The simple fact is that the resurrection of Jesus cannot be explained away!
And this same Jesus says, "Come to me all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).
This is a tough world and life is difficult.
Most of us are pretty well bloodied, bruised, and battle-scarred.
Agree?
So what do you want?
Restoration or mere religion?
A living Savior or one of many dead "prophets"?
A meaningful relationship or empty rituals?
Jesus is not a choice—He is the choice!
Jesus is the right "religion" if you are looking for forgiveness (Acts 10:43).
Jesus is the right "religion" if you are looking for a meaningful relationship with God (John 10:10).
Jesus is the right "religion" if you are looking for an eternal home in Heaven (John 3:16).
Place your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior; you will not regret it!
Trust in Him for the forgiveness of your sins; you will not be disappointed.
If you want to have a "right relationship" with God, here is a sample prayer.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
 The Romans Road to salvation is a way of explaining the good news of salvation using verses from the Book of Romans.
 The Romans Road to salvation is a way of explaining the good news of salvation using verses from the Book of Romans.
It is a simple yet powerful method of explaining why we need salvation, how God provided salvation, how we can receive salvation, and what are the results of salvation.
The first verse on the Romans Road to salvation is Romans 3:23, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
The punishment that we have earned for our sins is death.
There is no one who is innocent.
Romans 3:10-18 gives a detailed picture of what sin looks like in our lives.
The second Scripture on the Romans Road to salvation, Romans 6:23, teaches us about the consequences of sin - "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Not just physical death, but eternal death!
The third verse on the Romans Road to salvation picks up where Romans 6:23 left off, "but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Jesus’ death paid for the price of our sins.
Jesus’ resurrection proves that God accepted Jesus’ death as the payment for our sins.
The fourth stop on the Romans Road to salvation is Romans 10:9, "that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."
The second Scripture on the Romans Road to salvation, Romans 6:23, teaches us about the consequences of sin - "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Salvation, the forgiveness of sins, is available to anyone who will trust in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
The final aspect of the Romans Road to salvation is the results of salvation.
Romans 5:1 has this wonderful message, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
Romans 8:1 teaches us, "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
Jesus’ resurrection proves that God accepted Jesus’ death as the payment for our sins.
Finally, we have this precious promise of God from Romans 8:38-39, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Would you like to follow the Romans Road to salvation?
If so, here is a simple prayer you can pray to God.
Saying this prayer is a way to declare to God that you are relying on Jesus Christ for your salvation.
Only faith in Jesus Christ can provide salvation!
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
With your help, I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
                                                                                         Answer
 The sinner’s prayer is a prayer a person prays to God when they understand that they are a sinner and in need of a Savior.
Saying a sinner’s prayer will not accomplish anything on its own.
A true sinner’s prayer only represents what a person knows, understands, and believes about their sinfulness and need for salvation.
The first aspect of a sinner’s prayer is understanding that we are all sinners.
Romans 3:10 proclaims, "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one."
The Bible makes it clear that we have all sinned.
We are all sinners in need of mercy and forgiveness from God (Titus 3:5-7).
Because of our sin, we deserve eternal punishment (Matthew 25:46).
The sinner’s prayer is a plea for grace instead of judgment.
It is a request for mercy instead of wrath.
The second aspect of a sinner’s prayer is knowing what God has done to remedy our lost and sinful condition.
God took on flesh and became a human being in the Person of Jesus Christ (John 1:1,14).
Jesus taught us the truth about God and lived a perfectly righteous and sinless life (John 8:46; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus then died on the cross in our place, taking the punishment that we deserve (Romans 5:8).
Jesus rose from the dead to prove His victory over sin, death, and hell (Colossians 2:15; 1 Corinthians chapter 15).
Because of all of this, we can have our sins forgiven and be promised an eternal home in Heaven - if we will just place our faith in Jesus Christ.
All we have to do is believe that He died in our place and rose from the dead (Romans 10:9-10).
We can be saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone.
Ephesians 2:8 declares, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God."

 Questions about Salvation
If so, Jesus is the way!
 Are you hungry?
Not physically hungry, but do you have a hunger for something more in life?
Is there something deep inside of you that never seems to be satisfied?
If so, Jesus is the way!
Jesus said, “I am the bread of life.
Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” (John 8:12).
Are you confused?
Can you never seem to find a path or purpose in life?
Does it seem like someone has turned out the lights and you cannot find the switch?
If so, Jesus is the way of salvation!
Jesus proclaimed, “I am the light of the world.
Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” (John 8:12).
Do you ever feel like you are locked out of life?
Have you tried so many doors, only to find that what is behind them is empty and meaningless?
Are you looking for an entrance into a fulfilling life?
If so, Jesus is the way of salvation!
Jesus declared, “I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.
He will come in and go out, and find pasture” (John 10:9).
Do other people always let you down?
Have your relationships been shallow and empty?
Does it seem like everyone is trying to take advantage of you?
If so, Jesus is the way!
Jesus said, “I am the good shepherd.
The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me” (John 10:11, 14).
Do you wonder what happens after this life?
Are you tired of living your life for things that only rot or rust?
Do you sometimes doubt whether life has any meaning?
Do you want to live after you die?
If so, Jesus is the way of salvation!
Jesus declared, “I am the resurrection and the life.
He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die” (John 11:25–26).
What is the way?
What is the truth?
What is the life?
Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
The hunger that you feel is a spiritual hunger, and can only be filled by Jesus.
Jesus is the only one who can lift the darkness.
Jesus is the door to a satisfying and eternal life.
Jesus is the friend and shepherd that you have been looking for.
Jesus is the life—in this world and the next.
Jesus is the way of salvation!
The reason you feel hungry, the reason you seem to be lost in darkness, the reason you cannot find meaning in life, is that you are separated from God.
The Bible tells us that we have all sinned and are therefore separated from God (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23).
The void you feel in your heart is God missing from your life.
Jesus is the door to a satisfying and eternal life.
Because of your sin, you are separated from that relationship.
The Bible tells us that we have all sinned and are therefore separated from God (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23).
How can this problem be solved?
Jesus is the way of salvation!
Jesus took your sin upon Himself (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus died in your place (Romans 5:8), taking the punishment that you deserve.
Three days later, Jesus rose from the dead, proving His victory over sin and death (Romans 6:4–5).
Why did He do it?
Jesus answered that question Himself: “Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13).
Jesus died so that you could live.
If you place your faith in Jesus, trusting His death as the payment for your sins, all of your sins are forgiven and washed away.
You will then have your spiritual hunger satisfied.
The lights will be turned on.
You will have access to a fulfilling life.
You will know your true best friend and good shepherd.
You will know that you have life after you die—a resurrected life in heaven for eternity with Jesus!
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
 Unlike the question “Does God exist?” the question of whether Jesus Christ existed is asked by relatively few people.
 Unlike the question “Does God exist?” the question of whether Jesus Christ existed is asked by relatively few people.
Most accept that Jesus was truly a man who lived in Israel 2,000 years ago.
The debate begins with the discussion of Jesus’ full identity.
Almost every major religion teaches that Jesus was a prophet or a good teacher or a godly man.
But the Bible tells us that Jesus was infinitely more than a prophet, a good teacher, or a godly man.
C.
S. Lewis in his book Mere Christianity writes the following: “I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him [Jesus Christ]: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God.’ That is the one thing we must not say.
A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.
You must make your choice.
Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse.
You can shut him up for fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God.
But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.
He has not left that option open to us.
He has not left that option open to us.
So, who did Jesus claim to be?
Who does the Bible say He is?
Jesus said in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” At first glance, this might not seem to be a claim to be God.
They tried to stone Him “for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God” (John 10:33).
The Jews rejected Jesus’ identity as God Incarnate, but they understood exactly what He was saying.
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
In John 8:58 Jesus claims pre-existence, an attribute of God: “‘I tell you the truth,’ Jesus answered, ‘before Abraham was born, I am!’” In response to this statement, the Jews again took up stones to stone Jesus (John 8:59).
In claiming pre-existence, Jesus applied a name for God to Himself—I AM (see Exodus 3:14).
The Jews rejected Jesus’ identity as God Incarnate, but they understood exactly what He was saying.
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
The apostle Paul describes Jesus as “our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).
In the following verses, Jesus never corrects the Jews or attempts to clarify His statement.
The apostle Paul describes Jesus as “our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).
The apostle Peter says the same, calling Jesus “our God and Savior” (2 Peter 1:1).
God the Father bears witness of Jesus’ identity as well: “But about the Son he says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom’” (Hebrews 1:8; cf.
The apostle Paul describes Jesus as “our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).
Several reasons:
 • As C. S. Lewis pointed out, if Jesus is not God, then Jesus is the worst of liars and untrustworthy in every way.
The Jews rejected Jesus’ identity as God Incarnate, but they understood exactly what He was saying.
 • As C. S. Lewis pointed out, if Jesus is not God, then Jesus is the worst of liars and untrustworthy in every way.

Why is the question of Jesus’ identity so important?
Why does it matter whether Jesus is God?
• If Jesus is not God, His death would have been insufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2).
Only God Himself could provide an infinite, eternally valuable sacrifice (Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
As God, Jesus could satisfy God’s wrath.
As a man, Jesus had the capability of dying.
Salvation is available only through faith in Jesus Christ.
As God, Jesus could satisfy God’s wrath.
As He proclaimed, “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
What does the Bible say about the identity of the Holy Spirit?
 There are many misconceptions about the identity of the Holy Spirit.
Some view the Holy Spirit as a mystical force.
Others understand the Holy Spirit as the impersonal power that God makes available to followers of Christ.
What does the Bible say about the identity of the Holy Spirit?
Simply put, the Bible declares that the Holy Spirit is God.
The Bible also tells us that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, a being with a mind, emotions, and a will.
The fact that the Holy Spirit is God is clearly seen in many Scriptures, including Acts 5:3-4.
In this verse Peter confronts Ananias as to why he lied to the Holy Spirit and tells him that he had “not lied to men but to God.” It is a clear declaration that lying to the Holy Spirit is lying to God.
 We can know that the Holy Spirit is indeed a divine person because He possesses a mind, emotions, and a will.
For example, His omnipresence is seen in Psalm 139:7-8, “Where can I go from your Spirit?
Where can I flee from your presence?
If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.” Then in 1 Corinthians 2:10-11, we see the characteristic of omniscience in the Holy Spirit.
For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man’s spirit within him?
In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.”
 We can know that the Holy Spirit is indeed a divine person because He possesses a mind, emotions, and a will.
The Holy Spirit thinks and knows (1 Corinthians 2:10).
The Holy Spirit can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30).
The Spirit intercedes for us (Romans 8:26-27).
 We can know that the Holy Spirit is indeed a divine person because He possesses a mind, emotions, and a will.
He makes decisions according to His will (1 Corinthians 12:7-11).
The Holy Spirit is God, the third Person of the Trinity.
As God, the Holy Spirit can truly function as the Comforter and Counselor that Jesus promised He would be (John 14:16, 26, 15:26).
 The Bible does not specifically say who Cain’s wife was.
 The Bible does not specifically say who Cain’s wife was.
 The Bible does not specifically say who Cain’s wife was.
The only possible answer is that Cain’s wife was his sister or niece or great-niece, etc.
The Bible does not say how old Cain was when he killed Abel (Genesis 4:8).
Since they were both farmers, they were likely both full-grown adults, possibly with families of their own.
Adam and Eve surely had given birth to more children than just Cain and Abel at the time Abel was killed.
They definitely had many more children later (Genesis 5:4).
Cain’s wife (Genesis 4:17) was a daughter or granddaughter of Adam and Eve.
Cain’s wife (Genesis 4:17) was a daughter or granddaughter of Adam and Eve.
Since Adam and Eve were the first (and only) human beings, their children would have no other choice than to intermarry.
God did not forbid inter-family marriage until much later when there were enough people to make intermarriage unnecessary (Leviticus 18:6-18).
The reason that incest today often results in genetic abnormalities is that when two people of similar genetics (i.e., a brother and sister) have children together, there is a high risk of their recessive characteristics becoming dominant.
When people from different families have children, it is highly unlikely that both parents will carry the same recessive traits.
The reason that incest today often results in genetic abnormalities is that when two people of similar genetics (i.e., a brother and sister) have children together, there is a high risk of their recessive characteristics becoming dominant.
Adam and Eve did not have any genetic defects, and that enabled them and the first few generations of their descendants to have a far greater quality of health than we do now.
Adam and Eve did not have any genetic defects, and that enabled them and the first few generations of their descendants to have a far greater quality of health than we do now.
Adam and Eve’s children had few, if any, genetic defects.
As a result, it was safe for them to intermarry.
                                                                                         Answer
 Our hearts go out to those who have thoughts of ending their own lives through suicide.
If that is you right now, it may speak of many emotions, such as feelings of hopelessness and despair.
You may feel like you are in the deepest pit, and you doubt there is any hope of things getting better.
No one seems to care or understand where you are coming from.
Life just is not worth living...or is it?
If you will take a few moments to consider letting God truly be God in your life right now, He will prove how big He really is, “for nothing is impossible with God” (Luke 1:37).
Perhaps scars from past hurts have resulted in an overwhelming sense of rejection or abandonment.
That may lead to self-pity, anger, bitterness, vengeful thoughts, or unhealthy fears that have caused problems in some of your most important relationships.
Why should you not commit suicide?
Friend, no matter how bad things are in your life, there is a God of love who is waiting for you to let Him guide you through your tunnel of despair and out into His marvelous light.
Friend, no matter how bad things are in your life, there is a God of love who is waiting for you to let Him guide you through your tunnel of despair and out into His marvelous light.
He is your sure hope.
His name is Jesus.
This Jesus, the sinless Son of God, identifies with you in your time of rejection and humiliation.
The prophet Isaiah wrote of Him in Isaiah 53:2-6, describing Him as a man who was “despised and rejected” by everyone.
His life was full of sorrow and suffering.
But the sorrows He bore were not His own; they were ours.
Whatever weight of guilt you carry, know that He will forgive you if you humbly receive Him as your Savior.
He was pierced, wounded, and crushed, all because of our sin.
Friend, Jesus Christ endured all this so that you might have all your sins forgiven.
Because of His suffering, our lives can be redeemed and made whole.
“...Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you...” (Psalm 50:15).
Nothing you have ever done is too bad for Jesus to forgive.
Some of His choicest servants committed gross sins like murder (Moses), murder and adultery (King David), and physical and emotional abuse (the apostle Paul).
 Come to Jesus, and let Him restore your joy and usefulness as you trust Him to begin a new work in your life.
“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
Why should you not commit suicide?
Friend, God stands ready to repair what is “broken,” namely, the life you have now, the life you want to end by suicide.
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor…to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve…to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.”
 Come to Jesus, and let Him restore your joy and usefulness as you trust Him to begin a new work in your life.
He promises to restore the joy you have lost and give you a new spirit to sustain you.
Your broken heart is precious to Him: “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise” (Psalm 51:12, 15-17).
Your broken heart is precious to Him: “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise” (Psalm 51:12, 15-17).
Will you accept the Lord as your Savior and Shepherd?
He will guide your thoughts and steps—one day at a time—through His Word, the Bible.
“I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you” (Psalm 32:8).
“He will be the sure foundation for your times, a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is the key to this treasure” (Isaiah 33:6).
In Christ, you will still have struggles, but you will now have hope.
He is “a friend who sticks closer than a brother” (Proverbs 18:24).
May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you in your hour of decision.
If you desire to trust Jesus Christ as your Savior, speak these words in your heart to God: “God, I need you in my life.
Please forgive me for all that I have done.
I place my faith in Jesus Christ and believe that He is my Savior.
Please cleanse me, heal me, and restore my joy in life.
Thank You for Your love for me and for Jesus’ death on my behalf.”
