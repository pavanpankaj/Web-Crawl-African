                                                                                         Answer
 In Matthew 5:21-28, Jesus equates committing adultery with having lust in your heart and committing murder with having hatred in your heart.
However, this does not mean the sins are equal.
What Jesus was trying to get across to the Pharisees is that sin is still sin even if you only want to do the act, without actually carrying it out.
The religious leaders of Jesus’ day taught that it was okay to think about anything you wanted to, as long as you did not act on those desires.
Jesus is forcing them to realize that God judges a person’s thoughts as well as his actions.
Jesus proclaimed that our actions are the result of what is in our hearts (Matthew 12:34).
Jesus proclaimed that our actions are the result of what is in our hearts (Matthew 12:34).
So, although Jesus said that lust and adultery are both sins, that does not mean they are equal.
It is much worse to actually murder a person than it is to simply hate a person, even though they are both sins in God’s sight.
There are degrees to sin.
Some sins are worse than others.
At the same time, in regard to both eternal consequences and salvation, all sins are the same.
Every sin will lead to eternal condemnation (Romans 6:23).
All sin, no matter how “small,” is against an infinite and eternal God, and is therefore worthy of an infinite and eternal penalty.
Further, there is no sin too “big” that God cannot forgive.
Jesus died to pay the penalty for sin (1 John 2:2).
No.
Jesus died for all of our sins (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus died for all of our sins (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Are all sins equal to God?
Yes.
In penalty?
No.
Yes.
Yes.
In forgivability?
Yes.

 First, it is important to recognize that this is not a question of whether God still performs miracles today.
It would be foolish and unbiblical to claim God does not heal people, speak to people, and perform miraculous signs and wonders today.
The question is whether the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, described primarily in 1 Corinthians 12–14, are still active in the church today.
This is also not a question of can the Holy Spirit give someone a miraculous gift.
The question is whether the Holy Spirit still dispenses the miraculous gifts today.
Above all else, we entirely recognize that the Holy Spirit is free to dispense gifts according to His will (1 Corinthians 12:7-11).
In the book of Acts and the Epistles, the vast majority of miracles are performed by the apostles and their close associates.
Paul gives us the reason why: “The things that mark an apostle—signs, wonders and miracles—were done among you with great perseverance” (2 Corinthians 12:12).
If every believer in Christ was equipped with the ability to perform signs, wonders, and miracles, then signs, wonders, and miracles could in no way be the identifying marks of an apostle.
Acts 2:22 tells us that Jesus was “accredited” by “miracles, wonders, and signs.” Similarly, the apostles were “marked” as genuine messengers from God by the miracles they performed.
Acts 2:22 tells us that Jesus was “accredited” by “miracles, wonders, and signs.” Similarly, the apostles were “marked” as genuine messengers from God by the miracles they performed.
Acts 14:3 describes the gospel message being “confirmed” by the miracles Paul and Barnabas performed.
Chapters 12–14 of 1 Corinthians deal primarily with the subject of the gifts of the Spirit.
From what we learned above, that the apostles were “marked” by signs and wonders, it would seem that miraculous gifts being given to “ordinary” Christians was the exception, not the rule.
We are not told how commonplace this was.
From what we learned above, that the apostles were “marked” by signs and wonders, it would seem that miraculous gifts being given to “ordinary” Christians was the exception, not the rule.
Beside the apostles and their close associates, the New Testament nowhere specifically describes individuals exercising the miraculous gifts of the Spirit.
It is also important to realize that the early church did not have the completed Bible, as we do today (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
Therefore, the gifts of prophecy, knowledge, wisdom, etc.
The gift of prophecy enabled believers to communicate new truth and revelation from God.
Now that God’s revelation is complete in the Bible, the “revelatory” gifts are no longer needed, at least not in the same capacity as they were in the New Testament.
God miraculously heals people every day.
Therefore, the gifts of prophecy, knowledge, wisdom, etc.
God still does amazing miracles, signs, and wonders and sometimes performs those miracles through a Christian.
However, these things are not necessarily the miraculous gifts of the Spirit.
The primary purpose of the miraculous gifts was to prove that the gospel was true and that the apostles were truly God’s messengers.
The Bible does not say outright that the miraculous gifts have ceased, but it does lay the foundation for why they might no longer occur to the same extent as they did as recorded in the New Testament.

 First, let’s define “aliens” as “beings capable of making moral choices, having intellect, emotion, and a will.” Next, a few scientific facts:
 1.
Men have sent spacecraft to nearly every planet in our solar system.
After observing these planets, we have ruled out all but Mars and possibly a moon of Jupiter as being able to support life.
2.
In 1976, the U.S.A. sent two landers to Mars.
Each had instruments that could dig into the Martian sand and analyze it for any sign of life.
They found absolutely nothing.
In contrast, if you analyzed soil from the most barren desert on earth or the most frozen dirt in Antarctica, you would find it teeming with micro-organisms.
In 1997, the U.S.A. sent Pathfinder to the surface of Mars.
This rover took more samples and conducted many more experiments.
It also found absolutely no sign of life.
Since that time, several more missions to Mars have been launched.
The results have always been the same.
3.
Astronomers are constantly finding new planets in distant solar systems.
Some propose that the existence of so many planets proves that there must be life somewhere else in the universe.
The fact is that none of these has ever been proven to be anything close to a life-supporting planet.
The tremendous distance between Earth and these planets makes it impossible to make any judgments regarding their ability to sustain life.
Knowing that Earth alone supports life in our solar system, evolutionists want very badly to find another planet in another solar system to support the notion that life must have evolved.
There are many other planets out there, but we certainly do not know enough about them to verify that they could support life.
So, what does the Bible say?
The earth and mankind are unique in God’s creation.
Genesis 1 teaches that God created the earth before He even created the sun, the moon, or the stars.
Acts 17:24-26 states that “the God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands…he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.”
 Originally, mankind was without sin, and everything in the world was “very good” (Genesis 1:31).
When the first man sinned (Genesis 3), the result was problems of all sorts, including sickness and death.
Even though animals have no personal sin before God (they are not moral beings), they still suffer and die (Romans 8:19-22).
Jesus Christ died to remove the punishment that we deserve for our sin.
When He returns, He will undo the curse that has existed since Adam (Revelation 21–22).
Note that Romans 8:19-22 states that all of creation eagerly waits for this time.
It is important to also note that Christ came to die for mankind and that He died only once (Hebrews 7:27; 9:26-28; 10:10).
If all of creation now suffers under the curse, any life apart from the earth would also suffer.
If, for the sake of argument, moral beings do exist on other planets, then they also suffer; and if not now, then someday they will surely suffer when everything passes away with a great noise and the elements melt with fervent heat (2 Peter 3:10).
If they had never sinned, then God would be unjust in punishing them.
But if they had sinned, and Christ could die only once (which He did on earth), then they are left in their sin, which would also be contrary to the character of God (2 Peter 3:9).
This leaves us with an unsolvable paradox—unless, of course, there are no moral beings outside of the earth.
What about non-moral and non-sentient life forms on other planets?
Could algae or even dogs and cats be present on an unknown planet?
Presumably so, and it would not do any real harm to any biblical text.
But it would certainly prove problematic when trying answer questions like “Since all of creation suffers, what purpose would God have in creating non-moral and non-sentient creatures to suffer on distant planets?”
 In conclusion, the Bible gives us no reason to believe that there is life elsewhere in the universe.
In fact, the Bible gives us several key reasons why there cannot be.
Yes, there are many strange and unexplainable things that take place.
There is no reason, though, to attribute these phenomena to aliens or UFOs.
If there is a discernable cause to these supposed events, it is likely to be spiritual, and more specifically, demonic, in origin.

 Miscellaneous Bible Questions
                                                                                         Answer
 Calvinism and Arminianism are two systems of theology that attempt to explain the relationship between God’s sovereignty and man’s responsibility in the matter of salvation.
Calvinism is named for John Calvin, a French theologian who lived from 1509-1564.
Arminianism is named for Jacobus Arminius, a Dutch theologian who lived from 1560-1609.
Both systems can be summarized with five points.
Calvinism holds to the total depravity of man while Arminianism holds to partial depravity.
Calvinism’s doctrine of total depravity states that every aspect of humanity is corrupted by sin; therefore, human beings are unable to come to God on their own accord.
Partial depravity states that every aspect of humanity is tainted by sin, but not to the extent that human beings are unable to place faith in God of their own accord.
Calvinism includes the belief that election is unconditional, while Arminianism believes in conditional election.
Conditional election states that God elects individuals to salvation based on His foreknowledge of who will believe in Christ unto salvation, thereby on the condition that the individual chooses God.
Conditional election states that God elects individuals to salvation based on His foreknowledge of who will believe in Christ unto salvation, thereby on the condition that the individual chooses God.
Calvinism sees the atonement as limited, while Arminianism sees it as unlimited.
This is the most controversial of the five points.
Limited atonement is the belief that Jesus only died for the elect.
Unlimited atonement is the belief that Jesus died for all, but that His death is not effectual until a person receives Him by faith.
Calvinism includes the belief that God’s grace is irresistible, while Arminianism says that an individual can resist the grace of God.
Irresistible grace argues that when God calls a person to salvation, that person will inevitably come to salvation.
Resistible grace states that God calls all to salvation, but that many people resist and reject this call.
Calvinism holds to perseverance of the saints while Arminianism holds to conditional salvation.
Perseverance of the saints refers to the concept that a person who is elected by God will persevere in faith and will not permanently deny Christ or turn away from Him.
Conditional salvation is the view that a believer in Christ can, of his/her own free will, turn away from Christ and thereby lose salvation.
So, in the Calvinism vs. Arminianism debate, who is correct?
It is interesting to note that in the diversity of the body of Christ, there are all sorts of mixtures of Calvinism and Arminianism.
There are five-point Calvinists and five-point Arminians, and at the same time three-point Calvinists and two-point Arminians.
Many believers arrive at some sort of mixture of the two views.
Ultimately, it is our view that both systems fail in that they attempt to explain the unexplainable.
Yes, God is absolutely sovereign and knows all.
Yes, human beings are called to make a genuine decision to place faith in Christ unto salvation.
These two facts seem contradictory to us, but in the mind of God they make perfect sense.

 While the Bible does not explicitly state whether a Christian can be possessed by a demon, related biblical truths make it abundantly clear that Christians cannot be demon possessed.
There is a distinct difference between being possessed by a demon and being oppressed or influenced by a demon.
Demon oppression or influence involves a demon or demons attacking a person spiritually and/or encouraging him/her into sinful behavior.
Demon oppression or influence involves a demon or demons attacking a person spiritually and/or encouraging him/her into sinful behavior.
Notice that in all the New Testament passages dealing with spiritual warfare, there are no instructions to cast a demon out of a believer (Ephesians 6:10-18).
Christians are indwelt by the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:9-11; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 6:19).
Believers are told to resist the devil (James 4:7; 1 Peter 5:8-9), not to cast him out.
Christians are indwelt by the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:9-11; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 6:19).
Surely the Holy Spirit would not allow a demon to possess the same person He is indwelling.
It is unthinkable that God would allow one of His children, whom He purchased with the blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18-19) and made into a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), to be possessed and controlled by a demon.
Surely the Holy Spirit would not allow a demon to possess the same person He is indwelling.
The apostle John declares, “You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the One who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world” (1 John 4:4).
The Holy Spirit.
Who is the One in us?
The Holy Spirit.
Who is the one in the world?
Satan and his demons.
So, the same issue results.
Typically, the description of demonization is virtually identical to the description of demon possession.
With the strong biblical evidence that a Christian cannot be demon possessed in view, some Bible teachers use the term “demonization” to refer to a demon having control over a Christian.
Some argue that while a Christian cannot be demon possessed, a Christian can be demonized.
Typically, the description of demonization is virtually identical to the description of demon possession.
So, the same issue results.
Changing the terminology does not change the fact that a demon cannot inhabit or take full control of a Christian.
Demonic influence and oppression are realities for Christians, no doubt, but it is simply not biblical to say that a Christian can be possessed by a demon or demonized.
Much of the reasoning behind the demonization concept is the personal experience of seeing someone who was “definitely” a Christian exhibiting evidence of being controlled by a demon.
It is crucially important, though, that we do not allow personal experience to influence our interpretation of Scripture.
It is crucially important, though, that we do not allow personal experience to influence our interpretation of Scripture.
Seeing someone whom we thought to be a Christian exhibiting the behavior of being demonized should cause us to question the genuineness of his/her faith.
Perhaps the person truly is a Christian but is severely demon oppressed and/or suffering from severe psychological problems.
But again, our experiences must meet the test of Scripture, not the other way around.

 The word “monotheism” comes from two words, “mono” meaning “single” and “theism” meaning “belief in God.” Specifically, monotheism is the belief in one true God who is the only creator, sustainer, and judge of all creation.
Monotheism differs from “henotheism,” which is the belief in multiple gods with one supreme God over all.
It is also opposed to polytheism, which is the belief in the existence of more than one god.
There are many arguments for monotheism, including those from special revelation (Scripture), natural revelation (philosophy), as well as historical anthropology.
These will only be explained briefly below, and this should not in any way be considered an exhaustive list.
Biblical arguments for Monotheism - Deuteronomy 4:35: “You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides Him there is no other.” Deuteronomy 6:4: “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.” Malachi 2:10a, “Have we not all one Father?
Did not one God create us?” 1 Corinthians 8:6: “Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.” Ephesians 4:6: “One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.” 1 Timothy 2:5: “For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” James 2:19: “You believe that there is one God.
Good!
Even the demons believe that—and shudder.”
 Obviously, for many people, it wouldn’t suffice to simply say that there is only one God because the Bible says so.
This is because without God there is no way to prove that the Bible is His Word in the first place.
However, one might argue that since the Bible has the most reliable supernatural evidence confirming what it teaches, monotheism can be affirmed on these grounds.
A similar argument would be the beliefs and teaching of Jesus Christ, who proved that He was God (or at the very least approved by God) by His miraculous birth, life, and the miracle of His resurrection.
God cannot lie or be deceived; therefore, what Jesus believed and taught was true.
Therefore, monotheism, which Jesus believed and taught, is true.
This argument may not be very impressive to those unfamiliar with the case for the supernatural confirmations of Scripture and Christ, but this is a good place to start for one who is familiar with its strength.
Historical arguments for Monotheism - Arguments based on popularity are notoriously suspect, but it is interesting just how much monotheism has affected world religions.
The popular evolutionary theory of religious development stems from an evolutionary view of reality in general, and the presupposition of evolutionary anthropology which sees “primitive” cultures as representing the earlier stages of religious development.
But the problems with this evolutionary theory are several.
1) The kind of development it describes has never been observed; in fact, there seems to be no upward development toward monotheism within any culture—actually the opposite seems to be the case.
2) The anthropological method’s definition of “primitive” equates to technological development, yet this is hardly a satisfactory criterion as there are so many components to a given culture.
3) The alleged stages are often missing or skipped.
4) Finally, most polytheistic cultures show vestiges of monotheism early in their development.
What we find is a monotheistic God who is personal, masculine, lives in the sky, has great knowledge and power, created the world, is the author of a morality to which we are accountable, and whom we have disobeyed and are thus estranged from, but who has also provided a way of reconciliation.
Virtually every religion carries a variation of this God at some point in its past before devolving into the chaos of polytheism.
Thus, it seems that most religions have begun in monotheism and “devolved” into polytheism, animism, and magic—not vice versa.
(Islam is a very rare case, having come full circle back into a monotheistic belief.)
Even with this movement, polytheism is often functionally monotheistic or henotheistic.
It is a rare polytheistic religion which does not hold one of its gods as sovereign over the rest, with the lesser gods only functioning as intermediaries.
Philosophical/Theological arguments for Monotheism - There are many philosophical arguments for the impossibility of there being more than one God in existence.
Many of these depend a great deal on one’s metaphysical position concerning the nature of reality.
Unfortunately, in an article this short it would be impossible to argue for these basic metaphysical positions and then go on to show what they point to regarding monotheism, but rest assured that there are strong philosophical and theological grounds for these truths that go back millennia (and most are fairly self-evident).
Briefly, then, here are three arguments one might choose to explore:
 1.
If there were more than one God, the universe would be in disorder because of multiple creators and authorities, but it is not in disorder; therefore, there is only one God.
2.
Since God is a completely perfect being, there cannot be a second God, for they would have to differ in some way, and to differ from complete perfection is to be less than perfect and not be God.
3.
Since God is infinite in His existence, He cannot have parts (for parts cannot be added to reach infinity).
If God’s existence is not just a part of Him (which it is for all things which can have existence or not), then He must have infinite existence.
Therefore, there cannot be two infinite beings, for one would have to differ from the other.
Someone may wish to argue that many of these would not rule out a sub-class of “gods,” and that is fine.
Although we know this to be untrue biblically, there is nothing wrong with it in theory.
In other words, God could have created a sub-class of “gods,” but it just happens to be the case that He did not.
If He had, these “gods” would only be limited, created things—probably a lot like angels (Psalm 82).
This does not hurt the case for monotheism, which does not say that there cannot be any other spirit beings—only that there cannot be more than one God.

 Some see in Hebrews 12:1 the idea that people in heaven might be able to look down and see us: “Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses.
                                                                                         Answer
Their Old Testament stories give testimony to the blessings of choosing faith over fear.
.” The “witnesses” are the heroes of faith listed in Hebrews 11, and the fact that we are “surrounded” by them leads some commentators to understand those heroes (and possibly other people) are looking down on us from heaven.
The proper interpretation of Hebrews 12:1 is that the men and women forming the “great cloud of witnesses” are witness to the value of living life by faith.
Hebrews 12:1 continues, “Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.” Because of the faith and endurance of believers who went before us, we are inspired to stay the course in our own race of faith.
The Bible doesn’t specifically say that people in heaven cannot look down on us, so we can’t be dogmatic.
However, it is unlikely that they can.
.
Again, this passage says nothing about the martyrs seeing people on earth; it simply says that they knew they deserved justice and desired the Lord to take action.
Hebrews 12:2 keeps our focus where it belongs: “Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.” Jesus is our blessed hope, no other (Titus 2:13).
People in heaven are likely preoccupied with other things such as worshiping God and enjoying the glories of heaven.

 GotQuestions.org is not a Christian dream interpretation service.
We do not interpret dreams.
We strongly believe that a person’s dreams and the meaning of those dreams are between the person and God alone.
In the past, God spoke to people sometimes in dreams.
Examples are Joseph, son of Jacob (Genesis 37:5–10); Joseph, the husband of Mary (Matthew 2:12–22); Solomon (1 Kings 3:5–15); and several others (Daniel 2:1; 7:1; Matthew 27:19).
There is also a prophecy of the prophet Joel (Joel 2:28), quoted by the apostle Peter in Acts 2:17, that mentions God using dreams.
So God can speak through dreams, if He chooses to.
However, we must keep in mind that the Bible is complete, having revealed everything we need to know from now until eternity.
This is not to say that God does not work miracles or even speak through dreams today, but anything God says, whether through a dream, vision, impression, or “still small voice,” will agree completely with what He has already revealed in His Word.
Dreams cannot usurp the authority of Scripture.
If you have a dream and feel that perhaps God gave it to you, prayerfully examine the Word of God and make sure your dream is in agreement with Scripture.
If it is, prayerfully consider what God would have you do in response to your dream (James 1:5).
In Scripture, whenever anyone experienced a dream from God, God always made the meaning of the dream clear, whether directly to the person, through an angel, or through another messenger (Genesis 40:5–11; Daniel 2:45; 4:19).
When God speaks to us, He makes sure His message is clearly understood.

 Scripture does not command Christians to fast.
God does not require or demand it of Christians.
At the same time, the Bible presents fasting as something that is good, profitable, and beneficial.
The book of Acts records believers fasting before they made important decisions (Acts 13:2; 14:23).
Fasting and prayer are often linked together (Luke 2:37; 5:33).
Too often, the focus of fasting is on the lack of food.
Instead, the purpose of fasting should be to take your eyes off the things of this world to focus completely on God.
Fasting is a way to demonstrate to God, and to ourselves, that we are serious about our relationship with Him.
Fasting helps us gain a new perspective and a renewed reliance upon God.
Although fasting in Scripture is almost always a fasting from food, there are other ways to fast.
Anything given up temporarily in order to focus all our attention on God can be considered a fast (1 Corinthians 7:1-5).
Fasting should be limited to a set time, especially when fasting from food.
Extended periods of time without eating can be harmful to the body.
The purpose of a biblical fast is not to lose weight, but rather to gain deeper fellowship with God.
Fasting should not be considered a “dieting method” either.
The purpose of a biblical fast is not to lose weight, but rather to gain deeper fellowship with God.
Anyone can fast, but some may not be able to fast from food (diabetics, for example).
Everyone can temporarily give up something in order to draw closer to God.
By taking our eyes off the things of this world, we can more successfully turn our attention to Christ.
Fasting is not a way to get God to do what we want.
Fasting changes us, not God.
Fasting is not a way to appear more spiritual than others.
Fasting is to be done in a spirit of humility and a joyful attitude.
Matthew 6:16-18 declares, “When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting.
I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.

 There are two sides to this interesting question.
It is important to remember that this is not a question of whether Jesus sinned.
Both sides agree, as the Bible clearly says, that Jesus did not sin (2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 2:22).
The question is whether Jesus could have sinned.
Those who hold to “impeccability” believe that Jesus could not have sinned.
Those who hold to “peccability” believe that Jesus could have sinned, but did not.
Which view is correct?
The clear teaching of Scripture is that Jesus was impeccable—Jesus could not have sinned.
If He could have sinned, He would still be able to sin today because He retains the same essence He did while living on earth.
He is the God-Man and will forever remain so, having full deity and full humanity so united in one person as to be indivisible.
To believe that Jesus could sin is to believe that God could sin.
“For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him” (Colossians 1:19).
Colossians 2:9 adds, “For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form.”
 Although Jesus is fully human, He was not born with the sinful nature that we are born with.
He certainly was tempted in the same way we are, in that temptations were put before Him by Satan, yet He remained sinless because God is incapable of sinning.
It is against His very nature (Matthew 4:1; Hebrews 2:18, 4:15; James 1:13).
Sin is by definition a trespass of the Law.
God created the Law, and the Law is by nature what God would or would not do; therefore, sin is anything that God would not do by His very nature.
To be tempted is not, in and of itself, sinful.
A person could tempt you with something you have no desire to do, such as committing murder or participating in sexual perversions.
You probably have no desire whatsoever to take part in these actions, but you were still tempted because someone placed the possibility before you.
There are at least two definitions for the word “tempted”:
 1) To have a sinful proposition suggested to you by someone or something outside yourself or by your own sin nature.
2) To consider actually participating in a sinful act and the possible pleasures and consequences of such an act to the degree that the act is already taking place in your mind.
The first definition does not describe a sinful act/thought; the second does.
When you dwell upon a sinful act and consider how you might be able to bring it to pass, you have crossed the line of sin.
Jesus was tempted in the fashion of definition one except that He was never tempted by a sin nature because it did not exist within Him.
Satan proposed certain sinful acts to Jesus, but He had no inner desire to participate in the sin.
Therefore, He was tempted like we are but remained sinless.
Those who hold to peccability believe that, if Jesus could not have sinned, He could not have truly experienced temptation, and therefore could not truly empathize with our struggles and temptations against sin.
We have to remember that one does not have to experience something in order to understand it.
God knows everything about everything.
While God has never had the desire to sin, and has most definitely never sinned, God knows and understands what sin is.
God knows and understands what it is like to be tempted.
Jesus can empathize with our temptations because He knows, not because He has “experienced” all the same things we have.
Jesus knows what it is like to be tempted, but He does not know what it is like to sin.
This does not prevent Him from assisting us.
We are tempted with sins that are common to man (1 Corinthians 10:13).
These sins generally can be boiled down to three different types: “the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life” (1 John 2:16 NKJV).
Examine the temptation and sin of Eve, as well as the temptation of Jesus, and you will find that the temptations for each came from these three categories.
Jesus was tempted in every way and in every area that we are, but remained perfectly holy.
Although our corrupt natures will have the inner desire to participate in some sins, we have the ability, through Christ, to overcome sin because we are no longer slaves to sin but rather slaves of God (Romans 6, especially verses 2 and 16-22).

 At first it might seem that if God created all things, then evil must have been created by God.
However, evil is not a “thing” like a rock or electricity.
You cannot have a jar of evil.
Evil has no existence of its own; it is really the absence of good.
For example, holes are real but they only exist in something else.
So when God created, it is true that all He created was good.
One of the good things God made was creatures who had the freedom to choose good.
In order to have a real choice, God had to allow there to be something besides good to choose.
When a bad relationship exists between two good things we call that evil, but it does not become a “thing” that required God to create it.
Perhaps a further illustration will help.
If a person is asked, “Does cold exist?” the answer would likely be “yes.” However, this is incorrect.

Cold does not exist.
Cold does not exist.

Similarly, darkness does not exist; it is the absence of light.
Evil is the absence of good, or better, evil is the absence of God.
God did not create evil, but He does allow evil.
Similarly, darkness does not exist; it is the absence of light.
He did not want “robots” that simply did what He wanted them to do because of their “programming.” God allowed for the possibility of evil so that we could genuinely have a free will and choose whether or not we wanted to serve Him.

As finite human beings, we can never fully understand an infinite God (Romans 11:33-34).
Sometimes we think we understand why God is doing something, only to find out later that it was for a different purpose than we originally thought.
God looks at things from a holy, eternal perspective.
We look at things from a sinful, earthly, and temporal perspective.
Why did God put man on earth knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and therefore bring evil, death, and suffering on all mankind?
Why didn’t He just create us all and leave us in heaven where we would be perfect and without suffering?
These questions cannot be adequately answered this side of eternity.
What we can know is whatever God does is holy and perfect and ultimately will glorify Him.
Why didn’t He just create us all and leave us in heaven where we would be perfect and without suffering?
If God, Why Evil?
If He had not allowed evil, we would be worshiping Him out of obligation, not by a choice of our own will.

 There is a great deal of confusion in regards to this question.
The concept that Jesus went to hell after His death on the cross comes primarily from the Apostles’ Creed, which states, “He descended into hell.” There are also a few Scriptures which, depending on how they are translated, describe Jesus going to “hell.” In studying this issue, it is important to first understand what the Bible teaches about the realm of the dead.
In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word used to describe the realm of the dead is sheol.
In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word used to describe the realm of the dead is sheol.
In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word used to describe the realm of the dead is sheol.
It simply means “the place of the dead” or “the place of departed souls/spirits.” The New Testament Greek equivalent of sheol is hades, which also refers to “the place of the dead.” Other Scriptures in the New Testament indicate that sheol/hades is a temporary place, where souls are kept as they await the final resurrection and judgment.

Revelation 20:11–15 gives a clear distinction between hades and the lake of fire.
The lake of fire is the permanent and final place of judgment for the lost.
Hades, then, is a temporary place.
When Jesus died, He went to the blessed side of sheol and, from there, took the believers with Him to heaven (Ephesians 4:8–10).
The judgment side of sheol/hades has remained unchanged.
Sheol/hades was a realm with two divisions—a place of blessing and a place of judgment (Matthew 11:23; 16:18; Luke 10:15; 16:23; Acts 2:27–31).
The abode of the saved is also called “Abraham’s bosom” (KJV) or “Abraham’s side” (NIV) in Luke 16:22 and “paradise” in Luke 23:43.
The abodes of the saved and the lost are separated by a “great chasm” (Luke 16:26).
When Jesus died, He went to the blessed side of sheol and, from there, took the believers with Him to heaven (Ephesians 4:8–10).
The judgment side of sheol/hades has remained unchanged.
All unbelieving dead go there awaiting their final judgment in the future.
Did Jesus go to sheol/hades?
Yes, according to Ephesians 4:8–10 and 1 Peter 3:18–20.
Some of the confusion has arisen from such passages as Psalm 16:10–11 as translated in the King James Version: “For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Thou wilt show me the path of life.” “Hell” is not a correct translation in this verse.
Unfortunately, in many versions of the Bible, translators are not consistent, or correct, in how they translate the Hebrew and Greek words for “sheol,” “hades,” and “hell.”
A correct reading would be “the grave” or “sheol.” Jesus said to the thief beside Him, “Today you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43); He did not say, “I will see you in hell.” Jesus’ body was in the tomb; His soul/spirit went to be with the blessed in sheol/hades.

It was the death of Jesus on the cross that sufficiently provided for our redemption.
Unfortunately, in many versions of the Bible, translators are not consistent, or correct, in how they translate the Hebrew and Greek words for “sheol,” “hades,” and “hell.”
 Some have the viewpoint that Jesus went to “hell” or the suffering side of sheol/hades in order to further be punished for our sins.
This idea is completely unbiblical.
It was the death of Jesus on the cross that sufficiently provided for our redemption.
This imputation of sin helps us understand Christ’s struggle in the garden of Gethsemane with the cup of sin which would be poured out upon Him on the cross.
As He hung there on the cross, He took the sin burden of the whole human race upon Himself.
It was His shed blood that effected our own cleansing from sin (1 John 1:7–9).
This imputation of sin helps us understand Christ’s struggle in the garden of Gethsemane with the cup of sin which would be poured out upon Him on the cross.
As Jesus neared death, He said, “It is finished” (John 19:30).
He then awaited the resurrection of His body and His return to glory in His ascension.
As Jesus neared death, He said, “It is finished” (John 19:30).
His suffering in our place was completed.

Jesus’ suffering ended the moment He died.
The payment for sin was paid.

Did Jesus go to sheol/hades?
No.

 Typically, when this question is asked, the person asking qualifies the question with “outside of the Bible.” We do not grant this idea that the Bible cannot be considered a source of evidence for the existence of Jesus.
 Typically, when this question is asked, the person asking qualifies the question with “outside of the Bible.” We do not grant this idea that the Bible cannot be considered a source of evidence for the existence of Jesus.
The New Testament contains hundreds of references to Jesus Christ.
There are those who date the writing of the Gospels to the second century A.D., more than 100 years after Jesus’ death.
Even if this were the case (which we strongly dispute), in terms of ancient evidences, writings less than 200 years after events took place are considered very reliable evidences.
Further, the vast majority of scholars (Christian and non-Christian) will grant that the Epistles of Paul (at least some of them) were in fact written by Paul in the middle of the first century A.D., less than 40 years after Jesus’ death.
In terms of ancient manuscript evidence, this is extraordinarily strong proof of the existence of a man named Jesus in Israel in the early first century A.D.
It is also important to recognize that in A.D. 70, the Romans invaded and destroyed Jerusalem and most of Israel, slaughtering its inhabitants.
Entire cities were literally burned to the ground.
We should not be surprised, then, if much evidence of Jesus’ existence was destroyed.
Many of the eyewitnesses of Jesus would have been killed.
These facts likely limited the amount of surviving eyewitness testimony of Jesus.
Considering that Jesus’ ministry was largely confined to a relatively unimportant area in a small corner of the Roman Empire, a surprising amount of information about Jesus can be drawn from secular historical sources.
Some of the more important historical evidences of Jesus include the following:
 The first-century Roman Tacitus, who is considered one of the more accurate historians of the ancient world, mentioned superstitious “Christians” (from Christus, which is Latin for Christ), who suffered under Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius.
Suetonius, chief secretary to Emperor Hadrian, wrote that there was a man named Chrestus (or Christ) who lived during the first century (Annals 15.44).
Suetonius, chief secretary to Emperor Hadrian, wrote that there was a man named Chrestus (or Christ) who lived during the first century (Annals 15.44).
Flavius Josephus is the most famous Jewish historian.
In his Antiquities he refers to James, “the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ.” There is a controversial verse (18:3) that says, “Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man.
In his Antiquities he refers to James, “the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ.” There is a controversial verse (18:3) that says, “Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man.
For he was one who wrought surprising feats....He was [the] Christ...he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him.” One version reads, “At this time there was a wise man named Jesus.
 Julius Africanus quotes the historian Thallus in a discussion of the darkness that followed the crucifixion of Christ (Extant Writings, 18).
His conduct was good and [he] was known to be virtuous.
They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive; accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah, concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders.”
Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die.
But those who became his disciples did not abandon his discipleship.
They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive; accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah, concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders.”
 Julius Africanus quotes the historian Thallus in a discussion of the darkness that followed the crucifixion of Christ (Extant Writings, 18).
Pliny the Younger, in Letters 10:96, recorded early Christian worship practices including the fact that Christians worshiped Jesus as God and were very ethical, and he includes a reference to the love feast and Lord’s Supper.
The Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a) confirms Jesus’ crucifixion on the eve of Passover and the accusations against Christ of practicing sorcery and encouraging Jewish apostasy.
Lucian of Samosata was a second-century Greek writer who admits that Jesus was worshiped by Christians, introduced new teachings, and was crucified for them.
He said that Jesus’ teachings included the brotherhood of believers, the importance of conversion, and the importance of denying other gods.
Christians lived according to Jesus’ laws, believed themselves to be immortal, and were characterized by contempt for death, and renunciation of material goods.
Mara Bar-Serapion confirms that Jesus was thought to be a wise and virtuous man, was considered by many to be the king of Israel, was put to death by the Jews, and lived on in the teachings of His followers.
Then we have all the Gnostic writings (The Gospel of Truth, The Apocryphon of John, The Gospel of Thomas, The Treatise on Resurrection, etc.)
In fact, we can almost reconstruct the gospel just from early non-Christian sources: Jesus was called the Christ (Josephus), did “magic,” led Israel into new teachings, and was hanged on Passover for them (Babylonian Talmud) in Judea (Tacitus), but claimed to be God and would return (Eliezar), which his followers believed, worshiping Him as God (Pliny the Younger).
There is overwhelming evidence for the existence of Jesus Christ, both in secular and biblical history.
Perhaps the greatest evidence that Jesus did exist is the fact that literally thousands of Christians in the first century AD, including the twelve apostles, were willing to give their lives as martyrs for Jesus Christ.
People will die for what they believe to be true, but no one will die for what they know to be a lie.

 Romans 13:1-7 states, “Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.
The authorities that exist have been established by God.
Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong.
Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority?
For he is God’s servant to do you good.
Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority?
For he is God’s servant to do you good.
But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing.
Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.
Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.
This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing.
Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.”
  This passage makes it abundantly clear that we are to obey the government God places over us.
When the apostle Paul wrote to the Romans, he was under the government of Rome during the reign of Nero, perhaps the most evil of all the Roman emperors.
God created government to establish order, punish evil, and promote justice (Genesis 9:6; 1 Corinthians 14:33; Romans 12:8).
The next question is “Is there a time when we should intentionally disobey the laws of the land?” The answer to that question may be found in Acts 5:27-29, “Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.
If we do not, we are ultimately showing disrespect towards God, for He is the One who placed that government over us.
'Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man’s blood.'
Paul still recognized the Roman government’s rule over him.
'Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man’s blood.'
'We gave you strict orders not to teach in this Name,' he said.
'“ From this, it is clear that as long as the law of the land does not contradict the law of God, we are bound to obey the law of the land.
This is demonstrated by the fact that Peter and John did not protest being flogged, but instead rejoiced that they suffered for obeying God (Acts 5:40-42).

 The key to understanding the relationship between the Christian and the Law is knowing that the Old Testament law was given to the nation of Israel, not to Christians.
Some of the laws were to reveal to the Israelites how to obey and please God (the Ten Commandments, for example).
Some of the laws were to show the Israelites how to worship God and atone for sin (the sacrificial system).
Some of the laws were intended to make the Israelites distinct from other nations (the food and clothing rules).
None of the Old Testament law is binding on Christians today.
When Jesus died on the cross, He put an end to the Old Testament law (Romans 10:4; Galatians 3:23–25; Ephesians 2:15).
When Jesus died on the cross, He put an end to the Old Testament law (Romans 10:4; Galatians 3:23–25; Ephesians 2:15).
In place of the Old Testament law, Christians are under the law of Christ (Galatians 6:2), which is to “love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind…and to love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37-39).
In place of the Old Testament law, Christians are under the law of Christ (Galatians 6:2), which is to “love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind…and to love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37-39).
If we obey those two commands, we will be fulfilling all that Christ requires of us: “All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments” (Matthew 22:40).
If we obey those two commands, we will be fulfilling all that Christ requires of us: “All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments” (Matthew 22:40).
Now, this does not mean the Old Testament law is irrelevant today.
Many of the commands in the Old Testament law fall into the categories of “loving God” and “loving your neighbor.” The Old Testament law can be a good guidepost for knowing how to love God and knowing what goes into loving your neighbor.
Many of the commands in the Old Testament law fall into the categories of “loving God” and “loving your neighbor.” The Old Testament law can be a good guidepost for knowing how to love God and knowing what goes into loving your neighbor.
At the same time, to say that the Old Testament law applies to Christians today is incorrect.
The Old Testament law is a unit (James 2:10).
If Christ fulfilled some of it, such as the sacrificial system, He fulfilled all of it.
If Christ fulfilled some of it, such as the sacrificial system, He fulfilled all of it.
The purpose of the Old Testament law is to convict people of our inability to keep the law and point us to our need for Jesus Christ as Savior (Romans 7:7-9; Galatians 3:24).
The Ten Commandments were essentially a summary of the entire Old Testament law.
Nine of the Ten Commandments are clearly repeated in the New Testament (all except the command to observe the Sabbath day).
Obviously, if we are loving God, we will not be worshiping false gods or bowing down before idols.
If we are loving our neighbors, we will not be murdering them, lying to them, committing adultery against them, or coveting what belongs to them.
The purpose of the Old Testament law is to convict people of our inability to keep the law and point us to our need for Jesus Christ as Savior (Romans 7:7-9; Galatians 3:24).
The Old Testament law was never intended by God to be the universal law for all people for all of time.
We are to love God and love our neighbors.
If we obey those two commands faithfully, we will be upholding all that God requires of us.

 Submission is an important issue in relation to marriage.
Here is the plain biblical command: “Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.
Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything” (Ephesians 5:22–24).
Even before sin entered the world, there was still the principle of the headship of the husband (1 Timothy 2:13).
Adam was created first, and Eve was created to be a "helper" for Adam (Genesis 2:18–20).
God has established several types of authority in the world: governments to enforce justice in society and provide protection; pastors to lead and feed the sheep of God; husbands to love and nurture their wives; and fathers to admonish their children.
In each case, submission is required: citizen to government, flock to shepherd, wife to husband, child to father.
The Greek word translated “submit,” hupotasso, is the continuing form of the verb.
This means that submitting to God, the government, a pastor, or a husband is not a one-time act.
It is a continual attitude, which becomes a pattern of behavior.
First, of course, we are responsible to submit to God, which is the only way we can truly obey Him (James 1:21; 4:7).
And each Christian should live in humble, ready submission to others (Ephesians 5:21).
In regards to submission within the family unit, 1 Corinthians 11:2–3, says that the husband is to submit to Christ (as Christ did to God the Father) and the wife is to submit to her husband.
There is much misunderstanding in our world today about the roles of husband and wife within a marriage.
Even when the biblical roles are properly understood, many choose to reject them in favor of a supposed “emancipation” of women, with the result that the family unit is torn apart.
It’s no surprise that the world rejects God’s design, but God’s people should be joyfully celebrating that design.
Submit is not a bad word.
Submission is not a reflection of inferiority or lesser worth.
Christ constantly submitted Himself to the will of the Father (Luke 22:42; John 5:30), without giving up an iota of His worth.
Submission should be a natural response to loving leadership.
When a husband loves his wife as Christ loves the church (Ephesians 5:25—33), then submission is a natural response from a wife to her husband.
But, regardless of the husband’s love or lack thereof, the wife is commanded to submit “as to the Lord” (verse 22).
This means that her obedience to God—her acceptance of His plan—will result in her submission to her husband.
The “as to the Lord” comparison also reminds the wife that there is a higher authority to whom she is responsible.
Thus, she is under no obligation to disobey civil law or God’s law in the name of “submission” to her husband.
She submits in things that are right and lawful and God-honoring.
Of course, she does not “submit” to abuse—that is not right or lawful or God-honoring.
To try to use the principle of “submission” to justify abuse is to twist Scripture and promote evil.
When a wife is loved by her husband as the church is loved by Christ, submission is not difficult.
Ephesians 5:24 says, “Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.” In a marriage, submission is a position of giving honor and respect to the husband (see Ephesians 5:33) and completing what he is lacking in.
It is God’s wise plan for how the family should function.
Commentator Matthew Henry wrote, “The woman was made out of Adam’s side.
She was not made out of his head to rule over him, nor out of his feet to be trampled upon by him, but out of his side to be equal with him, under his arm to be protected, and near his heart to be loved.” The immediate context of the commands to the husband and wife in Ephesians 5:19–33 involves the filling of the Spirit.
Spirit-filled believers are to be worshipful (5:19), thankful (5:20), and submissive (5:21).
Paul then follows this line of thought on Spirit-filled living and applies it to wives in verses 22–24.
A wife should submit to her husband, not because women are inferior (the Bible never teaches that), but because that is how God designed the marital relationship to function.

Often, this question is posed as “Can you prove God exists?” The problem is that, while truth itself is absolute, there are virtually zero instances of absolute proof outside of pure logic and mathematics.
Bolstering faith are human experience, logic, and empirical evidence, all of which help answer the question does God exist?
Our experiences are not conclusive evidence, of course.
Logic points to God: the uncreated, eternal measure of all other things, the First Cause of our reality.
Afterwards, we can use logic to assess those views.
 Does God Exist?
Those who ignore or disdain God’s invitation don’t have the excuse of ignorance (Romans 1:18; Psalm 14:1).
The overwhelming majority of people throughout history have been inclined to believe in a reality greater than the physical.

 Does God Exist?
So, looking at the existence of God ought to start with experiences.
The largest galactic configurations, our solar system, our DNA, subatomic particles—everything gives the appearance of having been purposefully arranged.
The weight of this evidence, logically, favors the idea of an Intelligent Designer—God—as an explanation.
Our universe, clearly, is not eternal or uncaused.
Dozens of universal constants coordinate with mind-boggling precision just to make life possible, let alone actual.
Meanwhile, human DNA represents a coding structure beyond the ability of the best human engineers.
Evidence of God exists in daily human experiences (Romans 1:19–20; Psalm 19:1; Ecclesiastes 3:11).
Meanwhile, human DNA represents a coding structure beyond the ability of the best human engineers.
The cosmological argument considers the principle of cause and effect.

Logic demands something eternally existent and that is not itself the effect of anything else.
Each effect is the result of some cause, and each cause is the effect of a prior cause.
That means a certain amount of “faith” is necessary—and not just regarding God’s existence.
 Demanding “proof” of God that no one could ever reject is unreasonable.
Beyond that, the fundamental content of human morals remains constant throughout history and across cultures.
This includes our innate sense of morality.
Either moral ideas are completely subjective, and therefore meaningless, or they must be grounded in some unchanging standard.

 Discussing the existence of God usually starts with logical arguments.
The question does God exist?, therefore, cannot be answered with absolute proof, but we can point to the weight of evidence that suggests He does exist.
Logic demands something eternally existent and that is not itself the effect of anything else.
Archaeology also lends support to the Bible.
This trait is so strong that even hardened atheists have difficulty explaining away the appearance of design.
Our experiences are not conclusive evidence, of course.
Evidence of God exists in daily human experiences (Romans 1:19–20; Psalm 19:1; Ecclesiastes 3:11).
Accepting the existence of God is not a blind-faith leap into the dark.

 John 9:31 declares, “We know that God does not listen to sinners.
He listens to the godly man who does his will.” It has also been said that “the only prayer that God hears from a sinner is the prayer for salvation.” As a result, some believe that God does not hear and/or will never answer the prayers of an unbeliever.
In context, though, John 9:31 is saying that God does not perform miracles through an unbeliever.
First John 5:14-15 tells us that God answers prayers based on whether they are asked according to His will.
This principle, perhaps, applies to unbelievers.
If an unbeliever asks a prayer of God that is according to His will, nothing prevents God from answering such a prayer—according to His will.
Some Scriptures describe God hearing and answering the prayers of unbelievers.
In most of these cases, prayer was involved.
In one or two, God responded to the cry of the heart (it is not stated whether that cry was directed toward God).
In some of these cases, the prayer seems to be combined with repentance.
But in other cases, the prayer was simply for an earthly need or blessing, and God responded either out of compassion or in response to the genuine seeking or the faith of the person.
Here are some passages dealing with prayer by an unbeliever:
 The people of Nineveh prayed that Nineveh might be spared (Jonah 3:5-10).
God answered this prayer and did not destroy the city of Nineveh as He had threatened.
Hagar asked God to protect her son Ishmael (Genesis 21:14-19).
God not only protected Ishmael, God blessed him exceedingly.
In 1 Kings 21:17-29, especially verses 27-29, Ahab fasts and mourns over Elijah’s prophecy concerning his posterity.
God responds by not bringing about the calamity in Ahab’s time.
The Gentile woman from the Tyre and Sidon area prayed that Jesus would deliver her daughter from a demon (Mark 7:24-30).
Jesus cast the demon out of the woman’s daughter.
Cornelius, the Roman centurion in Acts 10, had the apostle Peter sent to him in response to Cornelius being a righteous man.
Acts 10:2 tells us that Cornelius “prayed to God regularly.” 
 God does make promises that are applicable to all (saved and unsaved alike) such as Jeremiah 29:13: “You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.” This was the case for Cornelius in Acts 10:1-6.
But there are many promises that, according to the context of the passages, are for Christians alone.
Because Christians have received Jesus as the Savior, they are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace to find help in time of need (Hebrews 4:14-16).
We are told that when we ask for anything according to God’s will, He hears and gives us what we ask for (1 John 5:14-15).
There are many other promises for Christians concerning prayer (Matthew 21:22; John 14:13, 15:7).
So, yes, there are instances in which God does not answer the prayers of an unbeliever.
At the same time, in His grace and mercy, God can intervene in the lives of unbelievers in response to their prayers.

 There is a sense in which God loves everyone in the whole world (John 3:16; 1 John 2:2; Romans 5:8).
This love is not conditional—it is rooted in God’s character and based on the fact that He is a God of love (1 John 4:8, 16).
 There is a sense in which God loves everyone in the whole world (John 3:16; 1 John 2:2; Romans 5:8).

God’s unconditional love is related to His general call to salvation and what is often called His permissive or perfect will—that aspect of God’s will that reveals His attitude and defines what is pleasing to Him.
However, God’s love for everyone does not mean that everyone will be saved (see Matthew 25:46).

If God simply disregarded sin and allowed it to continue to wreak havoc in creation forever, then He would not be love.

Does God love everyone?
Yes, He shows mercy and kindness to all.
Does God love Christians more than He loves non-Christians?
No, not in regards to His merciful love.
Does God love Christians in a different way than He loves non-Christians?
God has a unique relationship with Christians in that only Christians have forgiveness based on God’s eternal grace.

 Can God give visions to people today?
Yes!
 Can God give visions to people today?
Possibly.
Should we expect visions to be an ordinary occurrence?
Does God give visions to people today?
Examples are Joseph, son of Jacob; Joseph, the husband of Mary; Solomon; Isaiah; Ezekiel; Daniel; Peter; and Paul.
The prophet Joel predicted an outpouring of visions, and this was confirmed by the apostle Peter in Acts chapter 2.
Should we expect visions to be an ordinary occurrence?
It is important to note that the difference between a vision and a dream is that a vision is given when a person is awake while a dream is given when a person is asleep.
In many parts of the world, God seems to be using visions and dreams extensively.
In areas where there is little or no gospel message available, and where people do not have Bibles, God is taking His message to people directly through dreams and visions.
This is entirely consistent with the biblical example of visions being frequently used by God to reveal His truth to people in the early days of Christianity.
If God desires to communicate His message to a person, He can use whatever means He finds necessary—a missionary, an angel, a vision, or a dream.
The key truth is that if God were to give a vision, it would agree completely with what He has already revealed in His Word.
There is no limit to what God can do.
At the same time, we must be careful when it comes to visions and the interpretation of visions.
We must keep in mind that the Bible is finished, and it tells us everything we need to know.

 Many people desire miracles from God.
They want God to perform miracles to “prove” Himself to them.
“If only God would perform a miracle, sign, or wonder, then I would believe!” This idea, though, is contradicted by Scripture.
When God performed amazing and powerful miracles for the Israelites, did that cause them to obey Him?
No, the Israelites constantly disobeyed and rebelled against God even though they saw all the miracles.
The same people who saw God part the Red Sea later doubted whether God was able to conquer the inhabitants of the Promised Land.
This truth is explained in Luke 16:19-31.
In the story, a man in hell asks Abraham to send Lazarus back from the dead to warn his brothers.
Abraham informed the man, “If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead” (Luke 16:31).
Jesus performed countless miracles, yet the vast majority of people did not believe in Him.
If God performed miracles today as He did in the past, the result would be the same.
People would be amazed and would believe in God for a short time.
That faith would be shallow and would disappear the moment something unexpected or frightening occurred.
A faith based on miracles is not a mature faith.
God performed the greatest “God miracle” of all time in coming to earth as the Man Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins (Romans 5:8) so that we could be saved (John 3:16).
God does still perform miracles—many of them simply go unnoticed or are denied.
However, we do not need more miracles.
What we need is to believe in the miracle of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
The purpose of miracles was to authenticate the performer of the miracles.
Acts 2:22 declares, “Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.” The same is said of the apostles, “The things that mark an apostle—signs, wonders and miracles—were done among you with great perseverance” (2 Corinthians 12:12).
Speaking of the gospel, Hebrews 2:4 proclaims, “God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.” We now have the truth of Jesus recorded in Scripture.
We now have the writings of the apostles recorded in Scripture.
Jesus and His apostles, as recorded in Scripture, are the cornerstone and foundation of our faith (Ephesians 2:20).
In this sense, miracles are no longer necessary, as the message of Jesus and His apostles has already been attested to and accurately recorded in the Scriptures.
Yes, God still performs miracles.
At the same time, we should not necessarily expect miracles to occur today just as they did in Bible times.

 The Bible records God speaking audibly to people many times (Exodus 3:14; Joshua 1:1; Judges 6:18; 1 Samuel 3:11; 2 Samuel 2:1; Job 40:1; Isaiah 7:3; Jeremiah 1:7; Acts 8:26; 9:15—this is just a small sampling).
There is no biblical reason why God could not speak to a person audibly today.
With the hundreds of times the Bible records God speaking, we have to remember that they occur over the course of 4,000 years of human history.
God speaking audibly is the exception, not the rule.
Even in the biblically recorded instances of God speaking, it is not always clear whether it was an audible voice, an inner voice, or a mental impression.
God does speak to people today.
First, God speaks to us through His Word (2 Timothy 3:16–17).
Isaiah 55:11 tells us, “So is my word that goes out from my mouth: it will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.” The Bible is God’s Word, and it contains everything we need to know in order to be saved and live the Christian life.
Second Peter 1:3 declares, “His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us by his own glory and goodness.”
Second Peter 1:3 declares, “His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us by his own glory and goodness.”
God is in the process of conforming our minds to think His thoughts (Romans 12:2).
And God helps us to discern right from wrong through our consciences (1 Timothy 1:5; 1 Peter 3:16).
God is in the process of conforming our minds to think His thoughts (Romans 12:2).
 God can also “speak” to us through events—i.e., He can guide us through arranging our circumstances.
First Peter 1:6–7 reminds us, “In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
These have come so that your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.”
If anyone claims that God has spoken to him or her, always compare what is said with what the Bible says.
It is highly doubtful, though, that this occurs as often as some people claim it does.
Again, even in the Bible, God speaking audibly is the exception, not the ordinary.
If anyone claims that God has spoken to him or her, always compare what is said with what the Bible says.
If anyone claims that God has spoken to him or her, always compare what is said with what the Bible says.

 There is a tendency to look at slavery as something of the past.
But it is estimated that there are today over 27 million people in the world who are subject to slavery: forced labor, sex trade, inheritable property, etc.
As those who have been redeemed from the slavery of sin, followers of Jesus Christ should be the foremost champions of ending human slavery in the world today.
The question arises, though, why does the Bible not speak out strongly against slavery?
Why does the Bible, in fact, seem to support the practice of human slavery?
The Bible does not specifically condemn the practice of slavery.
It gives instructions on how slaves should be treated (Deuteronomy 15:12-15; Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 4:1), but does not outlaw slavery altogether.
Many see this as the Bible condoning all forms of slavery.
What many fail to understand is that slavery in biblical times was very different from the slavery that was practiced in the past few centuries in many parts of the world.
The slavery in the Bible was not based exclusively on race.
People were not enslaved because of their nationality or the color of their skin.
In Bible times, slavery was based more on economics; it was a matter of social status.
People sold themselves as slaves when they could not pay their debts or provide for their families.
In New Testament times, sometimes doctors, lawyers, and even politicians were slaves of someone else.
Some people actually chose to be slaves so as to have all their needs provided for by their masters.
The slavery of the past few centuries was often based exclusively on skin color.
In the United States, many black people were considered slaves because of their nationality; many slave owners truly believed black people to be inferior human beings.
The Bible condemns race-based slavery in that it teaches that all men are created by God and made in His image (Genesis 1:27).
At the same time, the Old Testament did allow for economic-based slavery and regulated it.
The key issue is that the slavery the Bible allowed for in no way resembled the racial slavery that plagued our world in the past few centuries.
In addition, both the Old and New Testaments condemn the practice of “man-stealing,” which is what happened in Africa in the 16th to 19th centuries.
Africans were rounded up by slave-hunters, who sold them to slave-traders, who brought them to the New World to work on plantations and farms.
This practice is abhorrent to God.
In fact, the penalty for such a crime in the Mosaic Law was death: “Anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be put to death” (Exodus 21:16).
Similarly, in the New Testament, slave-traders are listed among those who are “ungodly and sinful” and are in the same category as those who kill their fathers or mothers, murderers, adulterers and perverts, and liars and perjurers (1 Timothy 1:8– 10).
Another crucial point is that the purpose of the Bible is to point the way to salvation, not to reform society.
The Bible often approaches issues from the inside out.
If a person experiences the love, mercy, and grace of God by receiving His salvation, God will reform his soul, changing the way he thinks and acts.
A person who has experienced God’s gift of salvation and freedom from the slavery of sin, as God reforms his soul, will realize that enslaving another human being is wrong.
He will see, with Paul, that a slave can be “a brother in the Lord” (Philemon 1:16).
A person who has truly experienced God’s grace will in turn be gracious towards others.
That would be the Bible’s prescription for ending slavery.

 If we read the Bible at face value, without a preconceived bias for finding errors, we will find it to be a coherent, consistent, and relatively easy-to-understand book.
Yes, there are difficult passages.
Yes, there are verses that appear to contradict each other.
We must remember that the Bible was written by approximately 40 different authors over a period of around 1,500 years.
Each writer wrote with a different style, from a different perspective, to a different audience, for a different purpose.
We should expect some minor differences.
However, a difference is not a contradiction.
It is only an error if there is absolutely no conceivable way the verses or passages can be reconciled.
Even if an answer is not available right now, that does not mean an answer does not exist.
Many have found a supposed error in the Bible in relation to history or geography only to find out that the Bible is correct once further archaeological evidence is discovered.
We often receive questions along the lines of “Explain how these verses do not contradict!” or “Look, here is an error in the Bible!” Admittedly, some of the things people bring up are difficult to answer.
We often receive questions along the lines of “Explain how these verses do not contradict!” or “Look, here is an error in the Bible!” Admittedly, some of the things people bring up are difficult to answer.
However, it is our contention that there are viable and intellectually plausible answers to every supposed Bible contradiction and error.
There are books and websites available that list “all the errors in the Bible.” Most people simply get their ammunition from these places; they do not find supposed errors on their own.
Many “Bible attackers” are even aware of these answers, but they continue to use the same old shallow attacks again and again.
The saddest thing is that most people who attack the Bible are not truly interested in an answer.
There are also books and websites available that refute every one of these supposed errors.
The saddest thing is that most people who attack the Bible are not truly interested in an answer.
Many “Bible attackers” are even aware of these answers, but they continue to use the same old shallow attacks again and again.
So, what are we to do when someone approaches us with an alleged Bible error?
1) Prayerfully study the Scriptures and see if there is a simple solution.
2) Do some research using some of the fine Bible commentaries, “Bible defense” books, and biblical research websites.
3) Ask our pastors/church leaders to see if they can find a solution.
4) If there is still no clear answer after steps 1), 2), and 3) are followed, we trust God that His Word is truth and that there is a solution that just simply has not been realized yet (2 Timothy 2:15, 3:16-17).

 The only apostle whose death the Bible records is James (Acts 12:2).
King Herod had James “put to death with the sword,” likely a reference to beheading.
The circumstances of the deaths of the other apostles are related through church tradition, so we should not put too much weight on any of the other accounts.
The most commonly accepted church tradition in regard to the death of an apostle is that the apostle Peter was crucified upside-down in Rome in fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy (John 21:18).
                                                                                         Answer
He died as an old man, the only apostle to die peacefully.
  Matthew suffered martyrdom in Ethiopia, killed by a sword wound.
John faced martyrdom when he was boiled in a huge basin of boiling oil during a wave of persecution in Rome.
However, he was miraculously delivered from death.
John faced martyrdom when he was boiled in a huge basin of boiling oil during a wave of persecution in Rome.
The apostle John was later freed and returned to what is now modern-day Turkey.
James, the brother of Jesus (not officially an apostle), was the leader of the church in Jerusalem.
He was thrown from the southeast pinnacle of the temple (over a hundred feet down) when he refused to deny his faith in Christ.
When they discovered that he survived the fall, his enemies beat James to death with a club.
This is thought to be the same pinnacle where Satan had taken Jesus during the temptation.
Bartholomew, also known as Nathanael, was a missionary to Asia.
He witnessed in present-day Turkey and was martyred for his preaching in Armenia, being flayed to death by a whip.
Andrew was crucified on an x-shaped cross in Greece.
After seven soldiers whipped Andrew severely, they tied his body to the cross with cords to prolong his agony.

Matthias, the apostle chosen to replace the traitor Judas Iscariot, was stoned and then beheaded.
The apostle Paul was tortured and then beheaded by the evil Emperor Nero in Rome in AD 67.
There are traditions regarding the other apostles as well, but none with any reliable historical or traditional support.
It is not so important how the apostles died.
What is important is the fact that they were all willing to die for their faith.
If Jesus had not been resurrected, the disciples would have known it.
People will not die for something they know to be a lie.
The fact that all of the apostles were willing to die horrible deaths, refusing to renounce their faith in Christ, is tremendous evidence that they had truly witnessed the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

 The Bible does not give any explicit teaching on whether pets/animals have “souls” or whether pets/animals will be in heaven.
However, we can use general biblical principles to develop some clarity on the subject.
The Bible states that both man (Genesis 2:7) and animals (Genesis 1:30; 6:17; 7:15, 22) have the “breath of life”; that is, both man and animals are living beings.
The primary difference between human beings and animals is that humanity is made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27), while animals are not.
Being made in the image and likeness of God means that human beings are like God, capable of spirituality, with mind, emotion, and will, and they have a part of their being that continues after death.
If pets/animals do have a “soul” or immaterial aspect, it must therefore be of a different and lesser “quality.” This difference possibly means that pet/animal “souls” do not continue in existence after death.
If pets/animals do have a “soul” or immaterial aspect, it must therefore be of a different and lesser “quality.” This difference possibly means that pet/animal “souls” do not continue in existence after death.
Another factor to consider regarding whether pets will be heaven is that animals are a part of God’s creative process in Genesis.
The primary difference between human beings and animals is that humanity is made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27), while animals are not.
Therefore, there is no reason why there could not be pets / animals on the new earth (Revelation 21:1).
There will most definitely be animals during the millennial kingdom (Isaiah 11:6; 65:25).
It is impossible to say definitively whether some of these animals might be the pets we had while here on earth.
We do know that God is just and that when we get to heaven we will find ourselves in complete agreement with His decision on this issue, whatever it may be.

 When people come to know Christ as their Savior, they are brought into a relationship with God that guarantees their eternal security.
Jude 24 declares, "To Him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before His glorious presence without fault and with great joy."
It is up to Him, not us, to present us before His glorious presence.
Our eternal security is a result of God keeping us, not us maintaining our own salvation.
The Lord Jesus Christ proclaimed, "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand" (John 10:28-29b).
Both Jesus and the Father have us firmly grasped in their hand.
Who could possibly separate us from the grip of both the Father and the Son?
Ephesians 4:30 tells us that believers are "sealed for the day of redemption."
If believers did not have eternal security, the sealing could not truly be unto the day of redemption, but only to the day of sinning, apostasy, or disbelief.
John 3:15-16 tells us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ will "have eternal life."
If a person were to be promised eternal life, but then have it taken away, it was never "eternal" to begin with.
If eternal security is not true, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in error.
The most powerful argument for eternal security is Romans 8:38-39, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

Our eternal security is purchased by Christ, promised by the Father, and sealed by the Holy Spirit.

 Face it.
The day we step into eternity may come sooner than we think.
In preparation for that moment, we need to know this truth—not everyone is going to heaven.
How can we know for sure that we are going to heaven?
Some 2,000 years ago, the apostles Peter and John were preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to a large crowd in Jerusalem.
Peter made a profound statement that resonates even in our postmodern world: “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).
Now as then, Acts 4:12 is not politically correct.
Today it’s popular to say, “Everyone’s going to heaven” or “All paths lead to heaven.” There are many who think they can have heaven without having Jesus.
They want the glory, but they don’t want to be bothered by the cross, much less the One who died there.
Many don’t want to accept Jesus as the only way of going to heaven and are determined to find another path.
But Jesus warns us that no other path exists and that the consequence for rejecting this truth is an eternity in hell.
He told us that “whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on him” (John 3:36).
Faith in Christ is the key to going to heaven.
Some will argue that it’s extremely narrow-minded of God to provide only one way to heaven.
But, frankly, in light of mankind’s rebellion against God, it’s extremely broad-minded for Him to provide us with any way to heaven.
We deserve judgment, but God gives us the way of escape by sending His one-and-only Son to die for our sins.
Whether someone sees this as narrow or broad, it’s the truth.
The good news is that Jesus died and rose again; those who are going to heaven have received this gospel by faith.
Many people today hold to a watered-down gospel that does away with the need for repentance.
They want to believe in a “loving” (nonjudgmental) God who never mentions sin and who requires no change in their lifestyle.
They may say things like, “My God would never send a person to hell.” But Jesus spoke more about hell than He did about heaven, and He presented Himself as the Savior who offers the only means of going to heaven: “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
Who will actually enter God’s kingdom?
How can I guarantee that I’m going to heaven?
The Bible makes a clear distinction between those who have eternal life and those who do not: “He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life” (1 John 5:12).
It all goes back to faith.
Those who believe in Christ are made the children of God (John 1:12).
Those who accept Jesus’ sacrifice as the payment for their sins and who believe in His resurrection are going to heaven.
Those who reject Christ are not.
“Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son” (John 3:18).
Faith in Jesus is the one means of going to heaven.
Those who have faith are guaranteed to get there.

                                                                                         Answer
 The Bible presents a clear path to eternal life.
First, we must recognize that we have sinned against God: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
We have all done things that are displeasing to God, which makes us deserving of punishment.
Since all our sins are ultimately against an eternal God, only an eternal punishment is sufficient.
"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
However, Jesus Christ, the sinless (1 Peter 2:22), eternal Son of God became a man (John 1:1,14) and died to pay our penalty.
"God demonstrates His love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).
Jesus Christ died on the cross (John 19:31-42), taking the punishment that we deserve (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Three days later He rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4), proving His victory over sin and death.
"In His great mercy He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" (1 Peter 1:3).
By faith, we must change our mindset regarding Christ - who He is, what He did, and why - for salvation (Acts 3:19).&nbsp;If we place our faith in Him, trusting His death on the cross to pay for our sins, we will be forgiven and receive the promise of eternal life in heaven.
"For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son so that anyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).
"If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9).
Faith alone in the finished work of Christ on the cross is the only true path to eternal life!
"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, here is a sample prayer.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and deserve punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"

 Acts 13:38 declares, "Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
What is forgiveness and why do I need it?
 The word "forgive" means to wipe the slate clean, to pardon, to cancel a debt.
When we wrong someone, we seek their forgiveness in order for the relationship to be restored.
Forgiveness is not granted because a person deserves to be forgiven.
No one deserves to be forgiven.
Forgiveness is an act of love, mercy, and grace.
Forgiveness is a decision to not hold something against another person, despite what they have done to you.
The Bible tells us that we are all in need of forgiveness from God.
We have all committed sin.
First John 1:8 says, "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."
All sin is ultimately an act of rebellion against God (Psalm 51:4).
As a result, we desperately need God’s forgiveness.
If our sins are not forgiven, we will spend eternity suffering the consequences of our sins (Matthew 25:46; John 3:36).
Forgiveness – How do I get it?
 Thankfully, God is loving and merciful – eager to forgive us of our sins!
2 Peter 3:9 tells us, "…He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."
The only just penalty for our sins is death.
The first half of Romans 6:23 declares, "For the wages of sin is death…" Eternal death is what we have earned for our sins.
God, in His perfect plan, became a human being – Jesus Christ (John 1:1,14).
Jesus died on the cross, taking the punishment that we deserve!
Second Corinthians 5:21 teaches us, "God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God."
As God, Jesus’ death provided forgiveness for the sins of the entire world.
1 John 2:2 proclaims, "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."
Praise God, through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the second half of Romans 6:23 is true, "…but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Do you want to have your sins forgiven?
Do you have a nagging feeling of guilt that you can’t seem to get to go away?
Forgiveness of your sins is available if you will place your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.
Ephesians 1:7 says, "In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace."
All you have to do is ask God to forgive you through Jesus, believing that Jesus died to pay for your forgiveness – and He will forgive you!
John 3:16-17 contains this wonderful message, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him."
Forgiveness – is it really that easy?
 Yes it is that easy!
You can’t earn forgiveness from God.
You can’t pay for your forgiveness from God.
You can only receive it, by faith, through the grace and mercy of God.
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and receive forgiveness from God, here is a prayer you can pray.
Saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness!
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness!
Amen!"

 The Bible tells us that no one has ever seen God (John 1:18) except the Lord Jesus Christ.
 The Bible tells us that no one has ever seen God (John 1:18) except the Lord Jesus Christ.
In Exodus 33:20, God declares, “You cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.” These Scriptures seem to contradict other Scriptures which describe various people “seeing” God.
In this instance, the phrase “face to face” is a figure of speech indicating they were in very close communion.
In Genesis 32:30, Jacob saw God appearing as a man; he did not truly see God.
God and Moses were speaking to each other as if they were two human beings having a close conversation.
Samson’s parents were terrified when they realized they had seen God (Judges 13:22), but they had only seen Him appearing as an angel.
Samson’s parents were terrified when they realized they had seen God (Judges 13:22), but they had only seen Him appearing as an angel.
So, yes, God can be “seen” and many people have “seen” God.
At the same time, no one has ever seen God revealed in all His glory.

 The term “canon” is used to describe the books that are divinely inspired and therefore belong in the Bible.
The difficulty in determining the biblical canon is that the Bible does not give us a list of the books that belong in the Bible.
Determining the canon was a process conducted first by Jewish rabbis and scholars and later by early Christians.
It was simply a matter of God’s convincing His human followers which books should be included in the Bible.
The difficulty in determining the biblical canon is that the Bible does not give us a list of the books that belong in the Bible.
It was simply a matter of God’s convincing His human followers which books should be included in the Bible.
Compared to the New Testament, there was much less controversy over the canon of the Old Testament.
Hebrew believers recognized God’s messengers and accepted their writings as inspired of God.
While there was undeniably some debate in regards to the Old Testament canon, by A.D. 250 there was nearly universal agreement on the canon of Hebrew Scripture.
The only issue that remained was the Apocrypha, with some debate and discussion continuing today.
The vast majority of Hebrew scholars considered the Apocrypha to be good historical and religious documents, but not on the same level as the Hebrew Scriptures.
For the New Testament, the process of the recognition and collection began in the first centuries of the Christian church.
Very early on, some of the New Testament books were being recognized.
Paul considered Luke’s writings to be as authoritative as the Old Testament (1 Timothy 5:18; see also Deuteronomy 25:4 and Luke 10:7).
Peter recognized Paul’s writings as Scripture (2 Peter 3:15-16).
Very early on, some of the New Testament books were being recognized.
Some of the books of the New Testament were being circulated among the churches (Colossians 4:16; 1 Thessalonians 5:27).
Clement of Rome mentioned at least eight New Testament books (A.D. 95).
Ignatius of Antioch acknowledged about seven books (A.D. 115).
Polycarp, a disciple of John the apostle, acknowledged 15 books (A.D. 108).
Later, Irenaeus mentioned 21 books (A.D. 185).
Hippolytus recognized 22 books (A.D. 170-235).
The New Testament books receiving the most controversy were Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, and 3 John.
The first “canon” was the Muratorian Canon, which was compiled in AD 170.
The Muratorian Canon included all of the New Testament books except Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, and 3 John.
In AD 363, the Council of Laodicea stated that only the Old Testament (along with one book of the Apocrypha) and 26 books of the New Testament (everything but Revelation) were canonical and to be read in the churches.
The Council of Hippo (AD 393) and the Council of Carthage (AD 397) also affirmed the same 27 books as authoritative.
The councils followed something similar to the following principles to determine whether a New Testament book was truly inspired by the Holy Spirit: 1) Was the author an apostle or have a close connection with an apostle?
2) Is the book being accepted by the body of Christ at large?
3) Did the book contain consistency of doctrine and orthodox teaching?
4) Did the book bear evidence of high moral and spiritual values that would reflect a work of the Holy Spirit?
Again, it is crucial to remember that the church did not determine the canon.
No early church council decided on the canon.
It was God, and God alone, who determined which books belonged in the Bible.
It was simply a matter of God’s imparting to His followers what He had already decided.
The human process of collecting the books of the Bible was flawed, but God, in His sovereignty, and despite our ignorance and stubbornness, brought the early church to the recognition of the books He had inspired.

 Becoming a child of God requires faith in Jesus Christ.
“To all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).
“You must be born again”
 When visited by the religious leader Nicodemus, Jesus did not immediately assure him of heaven.
Instead, Christ told him he had to become a child of God, saying, “I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again” (John 3:3).
The first time a person is born, he inherits the sin nature that stems from Adam’s disobedience in the Garden of Eden.
No one has to teach a child how to sin.
He naturally follows his own wrong desires, leading to such sins as lying, stealing, and hating.
Rather than being a child of God, he is a child of disobedience and wrath (Ephesians 2:1–3).
As children of wrath, we deserve to be separated from God in hell.
Thankfully, Ephesians 2:4–5 says, “But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.” How are we made alive with Christ / born again / made a child of God?
We must receive Jesus by faith!
Receive Jesus
 “To all who have received him—those who believe in his name—he has given the right to become God’s children” (John 1:12, NET).
This verse clearly explains how to become a child of God.
We must receive Jesus by believing in Him.
What must we believe about Jesus?
First, the child of God recognizes that Jesus is the eternal Son of God who became man.
Born of a virgin through the power of the Holy Spirit, Jesus did not inherit Adam’s sin nature.
Therefore, Jesus is called the second Adam (1 Corinthians 15:22).
While Adam’s disobedience brought the curse of sin on the world, Christ’s perfect obedience brings a blessing.
Our response must be to repent (turn from sin) and seek forgiveness in Christ.
Second, the child of God has faith in Jesus as Savior.
God’s plan was to sacrifice His perfect Son on the cross to pay the punishment we deserve for our sin: death.
Christ’s death frees those who receive Him from the penalty and power of sin.
His resurrection justifies us (Romans 4:25).
Finally, the child of God follows Jesus as Lord.
After raising up Christ as the Victor over sin and death, God gave Him all authority (Ephesians 1:20–23).
Jesus leads all who receive Him; He will judge all who reject Him (Acts 10:42).
By God’s grace, we’re born again to new life as God’s child.
Only those who receive Jesus—not merely knowing about Him but relying on Him for salvation, submitting to Him as Master, and loving Him as the supreme treasure—become children of God.
Become a child of God
 Just as we had no part in our natural birth, we cannot cause ourselves to be born into God’s family by doing good deeds or conjuring up faith of our own.
God is the one who “gave the right” to become a child of God according to His gracious will.
“How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!” (1 John 3:1).
Thus, the child of God has nothing to be proud about; his only boast is in the Lord (Ephesians 2:8–9).
A child grows up to look like his parents.
Similarly, God wants His children to become more and more like Jesus Christ.
Although only in heaven will we be perfect, a child of God will not habitually, unrepentantly sin.
“Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray.
He who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.
He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.
The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work.
No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.
This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother” (1 John 3:7–10).
Make no mistake—a child of God cannot be “disowned” by sinning.
But someone who consistently engages in and enjoys sin without heeding Christ and His Word reveals that he was never born again.
Jesus told such people, “You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desire” (John 8:44).
The child of God, on the other hand, no longer craves the gratification of sin but desires to know, love, and glorify his or her Father.
What does it mean to be a child of God?
 What does it mean that we are children of God (1 John 3:2)?

                                                                                         Answer
 The first step to become a Christian is to understand what the term “Christian” means.
The origin of the term “Christian” was in the city of Antioch in the first century A.D. (see Acts 11:26).
It is possible that, at first, the term “Christian” was intended to be an insult.
The word essentially means “little Christ.” However, over the centuries, believers in Christ have adopted the term “Christian” and use it to identify themselves as followers of Jesus Christ.
A simple definition of a Christian is a person who follows Jesus Christ.
Why should I become a Christian?
 Jesus Christ declared that He “did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45).
The question then arises – why did we need to be ransomed?
The idea of a ransom is a payment that must be made in exchange for the release of a person.
The idea of a ransom is most frequently used in instances of kidnapping, when someone is kidnapped and held prisoner until a ransom is paid for the person’s release.
Jesus paid our ransom to free us from bondage!
Bondage from what?
Bondage to sin and its consequences, physical death followed by eternal separation from God.
Why did Jesus need to pay this ransom?
Because we are all infected with sin (Romans 3:23), and are therefore worthy of judgment from God (Romans 6:23).
How did Jesus pay our ransom?
By dying on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
How could Jesus’ death sufficiently pay for all of our sins?
Jesus was God in human form, God come to earth to become one of us so He could identify with us and die for our sins (John 1:1,14).
As God, Jesus’ death was infinite in value, sufficient to pay for the sins of the entire world (1 John 2:2).
Jesus’ resurrection after His death demonstrated that His death was the sufficient sacrifice, that He had truly conquered sin and death.
How can I become a Christian?
 This is the best part.
Because of His love for us, God has made it exceedingly simple to become a Christian.
All you have to do is receive Jesus as your Savior, fully accepting His death as the sufficient sacrifice for your sins (John 3:16), fully trusting Him alone as your Savior (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).
Becoming a Christian is not all about rituals, going to church, or doing certain things while refraining from other things.
Becoming a Christian is all about having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
A personal relationship with Jesus Christ, through faith, is what makes a person a Christian.
Are you ready to become a Christian?

 An important verse in understanding the filling of the Holy Spirit is John 14:16, where Jesus promised the Spirit would indwell believers and that the indwelling would be permanent.
It is important to distinguish the indwelling from the filling of the Spirit.
The permanent indwelling of the Spirit is not for a select few believers, but for all believers.
There are a number of references in Scripture that support this conclusion.
First, the Holy Spirit is a gift given to all believers in Jesus without exception, and no conditions are placed upon this gift except faith in Christ (John 7:37-39).
Romans 8:9 and Ephesians 1:13-14 states that He dwells within every believer, but He can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30), and His activity within us can be quenched (1 Thessalonians 5:19).
Galatians 3:2 emphasizes this same truth, saying that the sealing and indwelling of the Spirit took place at the time of believing.
Third, the Holy Spirit indwells believers permanently.
The Holy Spirit is given to believers as a down payment, or verification of their future glorification in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:22; Ephesians 4:30).
This is in contrast to the filling of the Spirit referred to in Ephesians 5:18.
We should be so completely yielded to the Holy Spirit that He can possess us fully and, in that sense, fill us.
Romans 8:9 and Ephesians 1:13-14 states that He dwells within every believer, but He can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30), and His activity within us can be quenched (1 Thessalonians 5:19).
When we allow this to happen, we do not experience the fullness of the Spirit’s working and His power in and through us.
To be filled with the Spirit implies freedom for Him to occupy every part of our lives, guiding and controlling us.
Only our obedience to God’s commands allows the Spirit freedom to work within us.
The filling of the Spirit does not apply to outward acts alone; it also applies to the innermost thoughts and motives of our actions.
Psalm 19:14 says, "May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer."
Sin is what hinders the filling of the Holy Spirit, and obedience to God is how the filling of the Spirit is maintained.
Ephesians 5:18 commands that we be filled with the Spirit; however, it is not praying for the filling of the Holy Spirit that accomplishes the filling.
Only our obedience to God’s commands allows the Spirit freedom to work within us.
Because we are still infected with sin, it is impossible to be filled with the Spirit all of the time.
When we sin, we should immediately confess it to God and renew our commitment to being Spirit-filled and Spirit-led.

 This simple, yet profound, question is the most important question that can be asked.
"How can I be saved?
" deals with where we will spend eternity after our lives in this world are over.
There is no more important issue than our eternal destiny.
Thankfully, the Bible is abundantly clear on how a person can be saved.
The Philippian jailer asked Paul and Silas, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30).
Paul and Silas responded, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved” (Acts 16:31).
We are all infected with sin (Romans 3:23).
We are born with sin (Psalm 51:5), and we all personally choose to sin (Ecclesiastes 7:20; 1 John 1:8).
Sin is what makes us unsaved.
Sin is what separates us from God.
Sin is what has us on the path to eternal destruction.
Because of our sin, we all deserve death (Romans 6:23).
While the physical consequence of sin is physical death, that is not the only kind of death that results from sin.
All sin is ultimately committed against an eternal and infinite God (Psalm 51:4).
Because of that, the just penalty for our sin is also eternal and infinite.
What we need to be saved from is eternal destruction (Matthew 25:46; Revelation 20:15).
Because the just penalty for sin is infinite and eternal, only God could pay the penalty, because only He is infinite and eternal.
But God, in His divine nature, could not die.
So God became a human being in the person of Jesus Christ.
God took on human flesh, lived among us, and taught us.
When the people rejected Him and His message, and sought to kill Him, He willingly sacrificed Himself for us, allowing Himself to be crucified (John 10:15).
Because Jesus Christ was human, He could die; and because Jesus Christ was God, His death had an eternal and infinite value.
Jesus’ death on the cross was the perfect and complete payment for our sin (1 John 2:2).
He took the consequences we deserved.
Jesus’ resurrection from the dead demonstrated that His death was indeed the perfectly sufficient sacrifice for sin.
“Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved” (Acts 16:31).
God has already done all of the work.
All you must do is receive, in faith, the salvation God offers (Ephesians 2:8-9).
Fully trust in Jesus alone as the payment for your sins.
Believe in Him, and you will not perish (John 3:16).
God is offering you salvation as a gift.
All you have to do is accept it.
Jesus is the way of salvation (John 14:6).

 Questions about Salvation
                                                                                         Answer
 At some point, every Christian has had a family member, a friend, co-worker, or acquaintance who is not a Christian.
Sharing the gospel with others can be difficult, and it can become even more difficult when it involves someone with whom we have close emotional ties.
The Bible tells us that some people will be offended at the gospel (Luke 12:51–53).
However, we are commanded to share the gospel, and there is no excuse for not doing so (Matthew 28:19–20; Acts 1:8; 1 Peter 3:15).
So, how can we evangelize our family members, friends, co-workers, and acquaintances?
The most important thing we can do is pray for them.
Pray for wisdom as to how to best minister to them (James 1:5).
In addition to praying and sharing our faith, we must also live godly Christian lives in front of our friends and family members so they can see the change God has made in us (1 Peter 3:1–2).
The Bible tells us that some people will be offended at the gospel (Luke 12:51–53).
There is no substitute for personally sharing the gospel: “Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ” (Romans 10:17).
We must be willing and bold in our actual sharing of the gospel.
Proclaim the message of salvation through Jesus Christ to your friends and family (Romans 10:9–10).
Always be prepared to speak of your faith (1 Peter 3:15), doing so with gentleness and respect.
Ultimately, we must leave the salvation of our loved ones up to God.
It is God’s power and grace that saves people, not our efforts.
The best we can do is pray for them, witness to them, and live the Christian life in front of them.

How can you have assurance of salvation?
Consider 1 John 5:11–13: “And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
Consider 1 John 5:11–13: “And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
If you have Jesus, you have life.
God wants us to have assurance of our salvation.
We should not live our Christian lives wondering and worrying each day whether we are truly saved.
That is why the Bible makes the plan of salvation so clear.
Believe in Jesus Christ (John 3:16; Acts 16:31).
Do you believe that Jesus died to pay the penalty for your sins and rose again from the dead (John 3:16; Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21)?
Do you trust Him alone for salvation?
If your answer to these questions is “yes,” you are saved!
By taking God’s Word to heart, you can have no doubt about the reality of your eternal salvation.
Jesus Himself assures those who believe in Him: “I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand” (John 10:28–29).
Not temporary life, but eternal.
There is no one, not even yourself, who can take Christ’s God-given gift of salvation away from you.
Consider 1 John 5:11–13: “And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
By taking God’s Word to heart, you can have no doubt about the reality of your eternal salvation.
We can have the assurance from Christ’s own Word that our salvation will never be in question.
Our assurance of salvation is based on the perfect and complete salvation God has provided for us through Jesus Christ.

 Many people believe answered prayer is God granting a prayer request that is offered to Him.
If a prayer request is not granted, it is understood as an “unanswered” prayer.
However, this is an incorrect understanding of prayer.
God answers every prayer that is lifted to Him.
Sometimes God answers “no” or “wait.” God only promises to grant our prayers when we ask according to His will.
“This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
“This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him” (1 John 5:14-15).
What does it mean to pray according to God’s will?
Praying according to God’s will is praying for things that honor and glorify God and/or praying for what the Bible clearly reveals God’s will to be.
If we pray for something that is not honoring to God or not God’s will for our lives, God will not give what we ask for.
How can we know what God’s will is?
God promises to give us wisdom when we ask for it.
James 1:5 proclaims, “If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.” A good place to start is 1 Thessalonians 5:12-24, which outlines many things that are God’s will for us.

The better we understand God’s Word, the better we will know what to pray for (John 15:7).
The better we know what to pray for, the more often God will answer “yes” to our requests.

 Do you know for certain that you have eternal life and that you will go to heaven when you die?
God wants you to be sure!
The Bible says: “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (1 John 5:13).
Suppose you were standing before God right now and He asked you, “Why should I let you into heaven?” What would you say?
                                                                                         Answer
What you need to know is that God loves us and has provided a way that we can know for sure where we will spend eternity.
The Bible states it this way: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
The Bible states it this way: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
We have to first understand the problem that is keeping us from heaven.
The problem is this - our sinful nature keeps us from having a relationship with God.
We are sinners by nature and by choice.
“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).
We cannot save ourselves.
Not by works, so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9).
“For the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).
God is holy and just and must punish sin, yet He loves us and has provided forgiveness for our sin.
No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
Jesus died for us on the cross: “For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous to bring you to God” (1 Peter 3:18).
Jesus was resurrected from the dead: “He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification” (Romans 4:25).
So, back to the original question – “How can I know for sure that I will go to heaven when I die?” The answer is this – believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved (Acts 16:31).
“To all who received Him, to those who believed in His Name, He gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).
You can receive eternal life as a FREE gift.
“The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).
You can live a full and meaningful life right now.
Jesus said: “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
You can spend eternity with Jesus in heaven, for He promised: “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you may also be where I am” (John 14:3).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and receive forgiveness from God, here is prayer you can pray.
It is only trusting in Jesus Christ that can provide forgiveness of sins.
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and receive forgiveness from God, here is prayer you can pray.
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.&nbsp;But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
It is only trusting in Jesus Christ that can provide forgiveness of sins.
What is the prayer of salvation?
I place my trust in You for salvation.&nbsp;Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness!&nbsp;Amen!"

As we seek God’s will, we should make sure what we are considering is not something the Bible forbids.
Also, we should make sure what we are considering will glorify God and help us and others grow spiritually.
As we seek God’s will, we should make sure what we are considering is not something the Bible forbids.
Knowing God’s will is sometimes difficult because it requires patience.
Knowing God’s will is sometimes difficult because it requires patience.
Often, we want God to give us specifics—where to work, where to live, whom to marry, what car to buy, etc.
In fact, He has already given us many, many directions in His Word.
As we seek God’s will, we should make sure what we are considering is not something the Bible forbids.
Romans 12:2 says, “Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
At its most basic, the will of God is to repent of our sin and trust in Christ.
God is not trying to hide His will from us; He wants to reveal it.
As we seek God’s will, we should make sure what we are considering is not something the Bible forbids.
 It is important to know God’s will.
If we are walking closely with the Lord and truly desiring His will for our lives, God will place His desires in our hearts.
The key is wanting God’s will, not our own.
“Delight yourself in the LORD and He will give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4).
As we walk with the Lord, obeying His Word and relying on His Spirit, we find that we are given the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16).
If we are walking closely with the Lord and truly desiring His will for our lives, God will place His desires in our hearts.

 Love is a very powerful emotion.
It motivates much of our lives.
We make many important decisions based on this emotion, and even get married because we feel that we are “in love.” This may be the reason about half of all first marriages end in divorce.
The Bible teaches us that true love is not an emotion that can come or go, but a decision.
We are not just to love those who love us; we should even love those who hate us, the same way that Christ loves the unlovable (Luke 6:35).
                                                                                         Answer
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres” (1 Corinthians 13:4-7).
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres” (1 Corinthians 13:4-7).
It can be very easy to “fall in love” with someone, but there are some questions to ask before deciding if what we are feeling is true love.
First, is this person a Christian, meaning has he given his life to Christ?
Is he/she trusting Christ alone for salvation?

The Bible tells us that when two people get married, they become one flesh (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5).
The Bible tells us that when two people get married, they become one flesh (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5).
Another thing to consider is whether or not the loved one is a good candidate for being a mate.
Has he/she already put God first and foremost in his/her life?
Is he/she able to give his/her time and energy to building the relationship into a marriage that will last a lifetime?
There is no measuring stick to determine when we are truly in love with someone, but it is important to discern whether we are following our emotions or following God’s will for our lives.
True love is a decision, not just an emotion.
True biblical love is loving someone all of the time, not just when you feel “in love.”

 Not going to hell is easier than you think.
Some people believe they have to obey the Ten Commandments for their entire lives to not go to hell.
Some people believe they must observe certain rites and rituals in order to not go to hell.
Some people believe there is no way we can know for sure whether or not we will go to hell.
None of these views are correct.
The Bible is very clear on how a person can avoid going to hell after death.
The Bible describes hell as a terrifying and horrible place.
Hell is described as “eternal fire” (Matthew 25:41), “unquenchable fire” (Matthew 3:12), “shame and everlasting contempt” (Daniel 12:2), a place where “the fire is not quenched” (Mark 9:44-49), and “everlasting destruction” (2 Thessalonians 1:9).
Revelation 20:10 describes hell as a “lake of burning sulfur” where the wicked are “tormented day and night forever and ever.” Obviously, hell is a place we should avoid.
Why does hell even exist, and why does God send some people there?
The Bible tells us that God “prepared” hell for the devil and the fallen angels after they rebelled against Him (Matthew 25:41).
Those who refuse God’s offer of forgiveness will suffer the same eternal destiny of the devil and the fallen angels.
Why is hell necessary?
All sin is ultimately against God (Psalm 51:4), and since God is an infinite and eternal being, only an infinite and eternal penalty is sufficient.
Hell is the place where God’s holy and righteous demands of justice are carried out.
Hell is where God condemns sin and all those who reject Him.
The Bible makes it clear that we have all sinned (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:10-23), so, as a result, we all deserve to go to hell.
So, how can we not go to hell?
Since only an infinite and eternal penalty is sufficient, an infinite and eternal price must be paid.
God became a human being in the Person of Jesus Christ (John 1:1, 14).
In Jesus Christ, God lived among us, taught us, and healed us—but those things were not His ultimate mission.
God became a human being so that He could die for us.
Jesus, God in human form, died on the cross.
As God, His death was infinite and eternal in value, paying the full price for sin (1 John 2:2).
God invites us to receive Jesus Christ as Savior, accepting His death as the full and just payment for our sins.
God promises that anyone who believes in Jesus (John 3:16), trusting Him alone as the Savior (John 14:6), will be saved, i.e., not go to hell.
God does not want anyone to go to hell (2 Peter 3:9).
That is why God made the ultimate, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice on our behalf.
If you want to not go to hell, receive Jesus as your Savior.
It is as simple as that.
Tell God that you recognize that you are a sinner and that you deserve to go to hell.
Declare to God that you are trusting in Jesus Christ as your Savior.
Thank God for providing for your salvation and deliverance from hell.
Simple faith, trusting in Jesus Christ as the Savior, is how you can avoid going to hell!

 The Bible presents several different resources to aid us in our effort to overcome sin.
In this lifetime, we will never be perfectly victorious over sin (1 John 1:8), but that should still be our goal.
With God’s help, and by following the principles of His Word, we can progressively overcome sin and become more and more like Christ.
The first resource the Bible mentions in our effort to overcome sin is the Holy Spirit.
God has given us the Holy Spirit so we can be victorious in Christian living.
God contrasts the deeds of the flesh with the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:16-25.
In that passage we are called upon to walk in the Spirit.
All believers already possess the Holy Spirit, but this passage tells us that we need to walk in the Spirit, yielding to His control.
This means choosing to consistently follow the Holy Spirit’s prompting in our lives rather than following the flesh.
The difference the Holy Spirit can make is demonstrated in the life of Peter, who, before being filled with the Holy Spirit, denied Jesus three times—and this after he had said he would follow Christ to the death.
After being filled with the Spirit, he spoke openly and strongly to the Jews at Pentecost.
We walk in the Spirit as we try not to quench the Spirit’s promptings (as spoken of in 1 Thessalonians 5:19) and seek instead to be filled with the Spirit—that is, to be fully under the Spirit’s control (Ephesians 5:18–21).
How is one filled with the Holy Spirit?

Hebrews 4:12 tells us that the Word of God is living and powerful, able to penetrate to our hearts to root out and overcome the deepest sins of heart and attitude.
This gives the Spirit freedom to work within our thoughts and actions.
The Word of God, the Bible, says that God has given us His Word to equip us for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
It teaches us how to live and what to believe, it reveals to us when we have chosen wrong paths, it helps us get back on the right path, and it helps us to stay on that path.
Hebrews 4:12 tells us that the Word of God is living and powerful, able to penetrate to our hearts to root out and overcome the deepest sins of heart and attitude.
The psalmist talks about its life-changing power in-depth in Psalm 119.
Joshua was told that the key to success in overcoming his enemies was not to forget this resource but instead to meditate on it day and night and obey it.
This he did, even when what God commanded did not make sense militarily, and this was the key to his victory in his battles for the Promised Land.
The Bible is a resource that we too often treat lightly.
We give token service to it by carrying our Bibles to church or reading a daily devotional or a chapter a day, but we fail to memorize it, meditate on it, or apply it to our lives; we fail to confess the sins it reveals or praise God for the gifts it reveals to us.
When it comes to the Bible, we are often either anorexic or bulimic.
We either take in just enough to keep us alive spiritually by eating from the Word (but never ingesting enough to be healthy, thriving Christians), or we come to feed often but never meditate on it long enough to get spiritual nutrition from it.
It is important, if you have not made a habit of daily studying and memorizing God’s Word, that you begin to do so.
Paul repeatedly mentions how he prayed for those he ministered to.
Paul repeatedly mentions how he prayed for those he ministered to.
The Bible is the tool the Spirit uses in our lives (Ephesians 6:17), an essential and major part of the armor that God gives us to fight our spiritual battles (Ephesians 6:12-18).
A third crucial resource in our battle against sin is prayer.
Again, it is a resource that Christians often give lip service to but make poor use of.
Paul repeatedly mentions how he prayed for those he ministered to.
A third crucial resource in our battle against sin is prayer.
Paul repeatedly mentions how he prayed for those he ministered to.
God has given us wonderful promises concerning prayer (Matthew 7:7-11; Luke 18:1-8; John 6:23-27; 1 John 5:14-15), and Paul includes prayer in his passage on preparing for spiritual battle (Ephesians 6:18).
How important is prayer to overcoming sin in our lives?
We have Christ’s words to Peter in the Garden of Gethsemane, just before Peter’s denial.
Jesus wakes him and says, “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.
The spirit is willing, but the body is weak” (Matthew 26:41).
We, like Peter, want to do what is right but are not finding the strength.
We need to follow God’s admonition to keep seeking, keep knocking, keep asking—and He will give us the strength that we need (Matthew 7:7).
Prayer is not a magic formula.
Prayer is simply acknowledging our own limitations and God’s inexhaustible power and turning to Him for that strength to do what He wants us to do, not what we want to do (1 John 5:14-15).
A fourth resource in our war to conquer sin is the church, the fellowship of other believers.
When Jesus sent His disciples out, He sent them out two-by-two (Mark 6:7).
The missionaries in Acts did not go out one at a time, but in groups of two or more.
The Bible commands us not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together but to use that time for encouraging one another in love and good works (Hebrews 10:24).
It tells us to confess our faults to one another (James 5:16).
In the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, we are told that as iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another (Proverbs 27:17).
Prayer is not a magic formula.
Many Christians find that having an accountability partner can be a huge benefit in overcoming stubborn sins.
Having another person who can talk with you, pray with you, encourage you, and even rebuke you is of great value.
Temptation is common to us all (1 Corinthians 10:13).
Having an accountability partner or an accountability group can give us the final dose of encouragement and motivation we need to overcome even the most stubborn of sins.
Sometimes victory over sin comes quickly.
Other times, victory comes more slowly.
God has promised that as we make use of His resources, He will progressively bring about change in our lives.
We can persevere in our efforts to overcome sin because we know that He is faithful to His promises.

 Preparing oneself for marriage biblically is the same as preparing for any life endeavor.
There is a principle that should govern all aspects of our lives as born-again believers: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind” (Matthew 22:37).
There is a principle that should govern all aspects of our lives as born-again believers: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind” (Matthew 22:37).
This is not a flippant command.
It is the centerpiece of our lives as believers.
It is choosing to focus upon God and upon His Word with our whole heart so that our soul and our mind are occupied with the things that will please Him.
The relationship we have with God through the Lord Jesus Christ is what puts all other relationships into perspective.
The marriage relationship is based upon the model of Christ and His church (Ephesians 5:22-33).
The marriage relationship is based upon the model of Christ and His church (Ephesians 5:22-33).
Every aspect of our lives is governed by our commitment as believers to live according to the commandments and precepts of the Lord.
Our obedience to God and to His Word equips us to fulfill our God-given roles in marriage and in the world.
And the role of every born-again believer is to glorify God in all things (1 Corinthians 10:31).
In order to prepare yourself for marriage, to walk worthy of your calling in Christ Jesus, and to become intimate with God through His Word (2 Timothy 3:16-17), focus upon obedience in all things.
Walking worthy of Christ is to submit ourselves in humility to the only Way, the only Truth and the only Life on a day-by-day, moment-by-moment basis.
It is a choice we must make every day to put aside worldly viewpoints and follow God instead.
A person who is spiritually mature and walking with God is more prepared for marriage than anyone else.
That is the preparation every believer needs to be ready for the great gift we call marriage.
Marriage demands commitment, passion, humility, love, and respect.
If you submit yourself to Him, He will enable you to be ready for marriage when that wonderful day arrives.
As you prepare yourself for marriage, focus on allowing God to shape you and mold you into the man or woman He wants you to be (Romans 12:1-2).

 This question has been asked by countless people throughout the ages.
Samuel heard the voice of God, but did not recognize it until he was instructed by Eli (1 Samuel 3:1–10).
Gideon had a physical revelation from God, and he still doubted what he had heard to the point of asking for a sign, not once, but three times (Judges 6:17–22,36–40).
When we are listening for God’s voice, how can we know that He is the one speaking?
First of all, we have something that Gideon and Samuel did not.
We have the complete Bible, the inspired Word of God, to read, study, and meditate on.
“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16–17).
Samuel heard the voice of God, but did not recognize it until he was instructed by Eli (1 Samuel 3:1–10).
When we have a question about a certain topic or decision in our lives, we should see what the Bible has to say about it.
We hear His voice when we spend time in Bible study and quiet contemplation of His Word.
To hear God’s voice we must belong to God.
Jesus said, “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27).
If we are to recognize God’s voice, we must belong to Him.
These are the sheep who hear and recognize His voice, because they know Him as their Shepherd.
If we are to recognize God’s voice, we must belong to Him.
We hear His voice when we spend time in Bible study and quiet contemplation of His Word.
The more time we spend intimately with God and His Word, the easier it is to recognize His voice and His leading in our lives.
Employees at a bank are trained to recognize counterfeits by studying genuine money so closely that it is easy to spot a fake.
We should be so familiar with God’s Word that when someone speaks error to us, it is clear that it is not of God.
While God could speak audibly to people today, He speaks primarily through His written Word.
Sometimes God’s leading can come through the Holy Spirit, through our consciences, through circumstances, and through the exhortations of other people.
By comparing what we hear to the truth of Scripture, we can learn to recognize God’s voice.

 It is impossible for us to fully understand the relationship between God’s sovereignty and man’s free will and responsibility.
Only God truly knows how they work together in His plan of salvation.
With this doctrine, probably more so than with any other, it is crucially important to admit our inability to fully grasp the nature of God and our relationship with Him.
Going too far to either side results in a distorted understanding of salvation.
The fact that believers are predestined (Romans 8:29-30; Ephesians 1:5, 11) and elected for salvation (Romans 9:11, 11:28; 2 Peter 1:10) is clear.
Ephesians 1:4 tells us that God chose us “before the creation of the world.” The Bible repeatedly describes believers as the “chosen” (Romans 8:33, 11:5; Ephesians 1:11; Colossians 3:12; 1 Thessalonians 1:4; 1 Peter 1:2, 2:9) and the “elect” (Matthew 24:22, 31; Mark 13:20, 27; Romans 11:7; 1 Timothy 5:21; 2 Timothy 2:10; Titus 1:1; 1 Peter 1:1).
The fact that believers are predestined (Romans 8:29-30; Ephesians 1:5, 11) and elected for salvation (Romans 9:11, 11:28; 2 Peter 1:10) is clear.
The fact that believers are predestined (Romans 8:29-30; Ephesians 1:5, 11) and elected for salvation (Romans 9:11, 11:28; 2 Peter 1:10) is clear.
The Bible also says that we are responsible for receiving Christ as Savior.
God knows who will be saved and God chooses who will be saved, and we must choose Christ in order to be saved.
How these facts work together is impossible for a finite mind to comprehend (Romans 11:33-36).
Our responsibility is to take the gospel to the world (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8).
We should leave foreknowledge, election, and predestination up to God and simply be obedient in sharing the gospel.

 A man in the Greek city of Philippi asked a very similar question of Paul and Silas.
We know at least three things about this man: he was a jailer, he was a pagan, and he was desperate.
He had been on the verge of suicide when Paul stopped him.
And that’s when the man asked, “What must I do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30).
The very fact that the man asks the question shows that he recognized his need of salvation—he saw only death for himself, and he knew he needed help.
The fact that he asks Paul and Silas shows that he believed they had the answer.
That answer comes swiftly and simply: “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved” (verse 31).
The passage goes on to show how the man did believe and was converted.
His life began displaying the difference from that day forward.
Note that the man’s conversion was based on faith (“Believe”).
He had to trust Jesus and nothing else.
The man believed that Jesus was the Son of God (“Lord”) and the Messiah who fulfilled the scriptures (“Christ”).
His faith also included a belief that Jesus died for sin and rose again, because that was the message that Paul and Silas were preaching (see Romans 10:9-10 and 1 Corinthians 15:1-4).
To “convert” is literally “to turn.” When we turn towards one thing, we by necessity turn away from something else.
When we turn to Jesus, a turning from sin is implied.
The Bible describes “repentance” as a change of mind about sin and a change of mind about Jesus, and then a turning to Jesus in “faith.” Therefore, repentance and faith are complementary.
Both repentance and faith are indicated in 1 Thessalonians 1:9—“You turned to God from idols.” A Christian will leave behind his former ways and anything pertaining to false religion as the result of a genuine conversion to Christianity.
To put it simply, to convert to Christianity, you must believe that Jesus is the Son of God who died for your sin and rose again.
You must agree with God that you are a sinner in need of salvation, and you must trust in Jesus alone to save you.
When you do this, God promises to save you and give you the Holy Spirit, who will make you a new creature.
Christianity, in its true form, is not a religion.
Christianity, according to the Bible, is a relationship with Jesus Christ.
Christianity is God offering salvation to anyone who believes and trusts the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.
A person who converts to Christianity is not leaving one religion for another religion.
Converting to Christianity is receiving the gift that God offers and beginning a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that results in the forgiveness of sins and eternity in Heaven after death.

 In order to get “right” with God, we must first understand what is “wrong.” The answer is sin.
                                                                                         Answer
“There is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 14:3).
“The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4).
The bad news is that the penalty for sin is death.
“The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4).
The good news is that a loving God has pursued us in order to bring us salvation.
Jesus declared His purpose was “to seek and to save what was lost” (Luke 19:10), and He pronounced His purpose accomplished when He died on the cross with the words, “It is finished!” (John 19:30).
Having a right relationship with God begins with acknowledging your sin.
Next comes a humble confession of your sin to God (Isaiah 57:15).
“For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved” (Romans 10:10).
This repentance must be accompanied by faith – specifically, faith that Jesus’ sacrificial death and miraculous resurrection qualify Him to be your Savior.
“If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9).
Many other passages speak of the necessity of faith, such as John 20:27; Acts 16:31; Galatians 2:16; 3:11, 26; and Ephesians 2:8.
Being right with God is a matter of your response to what God has done on your behalf.
He sent the Savior, He provided the sacrifice to take away your sin (John 1:29), and He offers you the promise: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Acts 2:21).
He sent the Savior, He provided the sacrifice to take away your sin (John 1:29), and He offers you the promise: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Acts 2:21).
A beautiful illustration of repentance and forgiveness is the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32).
The younger son wasted his father’s gift in shameful sin (verse 13).
When he acknowledged his wrongdoing, he decided to return home (verse 18).
He assumed he would no longer be considered a son (verse 19), but he was wrong.
He assumed he would no longer be considered a son (verse 19), but he was wrong.
“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18).
All was forgiven, and a celebration ensued (verse 24).
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18).
If you want to get right with God, here is a sample prayer.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness – the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"

 There is no magic formula or definitive test that can tell us exactly what our spiritual gifts are.
He will equip us with whatever gift or gifts we need to accomplish the task He has called us to.
A common problem for Christians is the temptation to get so caught up in our spiritual gift that we only seek to serve God in the area in which we feel we have been gifted.
He will equip us with whatever gift or gifts we need to accomplish the task He has called us to.
He will equip us with whatever gift or gifts we need to accomplish the task He has called us to.
Identifying our spiritual giftedness can be accomplished in various ways.
Spiritual gift tests or inventories, while not to be fully relied upon, can definitely help us understand where our gifting might be.
Confirmation from others also gives light to our spiritual giftedness.
Other people who see us serving the Lord can often identify a spiritual gift in us that we might take for granted or not recognize.
Prayer is also important.
The one person who knows exactly how we are spiritually gifted is the gift-giver Himself—the Holy Spirit.
We can ask God to show us how we are gifted in order to better use our spiritual gifts for His glory.
Yes, God calls some to be teachers and gives them the gift of teaching.
Yes, God calls some to be teachers and gives them the gift of teaching.
However, specifically knowing our spiritual gift does not excuse us from serving God in areas outside our gifting.
Is it beneficial to know what spiritual gift(s) God has given us?
Of course it is.
Is it wrong to focus so much on spiritual gifts that we miss other opportunities to serve God?
Yes.
If we are dedicated to being used by God, He will equip us with the spiritual gifts we need.

 How to best discipline children can be a difficult task to learn, but it is crucially important.
Some claim that physical discipline (corporal punishment) such as spanking is the only method the Bible supports.
Others insist that “time-outs” and other punishments that do not involve physical discipline are far more effective.
The Bible teaches that physical discipline is appropriate, beneficial, and necessary.
A child should never be disciplined physically to the extent that it causes actual physical damage.
According to the Bible, though, the appropriate and restrained physical discipline of children is a good thing and contributes to the well-being and correct upbringing of the child.
Many Scriptures do in fact promote physical discipline.
The book of Proverbs contains plentiful wisdom regarding the rearing of children, such as, “The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself disgraces his mother” (Proverbs 29:15).
Physical discipline may well save them from death” (Proverbs 23:13-14; see also 13:24; 22:15; 20:30).
The Bible strongly stresses the importance of discipline; it is something we must all have in order to be productive people, and it is much more easily learned when we are young.
Children who are not disciplined often grow up rebellious, have no respect for authority, and as a result find it difficult to willingly obey and follow God.
Discipline is used to correct and train people to go in the right way.
                                                                                         Answer
God Himself uses discipline to correct us and lead us down the right path and to encourage repentance for our wrong actions (Psalm 94:12; Proverbs 1:7; 6:23; 12:1; 13:1; 15:5; Isaiah 38:16; Hebrews 12:9).
God Himself uses discipline to correct us and lead us down the right path and to encourage repentance for our wrong actions (Psalm 94:12; Proverbs 1:7; 6:23; 12:1; 13:1; 15:5; Isaiah 38:16; Hebrews 12:9).
Physical discipline may well save them from death” (Proverbs 23:13-14; see also 13:24; 22:15; 20:30).

Physical discipline may well save them from death” (Proverbs 23:13-14; see also 13:24; 22:15; 20:30).
This verse outlines the consequences of not disciplining a child—the parents are disgraced.
Discipline is used to correct and train people to go in the right way.
Of course, discipline must have as its goal the good of the child and must never be used to justify the abuse and mistreatment of children.
Discipline is used to correct and train people to go in the right way.
The book of Proverbs contains plentiful wisdom regarding the rearing of children, such as, “The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself disgraces his mother” (Proverbs 29:15).
Physical discipline should never be used to cause lasting physical harm or pain.
These moments are the perfect time to teach a child that God disciplines us because He loves us and that, as parents, we do the same for our children.
Can other forms of discipline, such as “time-outs,” be used instead of physical discipline?
Some parents find that “time-outs,” grounding, and/or taking something away from the children is more effective in encouraging behavioral change.
If that is indeed the case, by all means, a parent should employ the methods that best produce the needed behavioral change.
While the Bible undeniably advocates physical discipline, the Bible is more concerned with the goal of building godly character than it is in the precise method used to produce that goal.
Many parents do not spank their children for fear of being reported to the government and risk having their children taken away.
A government should never contradict God’s Word, and physical discipline is, biblically speaking, in the best interest of children.
However, keeping children in families in which they will at least receive some discipline is far better than losing children to the “care” of the government.
In Ephesians 6:4, fathers are told not to exasperate their children.
Raising a child in the “training and instruction of the Lord” includes restrained, corrective, and, yes, loving physical discipline.

 Since the fall of man, the basis of salvation has always been the death of Christ.
No one, either prior to the cross or since the cross, would ever be saved without that one pivotal event in the history of the world.
Christ’s death paid the penalty for past sins of Old Testament saints and future sins of New Testament saints.
The requirement for salvation has always been faith.
The object of one’s faith for salvation has always been God.
The psalmist wrote, “Blessed are all who take refuge in him” (Psalm 2:12).
The psalmist wrote, “Blessed are all who take refuge in him” (Psalm 2:12).
Genesis 15:6 tells us that Abraham believed God and that was enough for God to credit it to him for righteousness (see also Romans 4:3-8).
The Old Testament sacrificial system did not take away sin, as Hebrews 10:1-10 clearly teaches.
It did, however, point to the day when the Son of God would shed His blood for the sinful human race.
What has changed through the ages is the content of a believer’s faith.
God’s requirement of what must be believed is based on the amount of revelation He has given mankind up to that time.
This is called progressive revelation.
Adam believed the promise God gave in Genesis 3:15 that the Seed of the woman would conquer Satan.
Adam believed Him, demonstrated by the name he gave Eve (v. 20) and the Lord indicated His acceptance immediately by covering them with coats of skin (v. 21).
Adam believed Him, demonstrated by the name he gave Eve (v. 20) and the Lord indicated His acceptance immediately by covering them with coats of skin (v. 21).
At that point that is all Adam knew, but he believed it.
At that point that is all Adam knew, but he believed it.
Abraham believed God according to the promises and new revelation God gave him in Genesis 12 and 15.
Throughout the Old Testament, believers came to salvation because they believed that God would someday take care of their sin problem.
Throughout the Old Testament, believers came to salvation because they believed that God would someday take care of their sin problem.
Today, we look back, believing that He has already taken care of our sins on the cross (John 3:16; Hebrews 9:28).
What about believers in Christ’s day, prior to the cross and resurrection?
What did they believe?
Did they understand the full picture of Christ dying on a cross for their sins?
Late in His ministry, “Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life” (Matthew 16:21-22).
What was the reaction of His disciples to this message?
“Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
‘Never, Lord!’ he said.
‘This shall never happen to you!’” Peter and the other disciples did not know the full truth, yet they were saved because they believed that God would take care of their sin problem.
They didn’t exactly know how He would accomplish that, any more than Adam, Abraham, Moses, or David knew how, but they believed God.
Today, we have more revelation than the people living before the resurrection of Christ; we know the full picture.
“In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe” (Hebrews 1:1-2).
 What happens to those who have never heard about Jesus?
Today, for us, the content of our faith is that Jesus Christ died for our sins, He was buried, and He rose the third day (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).
 How does God judge those who were raised in non-Christian cultures and have been taught their entire life that their own religion is correct, and Christianity is wrong?

 We often receive questions like “I am divorced for such and such a reason.
Can I get remarried?” “I have been divorced twice—the first for adultery by my spouse, the second for incompatibility.
I am dating a man who has been divorced three times—the first for incompatibility, the second for adultery on his part, the third for adultery on his wife’s part.
Can we get married to each other?” Questions like these are very difficult to answer because the Bible does not go into great detail regarding the various scenarios for remarriage after a divorce.
What we can know for sure is that it is God’s plan for a married couple to stay married as long as both spouses are alive (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:6).
The only specific allowance for remarriage after a divorce is for adultery (Matthew 19:9), and even this is debated among Christians.
Another possibility is desertion—when an unbelieving spouse leaves a believing spouse (1 Corinthians 7:12–15).
This passage, though, does not specifically address remarriage, only being bound to stay in a marriage.
Instances of physical, sexual, or severe emotional abuse would be sufficient cause for separation, but the Bible does not speak of these sins in the context of divorce or remarriage.
We know two things for sure.
God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16), and God is merciful and forgiving.
Every divorce is a result of sin, either on the part of one spouse or both.
Does God forgive divorce?
Absolutely!
Divorce is no less forgivable than any other sin.
Forgiveness of all sins is available through faith in Jesus Christ (Matthew 26:28; Ephesians 1:7).
If God forgives the sin of divorce, does that mean you are free to remarry?
Not necessarily.
God sometimes calls people to remain single (1 Corinthians 7:7-8).
Being single should not be viewed as a curse or punishment, but as an opportunity to serve God wholeheartedly (1 Corinthians 7:32-36).
God’s Word does tell us, though, that it is better to marry than to burn with passion (1 Corinthians 7:9).
Perhaps this sometimes applies to remarriage after a divorce.
So, can you or should you get remarried?
We cannot answer that question.
Ultimately, that is between you, your potential spouse, and, most importantly, God.
The only advice we can give is for you to pray to God for wisdom regarding what He would have you do (James 1:5).
Pray with an open mind and genuinely ask the Lord to place His desires on your heart (Psalm 37:4).
Seek the Lord’s will (Proverbs 3:5-6) and follow His leading.

 To understand Jesus as God on earth praying to His Father in heaven, we need to realize that the eternal Father and the eternal Son had an eternal relationship before Jesus took upon Himself the form of a man.
Please read John 5:19-27, particularly verse 23 where Jesus teaches that the Father sent the Son (also see John 15:10).
Jesus did not become the Son of God when He was born in Bethlehem.
He has always been the Son of God from eternity past, still is the Son of God, and always will be.
Isaiah 9:6 tells us that the Son was given and the Child was born.
Jesus was always part of the tri-unity, along with the Holy Spirit.
The tri-unity always existed, the Father God, the Son God, and the Spirit God, not three gods, but one God existing as three persons.
Jesus taught that He and His Father are one (John 10:30), meaning that He and His Father are of the same substance and the same essence.
The Father, Son and Spirit are three co-equal persons existing as God.
These three had, and continue to have, an eternal relationship.
When Jesus, the eternal Son of God, took upon Himself sinless humanity He also took on the form of a servant, giving up His heavenly glory (Philippians 2:5-11).
As the God-man, He had to learn obedience (Hebrews 5:8) to His Father as He was tempted by Satan, accused falsely by men, rejected by His people, and eventually crucified.
His praying to His heavenly Father was to ask for power (John 11:41-42) and wisdom (Mark 1:35, 6:46).
His praying showed His dependence upon His Father in His humanity to carry out His Father’s plan of redemption, as evidenced in Christ’s high priestly prayer in John 17.
His praying demonstrated that He ultimately submitted to His Father’s will, which was to go to the cross and pay the penalty (death) for our breaking God’s law (Matthew 26:31-46).
Of course, He rose bodily from the grave, winning forgiveness and eternal life for those who repent of sin and believe in Him as the Savior.
There is no problem with God the Son praying or talking to God the Father.
As mentioned, they had an eternal relationship before Christ became a man.
This relationship is depicted in the Gospels so we can see how the Son of God in His humanity carried out His Father’s will, and in doing so, purchased redemption for His children (John 6:38).
Christ’s continual submission to His heavenly Father was empowered and kept focused through His prayer life.
Christ’s example of prayer is ours to follow.
Jesus Christ was no less God on earth when praying to His Father in heaven.
He was depicting how even in sinless humanity it is necessary to have a vital prayer life in order to do His Father’s will.
Jesus’ praying to the Father was a demonstration of His relationship within the Trinity and an example for us that we must rely on God through prayer for the strength and wisdom we need.
Since Christ, as the God-man, needed to have a vibrant prayer life, so should the follower of Christ today.

 Questions about Jesus Christ
                                                                                         Answer
 Congratulations!
You have made a life-changing decision!
Perhaps you are asking, “Now what?
How do I begin my journey with God?” The five steps mentioned below will give you direction from the Bible.
When you have questions on your journey, please visit www.GotQuestions.org.
1.
Make sure you understand salvation.
 First John 5:13 tells us, “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.” God wants us to understand salvation.
God wants us to have the confidence of knowing for sure that we are saved.
Briefly, let’s go over the key points of salvation:
 (a) We have all sinned.
We have all done things that are displeasing to God (Romans 3:23).
(b) Because of our sin, we deserve to be punished with eternal separation from God (Romans 6:23).
(c) Jesus died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins (Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus died in our place, taking the punishment that we deserved.
Jesus’ resurrection proved that His death was sufficient to pay for our sins.
(d) God grants forgiveness and salvation to all those who place their faith in Jesus—trusting His death as the payment for our sins (John 3:16; Romans 5:1; Romans 8:1).
(e) The Holy Spirit comes to reside permanently within us at the moment of faith.
He assures us of everlasting life.
He teaches us God’s Word and empowers us to live according to it.
That is the message of salvation!
If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior, you are saved!
All of your sins are forgiven, and God promises to never leave you or forsake you (Romans 8:38–39; Matthew 28:20).
Remember, your salvation is secure in Jesus Christ (John 10:28–29).
If you are trusting in Jesus alone as your Savior, you can have confidence that you will spend eternity with God in heaven!
2.
Find a good church that teaches the Bible.
 Don’t think of the church as a building.
The church is the  people.
It is very important that believers in Jesus Christ fellowship with one another.
That is one of the primary purposes of the church.
Now that you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ, we strongly encourage you to find a Bible-believing church in your area and speak to the pastor.
Let him know about your new faith in Jesus Christ.
A second purpose of the church is to teach the Bible.
You can learn how to apply God’s instructions to your life.
Understanding the Bible is key to living a successful and powerful Christian life.
2 Timothy 3:16-17 says, “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”
 A third purpose of the church is worship.
Worship is thanking God for all He has done!
God has saved us.
God loves us.
God provides for us.
God guides and directs us.
How could we not thank Him?
God is holy, righteous, loving, merciful, and full of grace.
Revelation 4:11 declares, “You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.”
 3.
Set aside time each day to focus on God.
 It is very important for us to spend time each day focusing  on God.
Some people call this a “quiet time.” Others call it  “devotions,” because it is a time when we devote ourselves to God.
Some prefer to set aside time in the mornings, while others prefer the evenings.
It does not matter what you call this time or when you do it.
What matters is that you regularly spend time with God.
What events make up our time with God?
(a) Prayer.
Prayer is simply talking to God.
Talk to God about your concerns and problems.
Ask God to give you wisdom and guidance.
Ask God to provide for your needs.
Tell God how much you love Him and how much you appreciate all He does for you.
That is what prayer is all about.
(b) Bible Reading.
In addition to being taught the Bible in church, Sunday School, and/or Bible studies – you need to be reading the Bible for yourself.
The Bible contains everything you need to know in order to live a successful Christian life.
It contains God’s guidance for how to make wise decisions, how to know God’s will, how to minister to others, and how to grow spiritually.
The Bible is God’s Word to us.
The Bible is essentially God’s instruction manual for how to live our lives in a way that is pleasing to Him and satisfying to us.
4.
Develop relationships with people who can help you spiritually.
 1 Corinthians 15:33 tells us, “Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character.’” The Bible is full of warnings about the influence “bad” people can have on us.
Spending time with those who engage in sinful activities will cause us to be tempted by those activities.
The character of those we are around will “rub off” on us.
That is why it is so important to surround ourselves with other people who love the Lord and are committed to Him.
Try to find a friend or two, perhaps from your church, who can help you and encourage you (Hebrews 3:13; 10:24).
Ask your friends to keep you accountable in regard to your quiet time, your activities, and your walk with God.
Ask if you can do the same for them.
This does not mean you have to give up all your friends who do not know the Lord Jesus as their Savior.
Continue to be their friend and love them.
Simply let them know that Jesus has changed your life and you cannot do all the same things you used to do.
Ask God to give you opportunities to share Jesus with your friends.
5.
Be baptized.
 Many people have a misunderstanding of baptism.
The word baptize means “to immerse in water.” Baptism is the biblical way of publicly proclaiming your new faith in Christ and your commitment to follow Him.
The action of being immersed in the water illustrates being buried with Christ.
The action of coming out of the water pictures Christ’s resurrection.
Being baptized is identifying yourself with Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection (Romans 6:3-4).
I am a new Christian.

 Questions about the Christian Life
                                                                                         Answer
 Annihilationism is the belief that unbelievers will not experience an eternity of suffering in hell, but will instead be “extinguished” after death.
For many, annihilationism is an attractive belief because of the awfulness of the idea of people spending eternity in hell.
While there are some passages that seem to argue for annihilationism, a comprehensive look at what the Bible says about the destiny of the wicked reveals the fact that punishment in hell is eternal.
A belief in annihilationism results from a misunderstanding of one or more of the following doctrines: 1) the consequences of sin, 2) the justice of God, 3) the nature of hell.
In relation to the nature of hell, annihilationists misunderstand the meaning of the lake of fire.
Obviously, if a human being were cast into a lake of burning lava, he/she would be almost instantly consumed.
However, the lake of fire is both a physical and spiritual realm.
It is not simply a human body being cast into the lake of fire; it is a human’s body, soul, and spirit.
A spiritual nature cannot be consumed by physical fire.
It seems that the unsaved are resurrected with a body prepared for eternity just as the saved are (Revelation 20:13; Acts 24:15).
These bodies are prepared for an eternal fate.
Eternity is another aspect which annihilationists fail to fully comprehend.
Annihilationists are correct that the Greek word aionion, which is usually translated “eternal,” does not by definition mean “eternal.” It specifically refers to an “age” or “eon,” a specific period of time.
However, it is clear that in the New Testament, aionion is sometimes used to refer to an eternal length of time.
Revelation 20:10 speaks of Satan, the beast, and the false prophet being cast into the lake of fire and being tormented “day and night forever and ever.” It is clear that these three are not “extinguished” by being cast into the lake of fire.
Why would the fate of the unsaved be any different (Revelation 20:14-15)?
The most convincing evidence for the eternality of hell is Matthew 25:46, “Then they [the unsaved] will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.” In this verse, the same Greek word is used to refer to the destiny of the wicked and the righteous.
If the wicked are only tormented for an “age,” then the righteous will only experience life in heaven for an “age.” If believers will be in heaven forever, unbelievers will be in hell forever.
Another frequent objection to the eternality of hell by annihilationists is that it would be unjust for God to punish unbelievers in hell for eternity for a finite amount of sin.
How could it be fair for God to take a person who lived a sinful, 70-year life, and punish him/her for all of eternity?
The answer is that our sin bears an eternal consequence because it is committed against an eternal God.
When King David committed the sins of adultery and murder he stated, “Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight” (Psalm 51:4).
David had sinned against Bathsheba and Uriah; how could David claim to have only sinned against God?
David understood that all sin is ultimately against God.
God is an eternal and infinite Being.
As a result, all sin against Him is worthy of an eternal punishment.
It is not a matter of the length of time we sin, but the character of the God against whom we sin.
A more personal aspect of annihilationism is the idea that we could not possibly be happy in heaven if we knew that some of our loved ones were suffering an eternity of torment in hell.
However, when we arrive in heaven, we will not have anything to complain about or be saddened by.
Revelation 21:4 tells us, “He will wipe every tear from their eyes.
There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” If some of our loved ones are not in heaven, we will be in 100 percent complete agreement that they do not belong there and that they are condemned by their own refusal to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior (John 3:16; 14:6).
It is hard to understand this, but we will not be saddened by the lack of their presence.
Our focus should not be on how we can enjoy heaven without all of our loved ones there, but on how we can point our loved ones to faith in Christ so that they will be there.
Hell is perhaps a primary reason why God sent Jesus Christ to pay the penalty for our sins.
Being “extinguished” after death is no fate to dread, but an eternity in hell most definitely is.
Jesus’ death was an infinite death, paying our infinite sin debt so that we would not have to pay it in hell for eternity (2 Corinthians 5:21).
When we place our faith in Him, we are saved, forgiven, cleansed, and promised an eternal home in heaven.
But if we reject God’s gift of eternal life, we will face the eternal consequences of that decision.

 Questions about False Doctrine
                                                                                         Answer
 Corporate prayer is an important part of the life of the church, along with worship, sound doctrine, communion, and fellowship.
The early church met regularly to learn the doctrine of the apostles, break bread, and pray together (Acts 2:42).
When we pray together with other believers, the effects can be very positive.
Corporate prayer edifies and unifies us as we share our common faith.
The same Holy Spirit who dwells within each believer causes our hearts to rejoice as we hear praises to our Lord and Savior, knitting us together in a unique bond of fellowship found nowhere else in life.
To those who may be alone and struggling with life’s burdens, hearing others lift them up to the throne of grace can be a great encouragement.
It also builds in us love and concern for others as we intercede for them.
At the same time, corporate prayer will only be a reflection of the hearts of the individuals who participate.
We are to come to God in humility (James 4:10), truth (Psalm 145:18), obedience (1 John 3:21-22), with thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6) and confidence (Hebrews 4:16).
Sadly, corporate prayer can also become a platform for those whose words are directed not to God, but to their hearers.
Jesus warned against such behavior in Matthew 6:5-8 where He exhorts us not to be showy, long-winded, or hypocritical in our prayers, but to pray secretly in our own rooms in order to avoid the temptation of using prayer hypocritically.
There is nothing in Scripture to suggest that corporate prayers are “more powerful” than individual prayers in the sense of moving the hand of God.
Far too many Christians equate prayer with “getting things from God,” and group prayer becomes mainly an occasion to recite a list of our wants.
Biblical prayers, however, are multi-faceted, encompassing the whole of the desire to enter into conscious and intimate communion with our holy, perfect, and righteous God.
That such a God would bend an ear to His creatures causes praise and adoration to pour forth in abundance (Psalm 27:4; 63:1-8), produces heartfelt repentance and confession (Psalm 51; Luke 18:9-14), generates an outpouring of gratitude and thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6; Colossians 1:12), and creates sincere intercessory pleas on behalf of others (2 Thessalonians 1:11; 2:16).
Prayer, then, is cooperating with God to bring about His plan, not trying to bend Him to our will.
Jesus warned against such behavior in Matthew 6:5-8 where He exhorts us not to be showy, long-winded, or hypocritical in our prayers, but to pray secretly in our own rooms in order to avoid the temptation of using prayer hypocritically.
Prayers offered in submission to the Divine will, therefore, are always answered positively, whether offered by one person or a thousand.
The idea that corporate prayers are more likely to move the hand of God comes largely from a misinterpretation of Matthew 18:19-20, “Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.” These verses come from a larger passage which addresses the procedures to be followed in the case of church discipline of a sinning member.
For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.” These verses come from a larger passage which addresses the procedures to be followed in the case of church discipline of a sinning member.
To interpret them as promising believers a blank check for anything they might agree to ask God for, no matter how sinful or foolish, not only does not fit the context of church discipline, but it denies the rest of Scripture, especially the sovereignty of God.
In addition, to believe that when “two or three are gathered” to pray, some kind of magical power boost is automatically applied to our prayers is not biblically supportable.
Of course Jesus is present when two or three pray, but He is equally present when one believer prays alone, even if that person is separated from others by thousands of miles.
Corporate prayer is important because it creates unity (John 17:22-23) and is a key aspect of believers’ encouraging one another (1 Thessalonians 5:11) and spurring one another on to love and good deeds (Hebrews 10:24).

 The Bible does not specifically condemn gambling, betting, or the lottery.
Gambling most definitely is focused on the love of money and undeniably tempts people with the promise of quick and easy riches.
Scripture also encourages us to stay away from attempts to “get rich quick” (Proverbs 13:11; 23:5; Ecclesiastes 5:10).
Gambling most definitely is focused on the love of money and undeniably tempts people with the promise of quick and easy riches.
What is wrong with gambling?
Gambling is a difficult issue because if it is done in moderation and only on occasion, it is a waste of money, but it is not necessarily evil.
People waste money on all sorts of activities.
Gambling is no more or less of a waste of money than seeing a movie (in many cases), eating an unnecessarily expensive meal, or purchasing a worthless item.
At the same time, the fact that money is wasted on other things does not justify gambling.
Money should not be wasted.
Excess money should be saved for future needs or given to the Lord’s work, not gambled away.
While the Bible does not explicitly mention gambling, it does mention events of “luck” or “chance.” As an example, casting lots is used in Leviticus to choose between the sacrificial goat and the scapegoat.
While the Bible does not explicitly mention gambling, it does mention events of “luck” or “chance.” As an example, casting lots is used in Leviticus to choose between the sacrificial goat and the scapegoat.
Joshua cast lots to determine the allotment of land to the various tribes.
Nehemiah cast lots to determine who would live inside the walls of Jerusalem.
The apostles cast lots to determine the replacement for Judas.
Proverbs 16:33 says, “The lot is cast in the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.”
 What would the Bible say about casinos and lotteries?
Casinos use all sorts of marketing schemes to entice gamblers to risk as much money as possible.
They often offer inexpensive or even free alcohol, which encourages drunkenness, and thereby a decreased ability to make wise decisions.
Everything in a casino is perfectly rigged for taking money in large sums and giving nothing in return, except for fleeting and empty pleasures.
Lotteries attempt to portray themselves as a way to fund education and/or social programs.
However, studies show that lottery participants are usually those who can least afford to be spending money on lottery tickets.
The allure of “getting rich quick” is too great a temptation to resist for those who are desperate.
The chances of winning are infinitesimal, which results in many peoples’ lives being ruined.
Can lotto/lottery proceeds please God?
Many people claim to be playing the lottery or gambling so that they can give the money to the church or to some other good cause.
While this may be a good motive, reality is that few use gambling winnings for godly purposes.
Studies show that the vast majority of lottery winners are in an even worse financial situation a few years after winning a jackpot than they were before.
Further, God does not need our money to fund His mission in the world.
Proverbs 13:11 says, “Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow.” God is sovereign and will provide for the needs of the church through honest means.
Would God be honored by receiving donated drug money or money stolen in a bank robbery?
Of course not.
Neither does God need or want money that was “stolen” from the poor in the temptation for riches.
Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” Hebrews 13:5 declares, “Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’” Matthew 6:24 proclaims, “No one can serve two masters.

 We know that God is real because He has revealed Himself to us in three ways: in creation, in His Word, and in His Son, Jesus Christ.
The most basic proof of God’s existence is simply what He has made.
“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse” (Romans 1:20).
“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.” (Psalm 19:1).
If I found a wristwatch in the middle of a field, I would not assume that it just “appeared” out of nowhere or that it had always existed.
Based on the watch’s design, I would assume it had a designer.
But there is far greater design and precision in the world around us.
Our measurement of time is not based on wristwatches, but on God’s handiwork—the regular rotation of the earth (and the radioactive properties of the cesium-133 atom).
The universe displays great design, and this argues for a Great Designer.
If I found an encoded message, I would seek out a cryptographer to help break the code.
My assumption would be that there is an intelligent sender of the message, someone who created the code.
How complex is the DNA “code” that we carry in every cell of our bodies?
Does not the complexity and purpose of DNA argue for an Intelligent Writer of the code?
Not only has God made an intricate and finely tuned physical world; He has also instilled a sense of eternity in the heart of every person (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
Mankind has an innate perception that there is more to life than meets the eye, that there is an existence higher than this earthly routine.
Our sense of eternity manifests itself in at least two ways: law-making and worship.
Every civilization throughout history has valued certain moral laws, which are surprisingly similar from culture to culture.
For example, the ideal of love is universally esteemed, while the act of lying is universally condemned.
This common morality—this global understanding of right and wrong—points to a Supreme Moral Being who gave us such scruples.
In the same way, people all over the world, regardless of culture, have always cultivated a system of worship.
The object of worship may vary, but the sense of a “higher power” is an undeniable part of being human.
Our propensity to worship accords with the fact that God created us “in His own image” (Genesis 1:27).
God has also revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible.
Throughout Scripture, the existence of God is treated as a self-evident fact (Genesis 1:1; Exodus 3:14).
When Benjamin Franklin wrote his autobiography, he did not waste time trying to prove his own existence.
God has also revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible.
The life-changing nature of the Bible, its integrity, and the miracles which accompanied its writing should be enough to warrant a closer look.
The third way in which God revealed Himself is through His Son, Jesus Christ (John 14:6-11).
“In the beginning was the Word: the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:1,14; see also Colossians 2:9).
In Jesus’ amazing life, He kept the entire Old Testament law perfectly and fulfilled the prophecies concerning the Messiah (Matthew 5:17).
He performed countless acts of compassion and public miracles to authenticate His message and bear witness to His deity (John 21:24-25).
Then, three days after His crucifixion, He rose from the dead, a fact affirmed by hundreds of eyewitnesses (1 Corinthians 15:6).
The historical record abounds with “proof” of who Jesus is.
As the Apostle Paul said, this thing “was not done in a corner” (Acts 26:26).
We realize that there will always be skeptics who have their own ideas concerning God and will read the evidence accordingly.
And there will be some whom no amount of proof will convince (Psalm 14:1).
It all comes down to faith (Hebrews 11:6).

 Sexism is one gender, usually male, having dominance over the other gender, usually female.
 Sexism is one gender, usually male, having dominance over the other gender, usually female.
But we have to remember that when the Bible describes an action, it does not necessarily mean that the Bible endorses that action.
But we have to remember that when the Bible describes an action, it does not necessarily mean that the Bible endorses that action.
The Bible describes men treating women as little more than property, but that does not mean God approves of that action.
The Bible is far more focused on reforming our souls than our societies.
God knows that a changed heart will result in a changed behavior.
During Old Testament times, virtually every culture in the entire world was patriarchal in structure.
That status of history is very clear—not only in Scripture but also in the rules that governed most societies.
By modern value systems and worldly human viewpoint, that is called “sexist.” God ordained the order in society, not man, and He is the author of the establishment principles of authority.
It is the result of the fall of man and the introduction of sin.
The Bible describes men treating women as little more than property, but that does not mean God approves of that action.
The Bible describes men treating women as little more than property, but that does not mean God approves of that action.
That has resulted in the inequality of the standing of men and women throughout history.
The exclusion and the discrimination that we find in our world is nothing new.
Therefore, we can rightly say that the term and the practice of “sexism” is a result of sin.
The progressive revelation of the Bible leads us to the cure for sexism and indeed all the sinful practices of the human race.
To find and maintain a spiritual balance between the God-ordained positions of authority, we must look to Scripture.
The New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old, and in it we find principles that tell us the correct line of authority and the cure for sin, the ill of all humanity, and that includes discrimination based upon gender.
The cross of Christ is the great equalizer.
John 3:16 says, “Whoever believes,” and that is an all-inclusive statement that leaves no one out on the basis of position in society, mental capacity, or gender.
“You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28).
There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26-28).
The Bible is not sexist in its accurate portrayal of the results of sin in both men and women.
The Bible records all kinds of sin: slavery and bondage and the failures of its greatest heroes.
The Bible records all kinds of sin: slavery and bondage and the failures of its greatest heroes.
In the New Testament, the “Lamb that takes away the sin of the world” (see John 1:29) was born, died, was buried and rose again, and then ascended to His place in heaven, and there He intercedes for us.
The charge of sexism in the Bible is based upon a lack of knowledge of Scripture.
When men and women of all ages have taken their God-ordained places and lived according to “thus says the LORD,” then there is a wonderful balance between the genders.
That balance is what God began with, and it is what He will end with.
There is an inordinate amount of attention paid to the various products of sin and not to the root of it.
It is only when there is personal reconciliation with God through the Lord Jesus Christ that we find true equality.
“Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).
It is also very important to understand that the Bible’s ascribing different roles to men and women does not constitute sexism.
The Bible makes it abundantly clear that God expects men to take the leadership role in the church and the home.
Does this make women inferior?
Absolutely not.
Does this mean women are less intelligent, less capable, or viewed as less in God’s eyes?
Absolutely not!
What it means is that in our sin-stained world, there has to be structure and authority.
God has instituted the roles of authority for our good.
Sexism is the abuse of these roles, not the existence of these roles.

 It is interesting that a much higher percentage of people believe in the existence of heaven than believe in the existence of hell.
According to the Bible, though, hell is just as real as heaven.
The Bible clearly and explicitly teaches that hell is a real place to which the wicked/unbelieving are sent after death.
We have all sinned against God (Romans 3:23).
The just punishment for that sin is death (Romans 6:23).
Since all of our sin is ultimately against God (Psalm 51:4), and since God is an infinite and eternal Being, the punishment for sin, death, must also be infinite and eternal.
Hell is this infinite and eternal death which we have earned because of our sin.
The punishment of the wicked dead in hell is described throughout Scripture as “eternal fire” (Matthew 25:41), “unquenchable fire” (Matthew 3:12), “shame and everlasting contempt” (Daniel 12:2), a place where “the fire is not quenched” (Mark 9:44-49), a place of “torment” and “fire” (Luke 16:23-24), “everlasting destruction” (2 Thessalonians 1:9), a place where “the smoke of torment rises forever and ever” (Revelation 14:10-11), and a “lake of burning sulfur” where the wicked are “tormented day and night forever and ever” (Revelation 20:10).
The punishment of the wicked in hell is as never ending as the bliss of the righteous in heaven.
Jesus Himself indicates that punishment in hell is just as everlasting as life in heaven (Matthew 25:46).
The wicked are forever subject to the fury and the wrath of God.
Those in hell will acknowledge the perfect justice of God (Psalm 76:10).
Those who are in hell will know that their punishment is just and that they alone are to blame (Deuteronomy 32:3-5).
Yes, hell is real.
Yes, hell is a place of torment and punishment that lasts forever and ever, with no end.
Praise God that, through Jesus, we can escape this eternal fate (John 3:16, 18, 36).

 Questions about Heaven, Hell, and Eternity
                                                                                         Answer
 In Luke 18:1-7, Jesus uses a parable to illustrate the importance of persevering in prayer.
He tells the story of a widow who came to an unjust judge seeking justice against her adversary.
Because of her persistence in prayer, the judge relented.
Jesus’ point is that if an unjust judge will grant the petition of someone who perseveres in a request for justice, how much more will the God who loves us—“his chosen ones” (v. 7)—answer our prayer when we keep praying?
                                                                                         Answer
The parable does not teach, as is mistakenly thought, that if we pray for something over and over, God is obligated to give it to us.
Rather, God promises to avenge His own, to vindicate them, right their wrongs, do them justice, and deliver them from their adversaries.
Similar to the parable of the unjust judge, Jesus’ message in this passage is that if a man will inconvenience himself to provide for a needy friend, God will provide for our needs far more, since no request is an inconvenience to Him.
Jesus gives another illustration of prayer in Luke 11:5-12.
Similar to the parable of the unjust judge, Jesus’ message in this passage is that if a man will inconvenience himself to provide for a needy friend, God will provide for our needs far more, since no request is an inconvenience to Him.
Both of these passages encourage us to pray and to keep praying.
God’s promise to His children is a promise to meet our needs, not our wants.
And He knows our needs better than we do.
The same promise is reiterated in Matthew 7:7-11 and in Luke 11:13, where the “good gift” is further explained to be the Holy Spirit.
Both of these passages encourage us to pray and to keep praying.
There is nothing wrong with repeatedly asking for the same thing.
As long as what you are praying for is within the will of God (James 4:3; 1 John 5:14-15), keep asking until God grants your request or removes the desire from your heart.
Sometimes God forces us to wait for an answer to our prayers in order to teach us patience and perseverance.
Sometimes we ask for something when granting it is not yet in God’s timing for our lives.
Sometimes we ask for something when granting it is not yet in God’s timing for our lives.
Sometimes we ask for something when granting it is not yet in God’s timing for our lives.
Sometimes we ask for something that is not God’s will for us, and He says “no.” Prayer is not only our presenting requests to God; it is God’s presenting His will to our hearts.

 For a Christian, dating a non-Christian is unwise, and marrying one is not an option.
                                                                                         Answer
Second Corinthians 6:14 (KJV) tells us not to be “unequally yoked” with an unbeliever.
Instead of working together to pull the load, they would be working against each other.
While this passage does not specifically mention marriage, it definitely has implications for marriage.
Paul goes on to remind believers that they are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, who inhabits their hearts at salvation (2 Corinthians 6:15-17).
Paul goes on to remind believers that they are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, who inhabits their hearts at salvation (2 Corinthians 6:15-17).
Because of that, they are to be separate from the world—in the world, but not of the world—and nowhere is that more important than in life’s most intimate relationship—marriage.
The Bible also says, “Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character’” (1 Corinthians 15:33).
The Bible also says, “Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character’” (1 Corinthians 15:33).

 The answer to this question depends somewhat on what is meant by “living together.” If it means having sexual relations, it is definitely wrong.
Premarital sex is repeatedly condemned in Scripture, along with all other forms of sexual immorality (Acts 15:20; Romans 1:29; 1 Corinthians 5:1; 6:13, 18; 7:2; 10:8; 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Jude 7).
The Bible promotes complete abstinence outside of (and before) marriage.
Sex before marriage is just as wrong as adultery and other forms of sexual immorality, because they all involve having sex with someone you are not married to.
If “living together” means living in the same house, that is perhaps a different issue.
Technically, there is nothing wrong with a man and a woman living in the same house—if there is nothing immoral taking place.
However, the problem arises in that there is still the appearance of immorality (1 Thessalonians 5:22; Ephesians 5:3), and it could be a tremendous temptation for immorality.
The Bible tells us to flee immorality, not expose ourselves to constant temptations to immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18).
Then there is the problem of appearances.
A couple who is living together is assumed to be sleeping together—that is just the nature of things.
Even though living in the same house is not sinful in and of itself, the appearance of sin is there.
The Bible tells us to avoid the appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22; Ephesians 5:3), to flee from immorality, and not to cause anyone to stumble or be offended.
As a result, it is not honoring to God for a man and a woman to live together outside of marriage.

 At issue is not whether we should question God, but in what manner—and for what reason—we question Him.
 At issue is not whether we should question God, but in what manner—and for what reason—we question Him.
To question God is not in itself wrong.
The prophet Habakkuk had questions for God concerning the timing and agency of the Lord’s plan.
Habakkuk, rather than being rebuked for his questions, is patiently answered, and the prophet ends his book with a song of praise to the Lord.
The prophet Habakkuk had questions for God concerning the timing and agency of the Lord’s plan.
Many questions are put to God in the Psalms (Psalms 10, 44, 74, 77).
These are the cries of the persecuted who are desperate for God’s intervention and salvation.
Although God does not always answer our questions in the way we want, we conclude from these passages that a sincere question from an earnest heart is welcomed by God.
Insincere questions, or questions from a hypocritical heart, are a different matter.
“And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him” (Hebrews 11:6).
God is not intimidated by questions.
After King Saul had disobeyed God, his questions went unanswered (1 Samuel 28:6).
After King Saul had disobeyed God, his questions went unanswered (1 Samuel 28:6).
It is entirely different to wonder why God allowed a certain event than it is to directly question God’s goodness.
Having doubts is different from questioning God’s sovereignty and attacking His character.
In short, an honest question is not a sin, but a bitter, untrusting, or rebellious heart is.
God invites us to enjoy close fellowship with Him.
When we “question God,” it should be from a humble spirit and open mind.
We can question God, but we should not expect an answer unless we are genuinely interested in His answer.

It is correct that the Bible never records Jesus saying the precise words, “I am God.” This does not mean, however, that Jesus never claimed to be God.
— Jesus claimed to be God.
 Take for example the words of Jesus in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” We need only to look at the Jews’ reaction to His statement to know He was claiming to be God.
 Some who deny that Jesus is God make the claim that Jesus never said that He is God.
 Take for example the words of Jesus in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” We need only to look at the Jews’ reaction to His statement to know He was claiming to be God.
The Jews understood exactly what Jesus was claiming—deity.
— Jesus claimed to be God.
When Jesus declared, “I and the Father are one,” He was saying that He and the Father are of one nature and essence.
John 8:58 is another example.
It is correct that the Bible never records Jesus saying the precise words, “I am God.” This does not mean, however, that Jesus never claimed to be God.
Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth … before Abraham was born, I am!” This is a reference back to Exodus 3:14 when God revealed Himself as the “I AM.” The Jews who heard this statement responded by taking up stones to kill Him for blasphemy, as the Mosaic Law commanded (Leviticus 24:16).
 John reiterates the concept of Jesus’ deity: “The Word [Jesus] was God” and “the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14).
These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh.
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Is Jesus God?
Jesus Christ.
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Therefore, Jesus is God.
Thomas the disciple declared concerning Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28).
Jesus does not correct him.
Titus 2:13 encourages us to wait for the coming of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ (see also 2 Peter 1:1).
Titus 2:13 encourages us to wait for the coming of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ (see also 2 Peter 1:1).
In Hebrews 1:8, the Father declares of Jesus, “But about the Son He says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.’” The Father refers to Jesus as God, indicating that Jesus is indeed God.
Jesus declared Himself to be God.
In Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10).
These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh.
Several times in Scripture Jesus receives worship (Matthew 2:11; 14:33; 28:9, 17; Luke 24:52; John 9:38).
Jesus does not correct him.
In Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10).
Beyond these, there are many other passages of Scripture that argue for Jesus being God.
In Hebrews 1:8, the Father declares of Jesus, “But about the Son He says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.’” The Father refers to Jesus as God, indicating that Jesus is indeed God.
 The most important reason that Jesus must be God is that, if He is not God, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).
Only God could pay such an infinite penalty.
Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death.

 Yes, Jesus is the only way to heaven.
Such an exclusive statement may confuse, surprise, or even offend, but it is true nonetheless.
The Bible teaches that there is no other way to salvation than through Jesus Christ.
Jesus Himself says in John 14:6, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me.” He is not a way, as in one of many; He is the way, as in the one and only.
No one, regardless of reputation, achievement, special knowledge, or personal holiness, can come to God the Father except through Jesus.
Jesus is the only way to heaven for several reasons.
Jesus was “chosen by God” to be the Savior (1 Peter 2:4).
Jesus is the only One to have come down from heaven and returned there (John 3:13).
He is the only person to have lived a perfect human life (Hebrews 4:15).
He is the only sacrifice for sin (1 John 2:2; Hebrews 10:26).
He alone fulfilled the Law and the Prophets (Matthew 5:17).
He is the only man to have conquered death forever (Hebrews 2:14–15).
He is the only Mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5).
He is the only man whom God has “exalted .
.
.
to the highest place” (Philippians 2:9).
Jesus spoke of Himself as the only way to heaven in several places besides John 14:6.
He presented Himself as the object of faith in Matthew 7:21–27.
He said His words are life (John 6:63).
He promised that those who believe in Him will have eternal life (John 3:14–15).
He is the gate of the sheep (John 10:7); the bread of life (John 6:35); and the resurrection (John 11:25).
No one else can rightly claim those titles.
The apostles’ preaching focused on the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
Peter, speaking to the Sanhedrin, clearly proclaimed Jesus as the only way to heaven: “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).
Paul, speaking to the synagogue in Antioch, singled out Jesus as the Savior: “I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin” (Acts 13:38–39).
John, writing to the church at large, specifies the name of Christ as the basis of our forgiveness: “I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name” (1 John 2:12).
No one but Jesus can forgive sin.
Eternal life in heaven is made possible only through Christ.
Jesus prayed, “Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent” (John 17:3).
To receive God’s free gift of salvation, we must look to Jesus and Jesus alone.
We must trust in Jesus’ death on the cross as our payment for sin and in His resurrection.
“This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe” (Romans 3:22).
At one point in Jesus’ ministry, many of the crowd were turning their backs on Him and leaving in hopes of finding another savior.
Jesus asked the Twelve, “Do you want to go away as well?” (John 6:67, ESV).
Peter’s reply is exactly right: “Lord, to whom shall we go?
You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God” (John 6:68–69, ESV).
May we all share Peter’s faith that eternal life resides only in Jesus Christ.

 Questions about Salvation
                                                                                         Answer
 Once a person is saved are they always saved?
Yes, when people come to know Christ as their Savior, they are brought into a relationship with God that guarantees their salvation as eternally secure.
Numerous passages of Scripture declare the fact that, as an act of God, salvation is secure:
  (a) Romans 8:30 declares, "And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified."
This verse tells us that from the moment God chooses us, it is as if we are glorified in His presence in heaven.
Yes, when people come to know Christ as their Savior, they are brought into a relationship with God that guarantees their salvation as eternally secure.
Once a person is justified, his salvation is guaranteed—he is as secure as if he is already glorified in heaven.
(b) Paul asks two crucial questions in Romans 8:33-34 "Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
Who will bring a charge against God’s elect?
Who is he that condemns?
Christ Jesus, who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us."
No one will, because Christ is our advocate.
Who will condemn us?
No one will, because Christ, the One who died for us, is the one who condemns.
We have both the advocate and judge as our Savior.
(c) Believers are born again (regenerated) when they believe (John 3:3; Titus 3:5).
For a Christian to lose his salvation, he would have to be un-regenerated.
The Bible gives no evidence that the new birth can be taken away.
(d) The Holy Spirit indwells all believers (John 14:17; Romans 8:9) and baptizes all believers into the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13).
For a believer to become unsaved, he would have to be "un-indwelt" and detached from the Body of Christ.
(e) John 3:15 states that whoever believes in Jesus Christ will "have eternal life."
If you believe in Christ today and have eternal life, but lose it tomorrow, then it was never "eternal" at all.
Hence, if you lose your salvation, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in error.
(f) In a conclusive argument, Scripture says, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 8:38–39).
Once we are saved, we are always saved.
Our salvation is most definitely eternally secure!

 This is perhaps the most important question in all of Christian theology.
This question is the cause of the Reformation, the split between the Protestant churches and Catholic Church.
This question is a key difference between biblical Christianity and most of the “Christian” cults.
Is salvation by faith alone, or by faith plus works?
Am I saved just by believing in Jesus, or do I have to believe in Jesus and do certain things?
The question of faith alone or faith plus works is made difficult by some hard-to-reconcile Bible passages.
Compare Romans 3:28, 5:1 and Galatians 3:24 with James 2:24.
Some see a difference between Paul (salvation is by faith alone) and James (salvation is by faith plus works).
James is not saying that justification is by faith plus works, but rather that a person who is truly justified by faith will have good works in his/her life.
Paul dogmatically says that justification is by faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9), while James appears to be saying that justification is by faith plus works.
This apparent problem is answered by examining what exactly James is talking about.
James is refuting the belief that a person can have faith without producing any good works (James 2:17-18).
James is emphasizing the point that genuine faith in Christ will produce a changed life and good works (James 2:20-26).
James is not saying that justification is by faith plus works, but rather that a person who is truly justified by faith will have good works in his/her life.
If a person claims to be a believer, but has no good works in his/her life, then he/she likely does not have genuine faith in Christ (James 2:14, 17, 20, 26).
Paul says the same thing in his writings.
The good fruit believers should have in their lives is listed in Galatians 5:22-23.
Immediately after telling us that we are saved by faith, not works (Ephesians 2:8-9), Paul informs us that we were created to do good works (Ephesians 2:10).
Paul expects just as much of a changed life as James does: “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
James and Paul do not disagree in their teaching regarding salvation.
They approach the same subject from different perspectives.
Paul simply emphasized that justification is by faith alone while James put emphasis on the fact that genuine faith in Christ produces good works.

 The Bible never directly mentions smoking.
There are principles, however, that definitely apply to smoking.
First, the Bible commands us not to allow our bodies to become "mastered" by anything.
Everything is permissible for me—but I will not be mastered by anything" (1 Corinthians 6:12).
                                                                                         Answer
Smoking is undeniably strongly addictive.
Later in the same passage we are told, "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?
Can it be said that smoking is truly honoring God with your body (1 Corinthians 6:20)?
Therefore honor God with your body" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).
Smoking is undoubtedly very bad for your health.
Smoking has been proven to damage the lungs and the heart.
Can smoking be considered "beneficial" (1 Corinthians 6:12)?
Therefore honor God with your body" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).
Therefore honor God with your body" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).
Can a person honestly smoke "for the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31)?
Can a person honestly smoke "for the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31)?
We believe that the answer to these three questions is a resounding "no."
As a result, we believe that smoking is a sin and therefore should not be practiced by followers of Jesus Christ.
Some argue against this view by pointing to the fact that many people eat unhealthy foods, which can be just as addicting and just as bad for the body.
As an example, many people are so helplessly addicted to caffeine that they cannot function without their first cup of coffee in the morning.
While this is true, how does that make smoking right?
It is our contention that Christians should avoid gluttony and excessively unhealthy eating.
Yes, Christians are often hypocritical by condemning one sin and condoning another, but, again, this does not make smoking honoring to God.
Another argument against this view of smoking is that many godly men have been smokers, such as the famous British preacher C.H.
Spurgeon, who was known to smoke cigars.
Again, we do not believe this argument holds any weight.
We believe Spurgeon was wrong for smoking.
Was he otherwise a godly man and fantastic teacher of God’s Word?
No.
Was he otherwise a godly man and fantastic teacher of God’s Word?
No.
In stating that smoking is a sin, we are not stating that all smokers are unsaved.
There are many true believers in Jesus Christ who smoke.
Smoking does not prevent a person from being saved.
Smoking does not prevent a person from being saved.
Smoking is no less forgivable than any other sin, whether for a person becoming a Christian or a Christian confessing his/her sin to God (1 John 1:9).
How can I quit?
At the same time, we firmly believe that smoking is a sin that should be forsaken and, with God’s help, overcome.

The Bible is the sole objective source of all the revelation God has given us about Himself and His plan for humanity.
The Bible contains a great deal of information about the natural world that has been confirmed by scientific observations and research.

Our need for redemption does not change.
Many historical facts recorded in the Bible have been confirmed by extra-biblical sources.
Historical research often shows a great deal of agreement between biblical accounts and extra-biblical accounts of the same events.
However, the Bible is not a history book, a psychology text, or a scientific journal.
The Bible is the description God gave us about who He is, and His desires and plans for humanity.
The most significant component of this revelation is the story of our separation from God by sin and God’s provision for restoration of fellowship through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ, on the cross.
Our need for redemption does not change.
Neither does God’s desire to reconcile us to Himself.
The Bible contains a great deal of accurate and relevant information.
The Bible’s most important message—redemption—is universally and perpetually applicable to humanity.
God’s Word will never be outdated, superseded, or improved upon.
Cultures change, laws change, generations come and go, but the Word of God is as relevant today as it was when it was first written.

 In addition to Jesus’ specific claims about Himself, His disciples also acknowledged the deity of Christ.
They claimed that Jesus had the right to forgive sins—something only God can do—as it is God who is offended by sin (Acts 5:31; Colossians 3:13; Psalm 130:4; Jeremiah 31:34).
In close connection with this last claim, Jesus is also said to be the one who will “judge the living and the dead” (2 Timothy 4:1).
Thomas cried out to Jesus, “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28).
Paul calls Jesus “great God and Savior” (Titus 2:13) and points out that prior to His incarnation Jesus existed in the “form of God” (Philippians 2:5-8).
Paul calls Jesus “great God and Savior” (Titus 2:13) and points out that prior to His incarnation Jesus existed in the “form of God” (Philippians 2:5-8).
John states that “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word [Jesus] was God” (John 1:1).
Further, Jesus’ name is used alongside God’s in prayer “Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (Galatians 1:3; Ephesians 1:2).
Examples of Scriptures that teach the deity of Christ are many (see Revelation 1:17, 2:8, 22:13; 1 Corinthians 10:4; 1 Peter 2:6-8; Psalm 18:2, 95:1; 1 Peter 5:4; Hebrews 13:20), but even one of these is enough to show that Christ was considered to be God by His followers.
Jesus is also given titles that are unique to YHWH (the formal name of God) in the Old Testament.
The Old Testament title “redeemer” (Psalm 130:7; Hosea 13:14) is used of Jesus in the New Testament (Titus 2:13; Revelation 5:9).
Jesus is called Immanuel—“God with us”—in Matthew 1.
In Zechariah 12:10, it is YHWH who says, “They will look on me, the one they have pierced.” But the New Testament applies this to Jesus’ crucifixion (John 19:37; Revelation 1:7).
This would be blasphemy if Christ were not deity.
If it is YHWH who is pierced and looked upon, and Jesus was the one pierced and looked upon, then Jesus is YHWH.
Paul interprets Isaiah 45:22-23 as applying to Jesus in Philippians 2:10-11.
Further, Jesus’ name is used alongside God’s in prayer “Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (Galatians 1:3; Ephesians 1:2).
This would be blasphemy if Christ were not deity.
The name of Jesus appears with God’s in Jesus’ commanded to baptize “in the name [singular] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19; see also 2 Corinthians 13:14).
Actions that can be accomplished only by God are credited to Jesus.
Jesus not only raised the dead (John 5:21, 11:38-44) and forgave sins (Acts 5:31, 13:38), He created and sustains the universe (John 1:2; Colossians 1:16-17).
Paul interprets Isaiah 45:22-23 as applying to Jesus in Philippians 2:10-11.
Further, Christ possesses attributes that only deity can have: eternality (John 8:58), omnipresence (Matthew 18:20, 28:20), omniscience (Matthew 16:21), and omnipotence (John 11:38-44).
Now, it is one thing to claim to be God or to fool someone into believing it is true, and something else entirely to prove it to be so.
Just a few of Jesus’ miracles include turning water to wine (John 2:7), walking on water (Matthew 14:25), multiplying physical objects (John 6:11), healing the blind (John 9:7), the lame (Mark 2:3), and the sick (Matthew 9:35; Mark 1:40-42), and even raising people from the dead (John 11:43-44; Luke 7:11-15; Mark 5:35).
Moreover, Christ Himself rose from the dead.
Far from the so-called dying and rising gods of pagan mythology, nothing like the resurrection is seriously claimed by other religions, and no other claim has as much extra-scriptural confirmation.
There are at least twelve historical facts about Jesus that even non-Christian critical scholars will admit:
            12.
Paul, an enemy of Christianity, was converted by an experience which he believed to be an appearance of the risen Jesus.
Even if someone were to object to this specific list, only a few are needed to prove the resurrection and establish the gospel: Jesus’ death, burial, resurrection, and appearances (1 Corinthians 15:1-5).
While there may be some theories to explain one or two of the above facts, only the resurrection explains and accounts for them all.
Critics admit that the disciples claimed they saw the risen Jesus.
Neither lies nor hallucinations can transform people the way the resurrection did.
First, what would they have had to gain?
Christianity was not popular and it certainly did not make them any money.
Second, liars do not make good martyrs.
There is no better explanation than the resurrection for the disciples’ willingness to die horrible deaths for their faith.
Yes, many people die for lies that they think are true, but people do not die for what they know is untrue.
In conclusion, Christ claimed He was YHWH, that He was deity (not just “a god” but the one true God); His followers (Jews who would have been terrified of idolatry) believed Him and referred to Him as God.
Christ proved His claims to deity through miracles, including the world-altering resurrection.
No other hypothesis can explain these facts.
Yes, the deity of Christ is biblical.

Is there life after death?
 Job, speaking out of his despair, asked, “If a man dies, shall he live again?” (Job 14:14, ESV).
 Job, speaking out of his despair, asked, “If a man dies, shall he live again?” (Job 14:14, ESV).
All of us have been challenged by this question.
What happens to us after we die?
Do we simply cease to exist?
Is death a revolving door of departing and returning to earth?
Does everyone go to the same place after death, or do we go to different places?
Is there really a heaven and hell?
The Bible tells us that, yes, there is life after death.
To those who are redeemed and have their sin forgiven, God gives eternal life, an existence so glorious that “no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9, NLT).
Jesus Christ, God incarnate, came to the earth to pay for our sins and give us the gift of eternal life: “He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).

Three days after His crucifixion, Jesus proved Himself victorious over death by rising from the grave—He is life personified (John 11:25) and the ultimate proof that there is life after death.

The resurrection of the Christ is a well-documented event.
The apostle Paul invited people to question the over 500 eyewitnesses who saw Jesus after His resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:6).
Because Christ was raised from the dead, we have faith that we, too, will be resurrected.

The resurrection of the Christ is a well-documented event.
Because Christ was raised from the dead, we have faith that we, too, will be resurrected.
Those who have been made righteous by faith in Christ will go into eternal life in heaven, but those who have rejected Christ as Savior will be sent to eternal punishment in hell (Matthew 25:46).
Because Christ was raised from the dead, we have faith that we, too, will be resurrected.
The resurrection of Christ, which gives us the sure hope of life after death, is the cornerstone of the Christian faith (1 Corinthians 15:12–19).
The fact of life after death does not mean everyone will go to heaven, however.
Each person must make a choice in this life, a choice that will determine his or her eternal destination.
The resurrection of Christ, which gives us the sure hope of life after death, is the cornerstone of the Christian faith (1 Corinthians 15:12–19).
Those who have been made righteous by faith in Christ will go into eternal life in heaven, but those who have rejected Christ as Savior will be sent to eternal punishment in hell (Matthew 25:46).
Hell, like heaven, is a literal place.
It is a place where the unrighteous will experience the never-ending, eternal wrath of God.
Hell is described as a lake of fire where the inhabitants will be tormented day and night forever and ever (Revelation 20:10).
In hell, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, indicating intense grief and anger (Matthew 13:42).
God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked but desires them to turn from their wicked ways so that they can live (Ezekiel 33:11).
But He will not force us into submission; if we choose to reject Christ, the one and only Savior, we reject the heaven that He has prepared, and we will live eternally apart from Him.
Life on earth is a preparation for what is to come.
For believers in Christ, life after death is eternal life in heaven with God.
For unbelievers, life after death is eternity in the lake of fire.
How can we receive eternal life and avoid hell?
There is only one way—through faith in Jesus Christ.
Faith in Christ prepares us for life after death: “Whoever believes in [God’s Son] is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son” (John 3:18).
The free gift of eternal life is available to all.
“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them” (John 3:36).
We will not be given the opportunity to accept God’s gift of salvation after death.
Our eternal destination is determined in our earthly lifetimes by our reception or rejection of Jesus Christ.
“I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation” (2 Corinthians 6:2).
If we trust in the death of Jesus Christ as the full payment for our sin, and we believe in His resurrection from the dead, we are guaranteed eternal life after death, in glory (1 Peter 1:3–5).

 In order to understand absolute or universal truth, we must begin by defining truth.
Truth, according to the dictionary, is “conformity to fact or actuality; a statement proven to be or accepted as true.” Some people would say that there is no true reality, only perceptions and opinions.
Others would argue that there must be some absolute reality or truth.
One view says that there are no absolutes that define reality.
Those who hold this view believe everything is relative to something else, and thus there can be no actual reality.
Because of that, there are ultimately no moral absolutes, no authority for deciding if an action is positive or negative, right or wrong.
This view leads to “situational ethics,” the belief that what is right or wrong is relative to the situation.
Those who hold this view believe everything is relative to something else, and thus there can be no actual reality.
Of course, situational ethics leads to a subjective, “whatever feels good” mentality and lifestyle, which has a devastating effect on society and individuals.
This is postmodernism, creating a society that regards all values, beliefs, lifestyles, and truth claims as equally valid.
The other view holds that there are indeed absolute realities and standards that define what is true and what is not.
Therefore, actions can be determined to be either right or wrong by how they measure up to those absolute standards.
If there are no absolutes, no reality, chaos ensues.
If it were not an absolute, we could not be certain we could stand or sit in one place until we decided to move.
Or if two plus two did not always equal four, the effects on civilization would be disastrous.
Laws of science and physics would be irrelevant, and commerce would be impossible.
What a mess that would be!
Thankfully, two plus two does equal four.
There is absolute truth, and it can be found and understood.
To make the statement that there is no absolute truth is illogical.
Yet, today, many people are embracing a cultural relativism that denies any type of absolute truth.
A good question to ask people who say, “There is no absolute truth” is this: “Are you absolutely sure of that?” If they say “yes,” they have made an absolute statement—which itself implies the existence of absolutes.
There is absolute truth, and it can be found and understood.
They are saying that the very fact there is no absolute truth is the one and only absolute truth.
Beside the problem of self-contradiction, there are several other logical problems one must overcome to believe that there are no absolute or universal truths.
One is that all humans have limited knowledge and finite minds and, therefore, cannot logically make absolute negative statements.
A person cannot logically say, “There is no God” (even though many do so), because, in order to make such a statement, he would need to have absolute knowledge of the entire universe from beginning to end.
Since that is impossible, the most anyone can logically say is “With the limited knowledge I have, I do not believe there is a God.”
 Another problem with the denial of absolute truth/universal truth is that it fails to live up to what we know to be true in our own consciences, our own experiences, and what we see in the real world.
If there is no such thing as absolute truth, then there is nothing ultimately right or wrong about anything.
What might be “right” for you does not mean it is “right” for me.
While on the surface this type of relativism seems to be appealing, what it means is that everybody sets his own rules to live by and does what he thinks is right.
Inevitably, one person’s sense of right will soon clash with another’s.
What happens if it is “right” for me to ignore traffic lights, even when they are red?
I put many lives at risk.
If there is no absolute truth, no standard of right and wrong that we are all accountable to, then we can never be sure of anything.
If there is no absolute truth, no standard of right and wrong that we are all accountable to, then we can never be sure of anything.
People would be free to do whatever they want—murder, rape, steal, lie, cheat, etc., and no one could say those things would be wrong.
There could be no government, no laws, and no justice, because one could not even say that the majority of the people have the right to make and enforce standards upon the minority.
A world without absolutes would be the most horrible world imaginable.
From a spiritual standpoint, this type of relativism results in religious confusion, with no one true religion and no way of having a right relationship with God.
All religions would therefore be false because they all make absolute claims regarding the afterlife.
It is not uncommon today for people to believe that two diametrically opposed religions could both be equally “true,” even though both religions claim to have the only way to heaven or teach two totally opposite “truths.” People who do not believe in absolute truth ignore these claims and embrace a more tolerant universalism that teaches all religions are equal and all roads lead to heaven.

Any dogmatic belief—especially a belief in absolute truth—is viewed as intolerance, the ultimate sin.
Any dogmatic belief—especially a belief in absolute truth—is viewed as intolerance, the ultimate sin.
Those who deny absolute truth will often say that it is all right to believe what you want, as long as you do not try to impose your beliefs on others.
But this view itself is a belief about what is right and wrong, and those who hold this view most definitely do try to impose it on others.
They set up a standard of behavior which they insist others follow, thereby violating the very thing they claim to uphold—another self-contradicting position.
Those who hold such a belief simply do not want to be accountable for their actions.
If there is absolute truth, then there are absolute standards of right and wrong, and we are accountable to those standards.
This accountability is what people are really rejecting when they reject absolute truth.
The denial of absolute truth/universal truth and the cultural relativism that comes with it are the logical result of a society that has embraced the theory of evolution as the explanation for life.
If naturalistic evolution is true, then life has no meaning, we have no purpose, and there cannot be any absolute right or wrong.
Yet no matter how much sinful men deny the existence of God and absolute truth, they still will someday stand before Him in judgment.
The Bible declares that “…what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.
For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.

Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools” (Romans 1:19-22).
Yes.
Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools” (Romans 1:19-22).
Is there any evidence for the existence of absolute truth?
Yes.
First, there is the human conscience, that certain “something” within us that tells us the world should be a certain way, that some things are right and some are wrong.
Our conscience convinces us there is something wrong with suffering, starvation, rape, pain, and evil, and it makes us aware that love, generosity, compassion, and peace are positive things for which we should strive.
This is universally true in all cultures in all times.
 The second evidence for the existence of absolute truth is science.
The Bible describes the role of the human conscience in Romans 2:14-16: “Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.

This will take place on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.”
Science is simply the pursuit of knowledge, the study of what we know and the quest to know more.
Therefore, all scientific study must by necessity be founded upon the belief that there are objective realities existing in the world and these realities can be discovered and proven.
Without absolutes, what would there be to study?
How could one know that the findings of science are real?
In fact, the very laws of science are founded on the existence of absolute truth.
The third evidence for the existence of absolute truth/universal truth is religion.
All the religions of the world attempt to give meaning and definition to life.
They are born out of mankind’s desire for something more than simple existence.
Through religion, humans seek God, hope for the future, forgiveness of sins, peace in the midst of struggle, and answers to our deepest questions.
Religion is really evidence that mankind is more than just a highly evolved animal.
It is evidence of a higher purpose and of the existence of a personal and purposeful Creator who implanted in man the desire to know Him.
Fortunately, there is such a Creator, and He has revealed His truth to us through His Word, the Bible.
Fortunately, there is such a Creator, and He has revealed His truth to us through His Word, the Bible.
Knowing absolute truth/universal truth is only possible through a personal relationship with the One who claims to be the Truth—Jesus Christ.
Jesus claimed to be the only way, the only truth, the only life and the only path to God (John 14:6).
Jesus claimed to be the only way, the only truth, the only life and the only path to God (John 14:6).
The fact that absolute truth does exist points us to the truth that there is a sovereign God who created the heavens and the earth and who has revealed Himself to us in order that we might know Him personally through His Son Jesus Christ.
That is the absolute truth.

 Scripture presents conclusive evidence that Jesus Christ was in fact resurrected from the dead.
Christ’s resurrection is recorded in Matthew 28:1-20; Mark 16:1-20; Luke 24:1-53; and John 20:1–21:25.
The resurrected Christ also appeared in the Book of Acts (Acts 1:1-11).
From these passages you can gain several “proofs” of Christ’s resurrection.
First is the dramatic change in the disciples.
They went from a group of men frightened and in hiding to strong, courageous witnesses sharing the gospel throughout the world.
What else could explain this dramatic change other than the risen Christ appearing to them?
Second is the life of the apostle Paul.
What changed him from being a persecutor of the church into an apostle for the church?
It was when the risen Christ appeared to him on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1-6).
A third convincing proof is the empty tomb.
If Christ were not raised, then where is His body?
The disciples and others saw the tomb where He was buried.
When they returned, His body was not there.
When they returned, His body was not there.
Fourth, additional evidence of His resurrection is the many people He appeared to (Matthew 28:5, 9, 16-17; Mark 16:9; Luke 24:13-35; John 20:19, 24, 26-29, 21:1-14; Acts 1:6-8; 1 Corinthians 15:5-7).
Another proof of the resurrection of Jesus is the great amount of weight the apostles gave to Jesus’ resurrection.
A key passage on Christ’s resurrection is 1 Corinthians 15.
In this chapter, the apostle Paul explains why it is crucial to understand and believe in Christ’s resurrection.
The resurrection is important for the following reasons: 1) If Christ was not raised from the dead, believers will not be either (1 Corinthians 15:12-15).
2) If Christ was not raised from the dead, His sacrifice for sin was not sufficient (1 Corinthians 15:16-19).
Jesus’ resurrection proved that His death was accepted by God as the atonement for our sins.
If He had simply died and stayed dead, that would indicate His sacrifice was not sufficient.
As a result, believers would not be forgiven for their sins, and they would remain dead after they die (1 Corinthians 15:16-19).
There would be no such thing as eternal life (John 3:16).
“But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20 NAS).
Finally, Scripture is clear that all those who believe in Jesus Christ will be raised to eternal life just as He was (1 Corinthians 15:20-23).
First Corinthians 15 goes on to describe how Christ’s resurrection proves His victory over sin and provides us the power to live victoriously over sin (1 Corinthians 15:24-34).
It proclaims that, as a result of Christ’s resurrection, all who believe in Him have ultimate victory over death (1 Corinthians 15:50-58).
What a glorious truth the resurrection of Christ is!
“Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm.
Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain” (1 Corinthians 15:58).
According to the Bible, the resurrection of Jesus Christ is most definitely true.
The Bible records Christ’s resurrection, records that over 500 people witnessed the resurrected Christ, and proceeds to build crucial Christian doctrine on the historical fact of Jesus’ resurrection.

 Universalism is the belief that everyone will be saved.
There are many people today who hold to universal salvation and believe that all people eventually end up in heaven.
Perhaps it is the thought of men and women living a life of eternal torment in hell that causes some to reject the teaching of Scripture on this issue.
For some it is an over-emphasis on the love and compassion of God—and the neglect of the righteousness and justice of God—that leads them to believe God will have mercy on every living soul.
But the Scriptures do teach that some people will spend eternity in hell.
First of all, the Bible is clear that unredeemed men will dwell forever in hell.
Jesus’ own words confirm that the time spent in heaven for the redeemed will last as long as that of the unredeemed in hell.
Matthew 25:46 says, “Then they [the unsaved] will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.” According to this verse, the punishment of the unsaved is just as eternal as the life of the righteous.
Some believe that those in hell will eventually cease to exist, but the Lord Himself confirms that it will last forever.
Matthew 25:41 and Mark 9:44 describe hell as “eternal fire” and “unquenchable fire.”
 How does one avoid this unquenchable fire?
Many people believe that all roads—all religions and beliefs—lead to heaven, or they consider that God is so full of love and mercy that He will allow all people into heaven.
God is certainly full of love and mercy; it was these qualities that led Him to send His Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to die on the cross for us.
Jesus Christ is the exclusive door that leads to an eternity in heaven.
Acts 4:12 says, “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.” “There is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5).
In John 14:6, Jesus says, “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me.” John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” If we choose to reject God’s Son, we do not meet the requirements for salvation (John 3:16, 18, 36).
With verses such as these, it becomes clear that universalism and universal salvation are unbiblical beliefs.
Universalism directly contradicts what Scripture teaches.
While many people accuse Christians of being intolerant and “exclusive,” it is important to remember that these are the words of Christ Himself.
Christians did not develop these ideas on their own; Christians are simply stating what the Lord has already said.
People choose to reject the message because they do not want to face up to their sin and admit that they need the Lord to save them.
To say that those who reject God’s provision of salvation through His Son will be saved is to belittle the holiness and justice of God and negate the need of Jesus’ sacrifice on our behalf.

If this one principle were followed, it would save a lot of heartache and suffering later in marriages.
The marriage between a man and a woman is a picture of the relationship between Christ and the church.
Christ gave Himself for the church, and He loves, honors, and protects her as His “bride” (Revelation 19:7–9).

Building on the foundation of a godly marriage, many couples find practical ways to help make their marriages last: spending quality time together; saying, “I love you” often; being kind; showing affection; offering compliments; going on dates; writing notes; giving gifts; and being ready to forgive, for example.

When God brought Eve to Adam in the first marriage, she was made from his “flesh and bone” (Genesis 2:21) and they became “one flesh” (Genesis 2:23–24).
This relationship goes far beyond sensual or emotional attraction and into the realm of spiritual “oneness” that can only be found as both partners surrender to God and each other.

 The Bible does not mention masturbation or state whether or not masturbation is a sin.
The passage most frequently associated with masturbation is the story of Onan in Genesis 38:9–10.
Some interpret this passage to say that “spilling your seed” is a sin.
However, that is not what the passage is saying.
Onan refused to fulfill his duty to provide an heir for his deceased brother.
The passage is not about masturbation but about fulfilling a family obligation.
A second passage sometimes used as evidence that masturbation is a sin is Matthew 5:27–30.
God condemned Onan not for “spilling his seed” but because Onan was rebellious.
The Bible nowhere explicitly states that masturbation is a sin, but there is no question that the actions that usually lead to masturbation are sinful.
The Bible nowhere explicitly states that masturbation is a sin, but there is no question that the actions that usually lead to masturbation are sinful.
Masturbation is nearly always the result of lustful thoughts, inappropriate sexual stimulation, and/or pornography.
It is these problems that need to be dealt with.
If the sins of lust, immoral thoughts, and pornography are forsaken and overcome, masturbation will become much less of an issue and temptation.
Many people struggle with guilt concerning masturbation, when, in reality, they would be far better off repenting of the sins that lead them to masturbate.
While the Bible does not directly answer this question, there definitely are some biblical principles that can be applied to the issue:
Jesus speaks against having lustful thoughts and then says, “If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.” While there is clearly a connection between lustful thoughts and masturbation, it is unlikely that Jesus was alluding to the specific sin of masturbation in this passage.
While the Bible does not directly answer this question, there definitely are some biblical principles that can be applied to the issue:
 (1) “So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31).
If we cannot give God glory for something, we should not do it.
If we are not fully convinced that an activity is honoring to God, it is a sin.
(2) “Everything that does not come from faith is sin” (Romans 14:23).
Onan refused to fulfill his duty to provide an heir for his deceased brother.
(3) “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?
(3) “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?
Therefore, honor God with your body” (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).
However, we have serious doubts whether this scenario ever truly exists.
While the Bible does not directly answer this question, there definitely are some biblical principles that can be applied to the issue:
Masturbation is a questionable activity, at best—whether it can glorify God; whether it can be done in absolute confidence that it is right; and whether it can honor God as the owner of our bodies.

 The Bible does not explicitly state on which day of the week Jesus was crucified.
The two most widely held views are Friday and Wednesday.
Some, however, using a synthesis of both the Friday and Wednesday arguments, argue for Thursday as the day.
Jesus said in Matthew 12:40, “For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” Those who argue for a Friday crucifixion say that there is still a valid way in which He could have been considered in the grave for three days.
Jesus said in Matthew 12:40, “For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” Those who argue for a Friday crucifixion say that there is still a valid way in which He could have been considered in the grave for three days.
In the Jewish mind of the first century, a part of day was considered as a full day.
Since Jesus was in the grave for part of Friday, all of Saturday, and part of Sunday—He could be considered to have been in the grave for three days.
One of the principal arguments for Friday is found in Mark 15:42, which notes that Jesus was crucified “the day before the Sabbath.” If that was the weekly Sabbath, i.e.
In the Jewish mind of the first century, a part of day was considered as a full day.
Another argument for Friday says that verses such as Matthew 16:21 and Luke 9:22 teach that Jesus would rise on the third day; therefore, He would not need to be in the grave a full three days and nights.
But while some translations use “on the third day” for these verses, not all do, and not everyone agrees that “on the third day” is the best way to translate these verses.
Furthermore, Mark 8:31 says that Jesus will be raised “after” three days.
The Thursday argument expands on the Friday view and argues mainly that there are too many events (some count as many as twenty) happening between Christ’s burial and Sunday morning to occur from Friday evening to Sunday morning.
Proponents of the Thursday view point out that this is especially a problem when the only full day between Friday and Sunday was Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.
An extra day or two eliminates that problem.
The Thursday advocates could reason thus: suppose you haven't seen a friend since Monday evening.
The next time you see him it is Thursday morning and you say, “I haven’t seen you in three days” even though it had technically only been 60 hours (2.5 days).
If Jesus was crucified on Thursday, this example shows how it could be considered three days.
The Wednesday opinion states that there were two Sabbaths that week.
After the first one (the one that occurred on the evening of the crucifixion [Mark 15:42; Luke 23:52-54]), the women purchased spices—note that they made their purchase after the Sabbath (Mark 16:1).
The Wednesday view holds that this “Sabbath” was the Passover (see Leviticus 16:29-31, 23:24-32, 39, where high holy days that are not necessarily the seventh day of the week are referred to as the Sabbath).
The second Sabbath that week was the normal weekly Sabbath.
Note that in Luke 23:56 the women who had purchased spices after the first Sabbath returned and prepared the spices, then “rested on the Sabbath.” The argument states that they could not purchase the spices after the Sabbath, yet prepare those spices before the Sabbath—unless there were two Sabbaths.
Note that in Luke 23:56 the women who had purchased spices after the first Sabbath returned and prepared the spices, then “rested on the Sabbath.” The argument states that they could not purchase the spices after the Sabbath, yet prepare those spices before the Sabbath—unless there were two Sabbaths.
With the two-Sabbath view, if Christ was crucified on Thursday, then the high holy Sabbath (the Passover) would have begun Thursday at sundown and ended at Friday sundown—at the beginning of the weekly Sabbath or Saturday.
Purchasing the spices after the first Sabbath (Passover) would have meant they purchased them on Saturday and were breaking the Sabbath.
Therefore, according to the Wednesday viewpoint, the only explanation that does not violate the biblical account of the women and the spices and holds to a literal understanding of Matthew 12:40 is that Christ was crucified on Wednesday.
The Sabbath that was a high holy day (Passover) occurred on Thursday, the women purchased spices (after that) on Friday and returned and prepared the spices on the same day, they rested on Saturday which was the weekly Sabbath, then brought the spices to the tomb early Sunday.
Jesus was buried near sundown on Wednesday, which began Thursday in the Jewish calendar.
Thursday night (night one), Friday day (day two), Friday night (night two), Saturday day (day three), Saturday night (night three).
He could have risen as early as just after sunset Saturday evening, which began the first day of the week to the Jews.
A possible problem with the Wednesday view is that the disciples who walked with Jesus on the road to Emmaus did so on “the same day” of His resurrection (Luke 24:13).
The disciples, who do not recognize Jesus, tell Him of Jesus’ crucifixion (24:21) and say that “today is the third day since these things happened” (24:22).
Wednesday to Sunday is four days.
A possible explanation is that they may have been counting since Wednesday evening at Christ’s burial, which begins the Jewish Thursday, and Thursday to Sunday could be counted as three days.
In the grand scheme of things, it is not all that important to know what day of the week Christ was crucified.
If it were very important, then God’s Word would have clearly communicated the day and timeframe.
What is equally important is the reason He died—to take the punishment that all sinners deserve.
John 3:16 and 3:36 both proclaim that putting your trust in Him results in eternal life!
What is important is that He did die and that He physically, bodily rose from the dead.

 As with many things in life, there are extremes in the area of exercise.
Some people focus entirely on spirituality, to the neglect of their physical bodies.
Others focus so much attention on the form and shape of their physical bodies that they neglect spiritual growth and maturity.
Neither of these indicates a biblical balance.
First Timothy 4:8 informs us, “For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.” Notice that the verse does not negate the need for exercise.
Rather, it says that exercise is valuable, but it prioritizes exercise correctly by saying that godliness is of greater value.
The apostle Paul also mentions physical training in illustrating spiritual truth in 1 Corinthians 9:24-27.
He equates the Christian life to a race we run to “get the prize.” But the prize we seek is an eternal crown that will not tarnish or fade.
In 2 Timothy 2:5, Paul says, “Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor’s crown unless he competes according to the rules.” Paul uses an athletic analogy again in 2 Timothy 4:7: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” While the focus of these Scriptures is not physical exercise, the fact that Paul uses athletic terminology to teach us spiritual truths indicates that Paul viewed physical exercise, and even competition, in a positive light.
We are both physical and spiritual beings.
While the spiritual aspect of our being is, biblically speaking, more important, we are to neglect neither the spiritual or physical aspects of our health.
So, clearly, there is nothing wrong with a Christian exercising.
In fact, the Bible is clear that we are to take good care of our bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).
At the same time, the Bible warns against vanity (1 Samuel 16:7; Proverbs 31:30; 1 Peter 3:3-4).
Our goal in exercise should not be to improve the quality of our bodies so that other people will notice and admire us.
Rather, the goal of exercising should be to improve our physical health so we will possess more physical energy that we can devote to spiritual goals.

 In our age of “tolerance,” moral relativism is touted as the supreme virtue.
Every philosophy, idea, and faith system has equal merit, says the relativist, and is worthy of equal respect.
Those who favor one faith system over another or—even worse—claim a knowledge of absolute truth are considered narrow-minded, unenlightened, or even bigoted.
Of course, different religions make mutually exclusive claims, and the relativist is unable to logically reconcile outright contradictions.
For example, the Bible makes the claim that “man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment” (Hebrews 9:27), while some Eastern religions teach reincarnation.
For example, the Bible makes the claim that “man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment” (Hebrews 9:27), while some Eastern religions teach reincarnation.
The relativist essentially redefines truth in order to create a paradoxical world where multiple, contradictory “truths” can co-exist.
Jesus said, “I am the way and the truth and the life.
The Christian has publicly acknowledged that Jesus rose from the dead (Romans 10:9-10).
This acknowledgment of Truth distances the Christian from the so-called “open-mindedness” of the day.
This acknowledgment of Truth distances the Christian from the so-called “open-mindedness” of the day.
Both teachings cannot be true.
If he truly believes in the resurrection, how can he be “open-minded” concerning an unbeliever’s assertion that Jesus never rose again?
This acknowledgment of Truth distances the Christian from the so-called “open-mindedness” of the day.
Some things (such as the bodily resurrection of Christ) are non-negotiable.
Other things may be open to debate, such as who wrote the book of Hebrews or the nature of Paul’s “thorn in the flesh.” We should avoid becoming bogged down in disputations over secondary matters (2 Timothy 2:23; Titus 3:9).

Like Jesus, we must be full of both grace and truth (John 1:14).
Even when disputing/dialoguing over prominent doctrines, a Christian should exercise restraint and show respect.
It is one thing to disagree with a position; it is quite another to disparage a person.
We must hold fast to the Truth while showing compassion to those who question it.
Like Jesus, we must be full of both grace and truth (John 1:14).

 There are some Christians who believe that seeking medical attention is demonstrating a lack of faith in God.
In the Word-Faith movement, consulting a doctor is often considered a lack of faith that will actually prevent God from healing you.
In groups such as Christian Science, seeking the help of physicians is sometimes viewed as a barrier to using the spiritual energy God has given us to heal ourselves.
The logic of these viewpoints is sorely lacking.
If your car is damaged, do you take it to a mechanic or wait for God to perform a miracle and heal your car?
If the plumbing in your house bursts, do you wait for God to plug the leak, or do you call a plumber?
God is just as capable of repairing a car or fixing the plumbing as He is of healing our bodies.
The fact that God can and does perform miracles of healing does not mean we should always expect a miracle instead of seeking the help of individuals who possess the knowledge and skill to assist us.
Physicians are referred to about a dozen times in the Bible.
The only verse that could be taken out of context to teach that one should not go to physicians would be 2 Chronicles 16:12.
“In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet.
Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the LORD, but only from the physicians.” The issue was not that Asa consulted physicians, but that “he did not seek help from the LORD.” Even when visiting a doctor, our ultimate faith is to be in God, not the doctor.
There are many verses that speak of using “medical treatments” such as applying bandages (Isaiah 1:6), oil (James 5:14), oil and wine (Luke 10:34), leaves (Ezekiel 47:12), wine (1 Timothy 5:23), and salves, particularly the “balm of Gilead” (Jeremiah 8:22).
Also, Luke, the author of Acts and the Gospel of Luke, is referred to by Paul as “the beloved physician” (Colossians 4:14).
Mark 5:25-30 relates the story of a woman who had trouble with continual bleeding, a problem that physicians could not heal even though she had been to many of them and had spent all of her money.
Coming to Jesus, she thought that if she but touched the hem of His garment, she would be healed; she did touch His hem, and she was healed.
Jesus, in answering the Pharisees as to why He spent time with sinners, said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick” (Matthew 9:12).
From these verses one might sift out the following principles:
 1) Physicians are not God and should not be viewed as such.
They can sometimes help, but there will be other times when all they will accomplish is the removal of money.
2) Seeking physicians and using “earthly” remedies are not condemned in Scripture.
In fact, medical treatments are viewed favorably.
3) God’s intervention in any physical difficulty should be sought (James 4:2; 5:13).
He does not promise that He will answer the way we will always want (Isaiah 55:8-9), but we have the assurance that all He does will be done in love and thus in our best interest (Psalm 145:8-9).
So, should Christians go to doctors?
God created us as intelligent beings and gave us the ability to create medicines and learn how to repair our bodies.
There is nothing wrong with applying this knowledge and ability towards physical healing.
Doctors can be viewed as God’s gift to us, a means through which God brings healing and recovery.
At the same time, our ultimate faith and trust is to be in God, not in doctors or medicine.
As with all difficult decisions, we should seek God who promises to give us wisdom when we ask for it (James 1:5).

While a couple of the Gnostic gospels mention Jesus having a close relationship with Mary Magdalene, none of them specifically state that Jesus was married to her or to anyone else.
They have all been proven to be forgeries invented to create a Gnostic view of Jesus.
If Jesus had been married, the Bible would have told us so, or there would be some unambiguous statement to that fact.
Scripture would not be completely silent on such an important issue.
The Bible mentions Jesus’ mother, adoptive father, half-brothers, and half-sisters.
Why would it neglect to mention the fact that Jesus had a wife?
Those who believe/teach that Jesus was married are doing so in an attempt to “humanize” Him, to make Him more ordinary, more like everyone else.
They have all been proven to be forgeries invented to create a Gnostic view of Jesus.
People simply do not want to believe that Jesus was God in the flesh (John 1:1, 14; 10:30).
So, they invent and believe myths about Jesus being married, having children, and being an ordinary human being.
A secondary question would be, “Could Jesus Christ have been married?” There is nothing sinful about being married.
There is nothing sinful about having sexual relations in marriage.
There is nothing sinful about having sexual relations in marriage.
So, yes, Jesus could have been married and still be the sinless Lamb of God and Savior of the world.
At the same time, there is no biblical reason for Jesus to marry.
That is not the point in this debate.
Those who believe Jesus was married do not believe that He was sinless, or that He was the Messiah.
Getting married and having children is not why God sent Jesus.
That is not the point in this debate.

 The biblical passages regarding the flood make it clear that it was global.
Genesis 7:11 states that “all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.” Genesis 1:6-7 and 2:6 tell us that the pre-flood environment was much different from that which we experience today.
Based on these and other biblical descriptions, it is reasonably speculated that at one time the earth was covered by some kind of water canopy.
This canopy could have been a vapor canopy, or it might have consisted of rings, somewhat like Saturn’s ice rings.
This, in combination with a layer of water underground, released upon the land (Genesis 2:6) would have resulted in a global flood.
The clearest verses that show the extent of the flood are Genesis 7:19-23.
Regarding the waters, “They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.
The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet.
Every living thing that moved on the earth perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.
Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; men and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth.
Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.”
 In the above passage, we not only find the word “all” being used repeatedly, but we also find “all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered,” “the waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet,“ and “every living thing that moved on the earth perished.” These descriptions clearly describe a universal flood covering the whole earth.
Also, if the flood was localized, why did God instruct Noah to build an ark instead of merely telling Noah to move and causing the animals to migrate?
And why did He instruct Noah to build an ark large enough to house all of the different kinds of land animals found on the earth?
If the flood was not global, there would have been no need for an ark.
Peter also describes the universality of the flood in 2 Peter 3:6-7, where he states, “By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.
By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.” In these verses Peter compares the “universal” coming judgment to the flood of Noah’s time and states that the world that existed then was flooded with water.
Further, many biblical writers accepted the historicity of the worldwide flood (Isaiah 54:9; 1 Peter 3:20; 2 Peter 2:5; Hebrews 11:7).
Lastly, the Lord Jesus Christ believed in the universal flood and took it as the type of the coming destruction of the world when He returns (Matthew 24:37-39; Luke 17:26-27).
There are many extra-biblical evidences that point to a worldwide catastrophe such as a global flood.
There are vast fossil graveyards found on every continent and large amounts of coal deposits that would require the rapid covering of vast quantities of vegetation.
Oceanic fossils are found upon mountain tops around the world.
Cultures in all parts of the world have some form of flood legend.
All of these facts and many others are evidence of a global flood.

 The Bible, God’s Word, tells us what God is like and what He is not like.
Without the authority of the Bible, any attempt to explain God’s attributes would be no better than an opinion, which by itself is often incorrect, especially in understanding God (Job 42:7).
To say that it is important for us to try to understand what God is like is a huge understatement.
Failure to do so can cause us to set up, chase after, and worship false gods contrary to His will (Exodus 20:3-5).
Only what God has chosen to reveal of Himself can be known.
One of God’s attributes or qualities is “light,” meaning that He is self-revealing in information of Himself (Isaiah 60:19; James 1:17).
The fact that God has revealed knowledge of Himself should not be neglected (Hebrews 4:1).
Creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh (Jesus Christ) will help us to know what God is like.
Let’s start by understanding that God is our Creator and that we are a part of His creation (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 24:1) and are created in His image.
Man is above the rest of creation and was given dominion over it (Genesis 1:26-28).
Creation is marred by the fall but still offers a glimpse of God’s works (Genesis 3:17-18; Romans 1:19-20).
By considering creation’s vastness, complexity, beauty, and order, we can have a sense of the awesomeness of God.
Reading through some of the names of God can be helpful in our search of what God is like.
They are as follows:
       Yahweh - LORD “I Am,” meaning the eternal self-existent God (Exodus 3:13, 14).
God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and His existence will never end.
He is immortal and infinite (Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2; 1 Timothy 1:17).
God is immutable, meaning He is unchanging; this in turn means that God is absolutely reliable and trustworthy (Malachi 3:6; Numbers 23:19; Psalm 102:26, 27).
God is incomparable; there is no one like Him in works or being.
He is unequaled and perfect (2 Samuel 7:22; Psalm 86:8; Isaiah 40:25; Matthew 5:48).
God is inscrutable, unfathomable, unsearchable, and past finding out as far as understanding Him completely (Isaiah 40:28; Psalm 145:3; Romans 11:33, 34).
God is just; He is no respecter of persons in the sense of showing favoritism (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 18:30).
God is omnipotent; He is all-powerful and can do anything that pleases Him, but His actions will always be in accord with the rest of His character (Revelation 19:6; Jeremiah 32:17, 27).
God is omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere, but this does not mean that God is everything (Psalm 139:7-13; Jeremiah 23:23).
God is omniscient, meaning He knows the past, present, and future, including what we are thinking at any given moment.
Since He knows everything, His justice will always be administered fairly (Psalm 139:1-5; Proverbs 5:21).
God is one; not only is there no other, but He is alone in being able to meet the deepest needs and longings of our hearts.
God alone is worthy of our worship and devotion (Deuteronomy 6:4).
God is righteous, meaning that God cannot and will not pass over wrongdoing.
It is because of God’s righteousness and justice that, in order for our sins to be forgiven, Jesus had to experience God’s wrath when our sins were placed upon Him (Exodus 9:27; Matthew 27:45-46; Romans 3:21-26).
God is sovereign, meaning He is supreme.
All of His creation put together cannot thwart His purposes (Psalm 93:1; 95:3; Jeremiah 23:20).
God is spirit, meaning He is invisible (John 1:18; 4:24).
God is a Trinity.
He is three in one, the same in substance, equal in power and glory.
God is truth, He will remain incorruptible and cannot lie (Psalm 117:2; 1 Samuel 15:29).
God is holy, separated from all moral defilement and hostile toward it.
God sees all evil and it angers Him.
God is referred to as a consuming fire (Isaiah 6:3; Habakkuk 1:13; Exodus 3:2, 4-5; Hebrews 12:29).
God is gracious, and His grace includes His goodness, kindness, mercy, and love.
If it were not for God’s grace, His holiness would exclude us from His presence.
Thankfully, this is not the case, for He desires to know each of us personally (Exodus 34:6; Psalm 31:19; 1 Peter 1:3; John 3:16, 17:3).
Since God is an infinite Being, no human can fully answer this God-sized question, but through God’s Word, we can understand much about who God is and what He is like.
May we all wholeheartedly continue to seek after Him (Jeremiah 29:13).

 The Four Spiritual Laws are a way of sharing the good news of the salvation that is available through faith in Jesus Christ.
It is a simple way of organizing the important information in the Gospel into four points.
John 3:16 tells us, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."
John 10:10 gives us the reason that Jesus came, "I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."
However, humanity brought sin into the world, and is therefore separated from God.
Romans 3:23 affirms this information, "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
We have ruined the relationship with Him that God intended us to have.
What is the solution?

The third of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Jesus Christ is God’s only provision for our sin.
Through Jesus Christ, we can have our sins forgiven and restore a right relationship with God."
Romans 5:8 tells us, "But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 informs us of what we need to know and believe in order to be saved, "...that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures..." Jesus Himself declares that He is the only way of salvation in John 14:6, "I am the way and the truth and the life.

If you want to trust in Jesus Christ as your Savior, say the following words to God.
Saying these words will not save you, but trusting in Christ will!
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and deserve punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"

The Roman Catholic Church does not teach the sins to be unforgivable; in Catholic doctrine, the seven deadly sins can lead to mortal sins, which will send a person to hell immediately upon death, unless such sins are repented of before death.
In the fourteenth century, Dante wrote his epic poem Inferno in which he pictured Purgatory as having seven terraces corresponding to the seven deadly sins.
 Yes, pride, envy, etc., are sins that the Bible condemns; however, they are never called “the seven deadly sins” in the Bible.
The Roman Catholic Church does not teach the sins to be unforgivable; in Catholic doctrine, the seven deadly sins can lead to mortal sins, which will send a person to hell immediately upon death, unless such sins are repented of before death.
Is the idea of seven deadly sins biblical?
Proverbs 6:16–19 lists seven things that are detestable to God: 1) haughty eyes, 2) a lying tongue, 3) hands that shed innocent blood, 4) a heart that plots evil, 5) feet that are quick to rush to do wrong, 6) a false witness, and 7) a man who stirs up dissension among brothers.
Of course, this list is not what most people understand as the “seven deadly sins.”
The Roman Catholic Church does not teach the sins to be unforgivable; in Catholic doctrine, the seven deadly sins can lead to mortal sins, which will send a person to hell immediately upon death, unless such sins are repented of before death.
The traditional list of seven deadly sins can function as a way to categorize the many different sins that exist.
In the final analysis, no sin is any more “deadly” than any other sin.
All sin results in death (Romans 6:23).
Praise be to God that Jesus Christ took the penalty for all of our sins, including the “seven deadly sins.” By the grace of God, through faith in Christ, we can be forgiven (Matthew 26:28; Acts 10:43; Ephesians 1:7).

According to Islam, if the Five Pillars are obeyed, salvation will be granted.
According to Islam, if the Five Pillars are obeyed, salvation will be granted.
Because the idea of a step-by-step process to salvation is appealing, many in the Christian community make the mistake of presenting salvation as a result of a step-by-step process.
Roman Catholicism has seven sacraments.
Various Christian denominations add baptism, public confession, turning from sin, speaking in tongues, etc., as steps to salvation.
But the Bible only presents one step to salvation.
When the Philippian jailer asked Paul, “What must I do to be saved?” Paul responded, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved” (Acts 16:30-31).

 The Ten Commandments (also known as the Decalogue) are ten laws in the Bible that God gave to the nation of Israel shortly after the exodus from Egypt.
The Ten Commandments are essentially a summary of the 613 commandments contained in the Old Testament Law.
The first four commandments deal with our relationship with God.
The last six commandments deal with our relationships with one another.
The last six commandments deal with our relationships with one another.
The Ten Commandments are recorded in the Bible in Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21 and are as follows:
The Ten Commandments are recorded in the Bible in Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21 and are as follows:
All other gods are false gods.
All other gods are false gods.
On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates.
You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.” This command is against making an idol, a visible representation of God.
There is no image we can create that can accurately portray God.
There is no image we can create that can accurately portray God.
3) “You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.” This is a command against taking the name of the Lord in vain.
We are not to treat God’s name lightly.
We are to show reverence to God by only mentioning Him in respectful and honoring ways.
5) “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.” This is a command to always treat one’s parents with honor and respect.
6) “You shall not murder.” This is a command against the premeditated murder of another human being.
7) “You shall not commit adultery.” This is a command against having sexual relations with anyone other than one’s spouse.
8) “You shall not steal.” This is a command against taking anything that is not one’s own, without the permission of the person to whom it belongs.
6) “You shall not murder.” This is a command against the premeditated murder of another human being.
It is essentially a command against lying.
7) “You shall not commit adultery.” This is a command against having sexual relations with anyone other than one’s spouse.
Coveting can lead to breaking one of the commandments listed above: murder, adultery, and theft.
If it is wrong to do something, it is wrong to desire to do that same something.
Many people mistakenly look at the Ten Commandments as a set of rules that, if followed, will guarantee entrance into heaven after death.
In contrast, the purpose of the Ten Commandments is to force people to realize that they cannot perfectly obey the Law (Romans 7:7-11), and are therefore in need of God’s mercy and grace.

The Ten Commandments demonstrate that we have all sinned (Romans 3:23) and are therefore in need of God’s mercy and grace, available only through faith in Jesus Christ.

 Let’s look at how the Bible describes love, and then we will see a few ways in which God is the essence of love.
It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
Love never fails” (1 Corinthians 13:4-8a).
This is God’s description of love, and because God is love (1 John 4:8), this is what He is like.
In love, God does not force Himself on anyone.
Those who come to Him do so in response to His love.
In love, God shows kindness to all.
In love, Jesus went about doing good to everyone without partiality.
In love, Jesus did not covet what others had, living a humble life without complaining.
In love, Jesus did not brag about who He was in the flesh, although He could have overpowered anyone He ever came in contact with.
In love, Jesus willingly obeyed His Father in heaven.
“The world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me” (John 14:31).
In love, Jesus was/is always looking out for the interests of others.
The greatest expression of God’s love is communicated to us in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Romans 5:8 proclaims the same message: “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” We can see from these verses that it is God’s greatest desire that we join Him in His eternal home, heaven.
He has made the way possible by paying the price for our sins.
“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).
So, what does it mean that God is love?
Love is an attribute of God.
Love is a core aspect of God’s character, His Person.
God’s love is in no sense in conflict with His holiness, righteousness, justice, or even His wrath.
All of God’s attributes are in perfect harmony.
Everything God does is loving, just as everything He does is just and right.
God is the perfect example of true love.
Amazingly, God has given those who receive His Son Jesus as their personal Savior the ability to love as He does, through the power of the Holy Spirit (John 1:12; 1 John 3:1, 23-24).

 “But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law” (Galatians 4:4).
This verse declares that God the Father sent His Son when “the time had fully come.” There were many things occurring at the time of the first century that, at least by human reasoning, seem to make it ideal for Christ to come then.
1) There was a great anticipation among the Jews of that time that the Messiah would come.
The Roman rule over Israel made the Jews hungry for the Messiah’s coming.
2) Rome had unified much of the world under its government, giving a sense of unity to the various lands.
Also, because the empire was relatively peaceful, travel was possible, allowing the early Christians to spread the gospel.
Such freedom to travel would have been impossible in other eras.
3) While Rome had conquered militarily, Greece had conquered culturally.
A “common” form of the Greek language (different from classical Greek) was the trade language and was spoken throughout the empire, making it possible to communicate the gospel to many different people groups through one common language.
4) The fact that the many false idols had failed to give them victory over the Roman conquerors caused many to abandon the worship of those idols.
At the same time, in the more “cultured” cities, the Greek philosophy and science of the time left others spiritually empty in the same way that the atheism of communist governments leaves a spiritual void today.
5) The mystery religions of the time emphasized a savior-god and required worshipers to offer bloody sacrifices, thus making the gospel of Christ which involved one ultimate sacrifice believable to them.
The Greeks also believed in the immortality of the soul (but not of the body).
6) The Roman army recruited soldiers from among the provinces, introducing these men to Roman culture and to ideas (such as the gospel) that had not reached those outlying provinces yet.
The earliest introduction of the gospel to Britain was the result of the efforts of Christian soldiers stationed there.
The above statements are based on men looking at that time and speculating about why that particular point in history was a good time for Christ to come.
But we understand that God’s ways are not our ways (Isaiah 55:8), and these may or may not have been some reasons for why He chose that particular time to send His Son.
From the context of Galatians 3 and 4, it is evident that God sought to lay a foundation through the Jewish Law that would prepare for the coming of the Messiah.
The Law was meant to help people understand the depth of their sinfulness (in that they were incapable of keeping the Law) so that they might more readily accept the cure for that sin through Jesus the Messiah (Galatians 3:22-23; Romans 3:19-20).
The Law was also “put in charge” (Galatians 3:24) to lead people to Jesus as the Messiah.
It did this through its many prophecies concerning the Messiah which Jesus fulfilled.
Add to this the sacrificial system that pointed to the need for a sacrifice for sin as well as its own inadequacy (with each sacrifice always requiring later additional ones).
Old Testament history also painted pictures of the person and work of Christ through several events and religious feasts (such as the willingness of Abraham to offer up Isaac, or the details of the Passover during the exodus from Egypt, etc.).
Finally, Christ came when He did in fulfillment of specific prophecy.
Daniel 9:24-27 speaks of the “seventy weeks” or the seventy “sevens.” From the context, these “weeks” or “sevens” refer to groups of seven years, not seven days.
We can examine history and line up the details of the first sixty-nine weeks (the seventieth week will take place at a future point).
The countdown of the seventy weeks begins with “the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem” (verse 25).
This command was given by Artaxerxes Longimanus in 445 B.C.
(see Nehemiah 2:5).
After seven “sevens” plus 62 “sevens,” or 69 x 7 years, the prophecy states, “the Anointed One will be cut off and will have nothing.
The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary” and that the “end will come like a flood” (meaning major destruction) (v. 26).
Here we have an unmistakable reference to the Savior’s death on the cross.
A century ago in his book The Coming Prince, Sir Robert Anderson gave detailed calculations of the sixty-nine weeks, using ‘prophetic years,’ allowing for leap years, errors in the calendar, the change from B.C.
to A.D., etc., and figured that the sixty-nine weeks ended on the very day of Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem, five days before His death.
Whether one uses this timetable or not, the point is that the timing of Christ’s incarnation ties in with this detailed prophecy recorded by Daniel over five hundred years beforehand.
The timing of Christ’s incarnation was such that the people of that time were prepared for His coming.
The people of every century since then have more than sufficient evidence that Jesus was indeed the promised Messiah through His fulfillment of the Scriptures that pictured and prophesied His coming in great detail.

 Jesus is not God’s Son in the sense of a human father and a son.
God did not get married and have a son.
God did not mate with Mary and, together with her, produce a son.
Jesus is God’s Son in the sense that He is God made manifest in human form (John 1:1, 14).
Jesus is God’s Son in that He was conceived in Mary by the Holy Spirit.
Luke 1:35 declares, “The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
 During His trial before the Jewish leaders, the High Priest demanded of Jesus, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God” (Matthew 26:63).
‘But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven’” (Matthew 26:64).
The Jewish leaders responded by accusing Jesus of blasphemy (Matthew 26:65-66).
Later, before Pontius Pilate, “The Jews insisted, ‘We have a law, and according to that law He must die, because He claimed to be the Son of God’” (John 19:7).
Why would His claiming to be the Son of God be considered blasphemy and be worthy of a death sentence?
The Jewish leaders understood exactly what Jesus meant by the phrase “Son of God.” To be the Son of God is to be of the same nature as God.

The Jewish leaders understood exactly what Jesus meant by the phrase “Son of God.” To be the Son of God is to be of the same nature as God.
The Son of God is “of God.” The claim to be of the same nature as God—to in fact be God—was blasphemy to the Jewish leaders; therefore, they demanded Jesus’ death, in keeping with Leviticus 24:15.
Hebrews 1:3 expresses this very clearly, “The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His being.”
 Another example can be found in John 17:12 where Judas is described as the “son of perdition.” John 6:71 tells us that Judas was the son of Simon.

 Jesus is referred to as the “Son of Man” 88 times in the New Testament.
Son of Man is a title of humility. The Second Person of the Trinity, eternal in nature, left heaven’s glory and took on human flesh, becoming the Son of Man, born in a manger and “despised and rejected by mankind” (Isaiah 53:3).
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28).
Son of Man is a title of deity. Ezekiel may have been a son of man, but Jesus is the Son of Man.
In this way, God was simply calling Ezekiel a human being.

 Jesus saves is a popular slogan on bumper stickers, signs at athletic events, and even banners being pulled across the sky by small airplanes.
Sadly, few who see the phrase Jesus saves truly understand what it means.
Those two words pack a tremendous amount of power and truth.
Most people understand that Jesus was a man who lived in Israel about 2,000 years ago.
Virtually every religion in the world views Jesus as a good teacher and/or a prophet.
And while Jesus was truly a good teacher and a prophet, those job descriptions do not capture who Jesus truly is, nor do they explain how or why Jesus saves.
Jesus is God in human form (John 1:1, 14).
He came to Earth as a true human being (1 John 4:2) in the person of Jesus Christ in order to save us.
That brings up the next question: why do we need to be saved?
The Bible declares that every human being who has ever lived has sinned (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23).
To sin is to do anything in thought, word, or deed that contradicts God’s perfect and holy character.
Because of our sin, we are separated from God and deserve judgment from God (John 3:18, 36).
God is perfectly just, so He cannot allow sin to go unpunished.
Since God is the infinite and eternal Creator, all sin is ultimately against Him (Psalm 51:4), and only an infinite and eternal punishment is sufficient.
Eternal death—separation from God—is the only just punishment for sin.
That is why we need to be saved.
Because we have sinned against an infinite God, either a finite person (each one of us) must pay for our sins for an infinite amount of time, or an infinite Person (Jesus) must pay for our sins one time.
There is no other option.
Jesus saves us by dying in our place.
Jesus Christ sacrificed Himself on our behalf, paying the infinite and eternal penalty only He could pay (2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 John 2:2).
Jesus took the punishment that we deserve in order to save us from an eternal destiny separated from God.
Because of His great love for us, Jesus laid down His life (John 15:13), paying the penalty that we had earned, but could not pay.
Three days later, Jesus rose from the dead, demonstrating that His death was indeed sufficient to pay for our sins and that His life conquers death on our behalf (1 Corinthians 15).
Jesus saves all who will receive His gift of salvation by faith.
Jesus saves all those who cease trying to save themselves and fully trust in His sacrifice alone as the payment for sin (John 3:16; Acts 16:31).
Jesus’ sacrifice was sufficient to pay for the sins of all humanity, but His gift of salvation is only received through faith (John 1:12).
We must trust Him.
If you now understand what it means that Jesus saves, and you want to trust in Him as your personal Savior, you can, as an act of faith, communicate the following to God: “God, I know that I am a sinner, and I know that because of my sin I deserve to be eternally separated from you.
Even though I do not deserve it, thank you for loving me and providing the sacrifice for my sins through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
I believe that Jesus died for my sins, and I trust in Him alone to save me.
From this point forward, help me to live my life for you instead of for sin.
Help me to live the rest of my life in gratitude for the wonderful salvation you have provided.
Thank you, Jesus, for saving me!”

 Questions about Jesus Christ
                                                                                         Answer
 When people speak of the Bible as inspired, they are referring to the fact that God divinely influenced the human authors of the Scriptures in such a way that what they wrote was the very Word of God.
In the context of the Scriptures, the word “inspiration” simply means “God-breathed.” Inspiration means the Bible truly is the Word of God and makes the Bible unique among all other books.
While there are different views as to the extent to which the Bible is inspired, there can be no doubt that the Bible itself claims that every word in every part of the Bible comes from God (1 Corinthians 2:12-13; 2 Timothy 3:16-17).
In the context of the Scriptures, the word “inspiration” simply means “God-breathed.” Inspiration means the Bible truly is the Word of God and makes the Bible unique among all other books.
Some people believe only parts of the Bible are inspired or only the thoughts or concepts that deal with religion are inspired, but these views of inspiration fall short of the Bible’s claims about itself.
Full verbal plenary inspiration is an essential characteristic of the Word of God.
The extent of inspiration can be clearly seen in 2 Timothy 3:16, “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.” This verse tells us that God inspired all Scripture and that it is profitable to us.

The Bible claims not only to be inspired by God, but also to have the supernatural ability to change us and make us “complete.” What more can we need?
It is not just the parts of the Bible that deal with religious doctrines that are inspired, but each and every word from Genesis to Revelation.
This verse helps us to understand that even though God used men with their distinctive personalities and writing styles, God divinely inspired the very words they wrote.

The phrase "born again" literally means "born from above."
 The classic passage from the Bible that answers this question is John 3:1-21.
The Lord Jesus Christ is talking to Nicodemus, a prominent Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin (the ruling body of the Jews).
Nicodemus had come to Jesus at night with some questions.
Nicodemus had come to Jesus at night with some questions.
As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, “‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’ ‘How can a man be born when he is old?’ Nicodemus asked.
The question logically comes, "Why does a person need to be born again?"
The question logically comes, "Why does a person need to be born again?"
Only those who are born again have their sins forgiven and have a relationship with God.
You should not be surprised at my saying, “You must be born again”’” (John 3:3-7).
The phrase "born again" literally means "born from above."
Nicodemus had a real need.
He needed a change of his heart—a spiritual transformation.
Sinners are spiritually “dead”; when they receive spiritual life through faith in Christ, the Bible likens it to a rebirth.
New birth, being born again, is an act of God whereby eternal life is imparted to the person who believes (2 Corinthians 5:17; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:3; 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1-4, 18).
John 1:12, 13 indicates that being "born again" also carries the idea of "becoming children of God" through trust in the name of Jesus Christ.
The apostle Paul in Ephesians 2:1 says, "And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins" (NKJV).
To the Romans he wrote, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
How does that come to be?
Ephesians 2:8-9 states, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."
Trusting in Jesus Christ, the One who paid the penalty of sin when He died on the cross, is the means to be "born again."
"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation: the old has gone, the new has come!"
If you have never trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior, will you consider the prompting of the Holy Spirit as He speaks to your heart?
You need to be born again.
Will you pray the prayer of repentance and become a new creation in Christ today?
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God" (John 1:12-13).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and be born again, here is a sample prayer.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness—the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"

Deuteronomy 10:12, 20-21 records, “And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Hebrews 12:28-29 is a good description of this: “Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our ’God is a consuming fire.’” This reverence and awe is exactly what the fear of God means for Christians.
This is the motivating factor for us to surrender to the Creator of the Universe.

While it is done in love (Hebrews 12:6), it is still a fearful thing.
As children, the fear of discipline from our parents no doubt prevented some evil actions.
The same should be true in our relationship with God.
We should fear His discipline, and therefore seek to live our lives in such a way that pleases Him.
Believers are not to be scared of God.
We have no reason to be scared of Him.
We have His promise that nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:38-39).
We have His promise that He will never leave us or forsake us (Hebrews 13:5).
Fearing God means having such a reverence for Him that it has a great impact on the way we live our lives.

 Prayer in Jesus’ name is taught in John 14:13-14, “And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.
You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.” Some misapply this verse, thinking that saying “in Jesus’ name” at the end of a prayer results in God’s always granting what is asked for.
This is essentially treating the words “in Jesus’ name” as a magic formula.
This is absolutely unbiblical.
Praying in Jesus’ name means praying with His authority and asking God the Father to act upon our prayers because we come in the name of His Son, Jesus.
Praying in Jesus’ name means the same thing as praying according to the will of God, “This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him” (1 John 5:14-15).
Praying in Jesus’ name is praying for things that will honor and glorify Jesus.
If what we ask for or say in prayer is not for God’s glory and according to His will, saying “in Jesus’ name” is meaningless.
Genuinely praying in Jesus’ name and for His glory is what is important, not attaching certain words to the end of a prayer.
Praying for things that are in agreement with God’s will is the essence of praying in Jesus’ name.

 The Bible never specifically addresses the issue of abortion.
However, there are numerous teachings in Scripture that make it abundantly clear what God’s view of abortion is.
Jeremiah 1:5 tells us that God knows us before He forms us in the womb.
Jeremiah 1:5 tells us that God knows us before He forms us in the womb.
Psalm 139:13-16 speaks of God’s active role in our creation and formation in the womb.
Psalm 139:13-16 speaks of God’s active role in our creation and formation in the womb.
For the Christian, abortion is not a matter of a woman’s right to choose.
It is a matter of the life or death of a human being made in God’s image (Genesis 1:26-27; 9:6).
It is a matter of the life or death of a human being made in God’s image (Genesis 1:26-27; 9:6).
Simply put, abortion is murder.
The first argument that always arises against the Christian stance on abortion is “What about cases of rape and/or incest?” As horrible as it would be to become pregnant as a result of rape and/or incest, is the murder of a baby the answer?

He can preserve the life of a mother and her child despite all the medical odds being against it.
This early inducement may result in the death of the baby, but it is extremely rare that a baby must be actively aborted in order to save the life of the mother.
Third, even in the one-tenth of one-percent of abortions that are done to save the life of the mother, in the vast majority of these cases, an early induced delivery of the baby or a C-section is what is necessary, not an abortion.
Some doctors say that abortion is never medically necessary to save the life of the mother.
Ultimately, though, if the life of the mother is genuinely at risk, a decision like this can only be decided between a woman, her doctor, oftentimes the father of the child, and God.
Ultimately, though, if the life of the mother is genuinely at risk, a decision like this can only be decided between a woman, her doctor, oftentimes the father of the child, and God.
Any woman facing this extremely difficult situation should pray to the Lord for wisdom (James 1:5) as to what He would have her do.
Over 98 percent of the abortions performed today involve women who simply do not want to have the baby.
Less than two percent of abortions are for the reasons of rape, incest, or the mother’s life is at risk.
Even in these more difficult two percent of instances, abortion should never be the first option.
The life of a human being in the womb is worth every effort to allow the child to be born.
For those who have had an abortion, remember that the sin of abortion is no less forgivable than any other sin.
A woman who has had an abortion, a man who has encouraged an abortion—or even a doctor who has performed one—can all be forgiven by faith in Jesus Christ.

 The Bible contains plenty of information about serving in the military.
While many of the Bible’s references to the military are only analogies, several verses directly relate to this question.
The Bible does not specifically state whether or not someone should serve in the military.
At the same time, Christians can rest assured that being a soldier is highly respected throughout the Scriptures and know that such service is consistent with a biblical worldview.
The first example of military service is found in the Old Testament (Genesis 14), when Abraham’s nephew Lot was kidnapped by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and his allies.
Abraham rallied to Lot’s aid by gathering 318 trained men of his household and defeating the Elamites.
Here we see armed forces engaged in a noble task—rescuing and protecting the innocent.
Late in its history, the nation of Israel developed a standing army.
The sense that God was the Divine Warrior and would protect His people regardless of their military strength may have been a reason why Israel was slow to develop an army.
The development of a regular standing army in Israel came only after a strong, centralized political system had been developed by Saul, David, and Solomon.
Saul was the first to form a permanent army (1 Samuel 13:2; 24:2; 26:2).
What Saul began, David continued.
He increased the army, brought in hired troops from other regions who were loyal to him alone (2 Samuel 15:19-22) and turned over the direct leadership of his armies to a commander-in-chief, Joab.
Under David, Israel also became more aggressive in its offensive military policies, absorbing neighboring states like Ammon (2 Samuel 11:1; 1 Chronicles 20:1-3).
David established a system of rotating troops with twelve groups of 24,000 men serving one month of the year (1 Chronicles 27).
Although Solomon’s reign was peaceful, he further expanded the army, adding chariots and horsemen (1 Kings 10:26).
The standing army continued (though divided along with the kingdom after the death of Solomon) until 586 B.C., when Israel (Judah) ceased to exist as a political entity.
In the New Testament, Jesus marveled when a Roman centurion (an officer in charge of one hundred soldiers) approached Him.
The centurion’s response to Jesus indicated his clear understanding of authority, as well as his faith in Jesus (Matthew 8:5-13).
Jesus did not denounce his career.
Many centurions mentioned in the New Testament are praised as Christians, God-fearers, and men of good character (Matthew 8:5; 27:54; Mark 15:39-45; Luke 7:2; 23:47; Acts 10:1; 21:32; 28:16).
The places and the titles may have changed, but our armed forces should be just as valued as the centurions of the Bible.
The position of soldier was highly respected.
For example, Paul describes Epaphroditus, a fellow Christian, as a “fellow soldier” (Philippians 2:25).
The Bible also uses military terms to describe being strong in the Lord by putting on the whole armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-20), including the tools of the soldier—helmet, shield, and sword.
Yes, the Bible does address serving in the military, directly and indirectly.
The Christian men and women who serve their country with character, dignity, and honor can rest assured that the civic duty they perform is condoned and respected by our sovereign God.
Those who honorably serve in the military deserve our respect and gratitude.

 Angels are personal spiritual beings who have intelligence, emotions, and will.
This is true of both the good and evil angels (demons).
Angels possess intelligence (Matthew 8:29; 2 Corinthians 11:3; 1 Peter 1:12), show emotion (Luke 2:13; James 2:19; Revelation 12:17), and exercise will (Luke 8:28-31; 2 Timothy 2:26; Jude 6).
Angels are spirit beings (Hebrews 1:14) without true physical bodies.
Although they do not have physical bodies, they are still personalities.
Because they are created beings, their knowledge is limited.
This means they do not know all things as God does (Matthew 24:36).
They do seem to have greater knowledge than humans, however, which may be due to three things.
First, angels were created as an order of creatures higher than humans.
Therefore, they innately possess greater knowledge.
Second, angels study the Bible and the world more thoroughly than humans do and gain knowledge from it (James 2:19; Revelation 12:12).
Third, angels gain knowledge through long observation of human activities.
Unlike humans, angels do not have to study the past; they have experienced it.
Therefore, they know how others have acted and reacted in situations and can predict with a greater degree of accuracy how we may act in similar circumstances.
Though they have wills, angels, like all creatures, are subject to the will of God.
Good angels are sent by God to help believers (Hebrews 1:14).
Here are some activities the Bible ascribes to angels:
 They praise God (Psalm 148:1-2; Isaiah 6:3).
They worship God (Hebrews 1:6; Revelation 5:8-13).
They rejoice in what God does (Job 38:6-7).
They serve God (Psalm 103:20; Revelation 22:9).
They appear before God (Job 1:6; 2:1).
They are instruments of God’s judgments (Revelation 7:1; 8:2).
They bring answers to prayer (Acts 12:5-10).
They aid in winning people to Christ (Acts 8:26; 10:3).
They observe Christian order, work, and suffering (1 Corinthians 4:9; 11:10; Ephesians 3:10; 1 Peter 1:12).
They encourage in times of danger (Acts 27:23-24).
They care for the righteous at the time of death (Luke 16:22).
Angels are an entirely different order of being than humans.
Human beings do not become angels after they die.
Angels will never become, and never were, human beings.
God created the angels, just as He created humanity.
The Bible nowhere states that angels are created in the image and likeness of God, as humans are (Genesis 1:26).
Angels are spiritual beings that can, to a certain degree, take on physical form.
Humans are primarily physical beings, but with a spiritual aspect.
The greatest thing we can learn from the holy angels is their instant, unquestioning obedience to God’s commands.

 Being a good parent can be a difficult and challenging venture, but at the same time can be the most rewarding and fulfilling thing we ever do.
The Bible has a great deal to say about the way we can successfully raise our children to be men and women of God.
As a good parent, the first thing we must do is teach them the truth about God’s Word.
Along with loving God and being a godly example by committing ourselves to His commands, we need to heed the command of Deuteronomy 6:7-9 regarding teaching our children to do the same.
This passage emphasizes the ongoing nature of such instruction.
It should be done at all times—at home, on the road, at night, and in the morning.
Biblical truth should be the foundation of our homes.
By following the principles of these commands, we teach our children that worshiping God should be constant, not reserved for Sunday mornings or nightly prayers.
Although our children learn a great deal through direct teaching, they learn much more by watching us.
This is why we must be careful in everything we do.
We must first acknowledge our God-given roles.
Husbands and wives are to be mutually respectful and submissive to each other (Ephesians 5:21).
At the same time, God has established a line of authority to keep order.
“Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God” (1 Corinthians 11:3).
We know that Christ is not inferior to God, just as a wife is not inferior to her husband.
God recognizes, however, that without submission to authority, there is no order.
The husband’s responsibility as the head of the household is to love his wife as he loves his own body, in the same sacrificial way that Christ loved the church (Ephesians 5:25-29).
In response to this loving leadership, it is not difficult for the wife to submit to her husband’s authority (Ephesians 5:24; Colossians 3:18).
Her primary responsibility is to love and respect her husband, live in wisdom and purity, and take care of the home (Titus 2:4-5).
Women are naturally more nurturing than men because they were designed to be the primary caretakers of their children.
Discipline and instruction are integral parts of being a good parent.
Proverbs 13:24 says, “He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him.” Children who grow up in undisciplined households feel unwanted and unworthy.
They lack direction and self-control, and as they get older they rebel and have little or no respect for any kind of authority, including God’s.
“Discipline your son, for in that there is hope; do not be a willing party to his death” (Proverbs 19:18).
At the same time, discipline must be balanced with love, or children may grow up resentful, discouraged, and rebellious (Colossians 3:21).
God recognizes that discipline is painful when it is happening (Hebrews 12:11), but if followed by loving instruction, it is remarkably beneficial to the child.
“Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord” (Ephesians 6:4).
As a good parent, it is important to involve your children in the church family and ministry when they are young.
Regularly attend a Bible-believing church (Hebrews 10:25), allow them to see you studying the Word, and also study it with them.
Discuss with them the world around them as they see it, and teach them about the glory of God through everyday life.
“Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it” (Proverbs 22:6).
Being a good parent is all about raising children who will follow your example in obeying and worshiping the Lord.

 Modern birth control methods were unknown in Bible times, and the Bible is, therefore, silent on the matter.
The Bible does have quite a lot to say about children, however.
The Bible presents children as a gift from God (Genesis 4:1; Genesis 33:5), a heritage from the Lord (Psalm 127:3-5), a blessing from God (Luke 1:42), and a crown to the aged (Proverbs 17:6).
God sometimes blesses barren women with children (Psalm 113:9; Genesis 21:1-3; 25:21-22; 30:1-2; 1 Samuel 1:6-8; Luke 1:7, 24-25).
God forms children in the womb (Psalm 139:13-16).
God knows children before their birth (Jeremiah 1:5; Galatians 1:15).
The closest that Scripture comes to condemning birth control is Genesis chapter 38, the account of Judah’s sons Er and Onan.
Er married a woman named Tamar, but he was wicked and the Lord put him to death, leaving Tamar with no husband or children.
Tamar was given in marriage to Er’s brother, Onan, in accordance with the law of levirate marriage in Deuteronomy 25:5-6.
Onan did not want to split his inheritance with any child that he might produce on his brother’s behalf, so he practiced the oldest form of birth control, withdrawal.
Genesis 38:10 says, “What he did was wicked in the LORD’s sight; so He put him to death also.” Onan’s motivation was selfish; he used Tamar for his own pleasure, but refused to perform his legal duty of creating an heir for his deceased brother.
This passage is often used as evidence that God does not approve of birth control.
However, it was not the act of contraception that caused the Lord to put Onan to death; it was Onan’s selfish motives behind the action.
Therefore, we can find no biblical admonition against the use of birth control in and of itself.
Contraception, by definition, is merely the opposite of conception.
It is not the use of contraception that is wrong or right.
As we learned from Onan, it is the motivation behind the contraception that determines if it is right or wrong.
Married couples use contraception for a variety of reasons.
Some feel called to put off childbearing until they are in a better position to care for children.
Some, such as missionary couples, may feel their service to God overrides the desire for children at a particular point in time.
Some may be convinced that God has a different plan for them.
Ultimately, a couple’s motives for delaying childbearing, using contraception, or even having numerous children, are between them and God.
The inability to have children when they are desired is always presented in Scripture as a bad thing, especially considering the cultural stigma attached to childlessness at that time.
There is no one in the Bible who expressed a desire not to have any children.
At the same time, it cannot be argued from the Bible that it is wrong to use birth control for a limited time, or even permanently, for that matter.
All married couples should seek the Lord’s will in regards to when they should try to have children and how many children they seek to have.
It all comes down to this: no one has the right to determine whether someone else should or should not use birth control, how many children is the “right” number for them, or whether they should have children at all.
As in all things, we are not to judge others or cause brothers and sisters in Christ to stumble, spiritually speaking.
Note – the principles outlined in this article apply equally, generally speaking, to the various methods of birth control, including using a condom / condoms, diaphragm / diaphragms, spermicide / spermicides, contraceptives, intrauterine devices, IUD, or coitus interruptus.
Also, those who use oral or hormonal contraceptives (the Pill) or an IUD should be aware that both those methods of birth control can prevent the implantation of a fertilized ovum; in other words, low-dose oral contraceptives and IUDs can be abortifacients.

 The greatest commandment in Scripture is this: “Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength” (Deuteronomy 6:5).
Going back to verse 2, we read, “So that you, your children and their children after them may fear the LORD your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life.” Following Deuteronomy 6:5, we read, “These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts.
6-7).
Israelite history reveals that the father was to be diligent in instructing his children in the ways and words of the Lord for their own spiritual development and well-being.
The father who was obedient to the commands of Scripture did just that.
The training is designed to make clear to children the manner of life they are intended for.
This brings us to Proverbs 22:6, “Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.” To “train” indicates the first instruction that a father and mother give to a child, i.e., his early education.
The training is designed to make clear to children the manner of life they are intended for.
To commence a child’s early education in this way is of great importance.
The father who was obedient to the commands of Scripture did just that.
Ephesians 6:4 is a summary of instructions to the father, stated in both a negative and positive way.
“Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.” The negative part of this verse indicates that a father is not to foster negativity in his children by severity, injustice, partiality, or unreasonable exercise of authority.
Harsh, unreasonable conduct towards a child will only serve to nurture evil in the heart.
The word “provoke” means “to irritate, exasperate, rub the wrong way, or incite.” This is done by a wrong spirit and wrong methods—severity, unreasonableness, sternness, harshness, cruel demands, needless restrictions, and selfish insistence upon dictatorial authority.
The word “provoke” means “to irritate, exasperate, rub the wrong way, or incite.” This is done by a wrong spirit and wrong methods—severity, unreasonableness, sternness, harshness, cruel demands, needless restrictions, and selfish insistence upon dictatorial authority.
Such provocation will produce adverse reactions, deadening children’s affection, reducing their desire for holiness, and making them feel that they cannot possibly please their parents.
A wise parent seeks to make obedience desirable and attainable by love and gentleness.
This is the whole process of educating and discipline.
The positive part of Ephesians 6:4 is expressed in a comprehensive direction—educate them, bring them up, develop their conduct in all of life by the instruction and admonition of the Lord.
This is the whole process of educating and discipline.
The word “admonition” carries the idea of reminding the child of faults (constructively) and duties (responsibilities).
The Christian father is really an instrument in God’s hand.
Christian discipline is needed to enable children to grow up with reverence for God, respect for parental authority, knowledge of Christian standards, and habits of self-control.
The human father should never present himself as the ultimate authority to determine truth and duty.
It is only by making God the teacher and ruler on whose authority everything is done that the goals of education can best be attained.
Martin Luther said, “Keep an apple beside the rod to give the child when he does well.” Discipline must be exercised with watchful care and constant training with much prayer.
Christian discipline is needed to enable children to grow up with reverence for God, respect for parental authority, knowledge of Christian standards, and habits of self-control.
Chastening, discipline, and counsel by the Word of God, giving both reproof and encouragement, is at the core of “admonition.” The instruction proceeds from the Lord, is learned in the school of Christian experience, and is administered by the parents—primarily the father, but also, under his direction, the mother.

“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
The means and methods that fathers may use to teach God’s truth will vary.
As the father is faithful in role modeling, what children learn about God will put them in good standing throughout their earthly lives, no matter what they do or where they go.

 Being a mother is a very important role that the Lord chooses to give to many women.
A Christian mother is told to love her children (Titus 2:4-5), in part so that she does not bring reproach on the Lord and on the Savior whose name she bears.
Children are a gift from the Lord (Psalm 127:3-5).
In Titus 2:4, the Greek word philoteknos appears in reference to mothers loving their children.
This word represents a special kind of “mother love.” The idea that flows out of this word is that of caring for our children, nurturing them, affectionately embracing them, meeting their needs, and tenderly befriending each one as a unique gift from the hand of God.
Several things are commanded of Christian mothers in God’s Word:
 Availability – morning, noon, and night (Deuteronomy 6:6-7)
 Involvement – interacting, discussing, thinking, and processing life together (Ephesians 6:4)
 Teaching – the Scriptures and a biblical worldview (Psalm 78:5-6; Deuteronomy 4:10; Ephesians 6:4)
 Training – helping a child to develop skills and discover his/her strengths (Proverbs 22:6) and spiritual gifts (Romans 12:3-8 and 1 Corinthians 12)
 Discipline – teaching the fear of the Lord, drawing the line consistently, lovingly, firmly (Ephesians 6:4; Hebrews 12:5-11; Proverbs 13:24; 19:18; 22:15; 23:13-14; 29:15-17)
 Nurture – providing an environment of constant verbal support, freedom to fail, acceptance, affection, unconditional love (Titus 2:4; 2 Timothy 1:7; Ephesians 4:29-32; 5:1-2; Galatians 5:22; 1 Peter 3:8-9)
 Modeling with Integrity – living what you say, being a model from which a child can learn by “catching” the essence of godly living (Deuteronomy 4:9, 15, 23; Proverbs 10:9; 11:3; Psalm 37:18, 37).
The Bible never states that every woman should be a mother.
However, it does say that those whom the Lord blesses to be mothers should take the responsibility seriously.
Mothers have a unique and crucial role in the lives of their children.
Motherhood is not a chore or unpleasant task.
Just as a mother bears a child during pregnancy, and just as a mother feeds and cares for a child during infancy, so mothers also play an ongoing role in the lives of their children, whether they are adolescents, teenagers, young adults, or even adults with children of their own.
While the role of motherhood must change and develop, the love, care, nurture, and encouragement a mother gives should never cease.

 Many Christians struggle with the issue of tithing.
In some churches giving is over-emphasized.
At the same time, many Christians refuse to submit to the biblical exhortations about making offerings to the Lord.
Tithing/giving is intended to be a joy and a blessing.
Sadly, that is sometimes not the case in the church today.
Tithing is an Old Testament concept.
The tithe was a requirement of the Law in which the Israelites were to give 10 percent of the crops they grew and the livestock they raised to the tabernacle/temple (Leviticus 27:30; Numbers 18:26; Deuteronomy 14:24; 2 Chronicles 31:5).
In fact, the Old Testament Law required multiple tithes—one for the Levites, one for the use of the temple and the feasts, and one for the poor of the land—which would have pushed the total to around 23.3 percent.
Some understand the Old Testament tithe as a method of taxation to provide for the needs of the priests and Levites in the sacrificial system.
After the death of Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law, the New Testament nowhere commands, or even recommends, that Christians submit to a legalistic tithe system.
After the death of Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law, the New Testament nowhere commands, or even recommends, that Christians submit to a legalistic tithe system.
The New Testament nowhere designates a percentage of income a person should set aside, but only says gifts should be “in keeping with income” (1 Corinthians 16:2).
Some in the Christian church have taken the 10 percent figure from the Old Testament tithe and applied it as a “recommended minimum” for Christians in their giving.
The New Testament talks about the importance and benefits of giving.
We are to give as we are able.
Sometimes that means giving more than 10 percent; sometimes that may mean giving less.
It all depends on the ability of the Christian and the needs of the body of Christ.
Every Christian should diligently pray and seek God’s wisdom in the matter of participating in tithing and/or how much to give (James 1:5).
Above all, all tithes and offerings should be given with pure motives and an attitude of worship to God and service to the body of Christ.
“Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7).

 It is not the purpose of this answer to present a scientific argument in the creation vs. evolution debate.
The purpose of this article is to explain why, according to the Bible, the creation vs. evolution debate even exists in its present form.
Romans 1:25 declares, “They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised.
Amen.”
 A key factor in the state of the creation vs. evolution debate is that the majority of scientists who believe in evolution are also atheists or agnostics.
There are some who hold a form of theistic evolution.
Others take a deistic view of God, believing He exists but is not involved in the world, and everything proceeds along an uninterrupted, natural course.
Many genuinely and honestly look at the data and arrive at the conclusion that evolution better fits the data.
However, the dominant narrative in this discussion is that evolution is, somehow, incompatible with both the Bible and faith in God.
It’s important to realize that some scientists who hold to belief in evolution also believe in God and the Bible without seeing one or the other as contradictory.
However, the vast majority of evolutionary scientists hold that life evolved entirely without any intervention of a higher being.
Modern theories of evolution, in practice, are almost entirely a naturalistic science.
There are spiritual drivers behind some of these positions.
For atheism to be true, there must be an alternate explanation—other than a Creator—for how the universe and life came into existence.
Although belief in some form of evolution predates Charles Darwin, he was the first to develop a plausible, natural source for the process of evolution: natural selection.
Darwin once identified himself as a Christian, but, as a result of some tragedies that took place in his life, he later renounced the Christian faith and the existence of God.
Darwin’s goal was not to disprove God’s existence, nor did he see his theory as doing so.
Unfortunately, that is how his ideas have been promoted by those looking to enable atheism.
One reason many believers today resist modern evolutionary theory is that it so often comes packaged with a forced, atheistic worldview.
Evolutionary scientists likely would not admit that their goal is to give an alternate explanation of the origins of life and thereby to give a foundation for atheism.
And yet, according to the Bible, that is one reason the theory of evolution is approached in the way we see today.
The Bible tells us, “The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God’” (Psalm 14:1; 53:1).
The Bible also proclaims that people are without excuse for not believing in a Creator God.
“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—His eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse” (Romans 1:20).
According to the Bible, anyone who denies the existence of God is a fool.
Foolishness does not imply a lack of intelligence.
By necessity, evolutionary scientists are brilliant intellectually.
Foolishness indicates an inability to properly apply knowledge.
Proverbs 1:7 tells us, “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.”
 Atheists who support evolution frequently mock creation and/or intelligent design as unscientific and not worthy of scientific examination.
In order for something to be considered a “science,” they argue, it must be “naturalistic.” Creation, by definition, is beyond the rules of the natural world.
Since God cannot be tested, so the argument goes, creation and/or intelligent design cannot be considered science.
Strictly speaking, evolution cannot be observed or tested any more or less than intelligent design, but that does not seem to be an issue with non-believing evolutionists.
As a result, all data is filtered through the preconceived, presupposed, and pre-accepted worldview of naturalism, without alternate explanations being considered.
Neither the origin of the universe nor the origin of life can be directly tested or observed.
Both creation and evolution require a level of faith to be accepted.
We cannot go back in time to observe the origin of the universe or of life in the universe.
Those who adamantly reject creation do so on grounds that would logically force them to reject evolution as well.
If creation is true, then there is a Creator to whom we are accountable.
Evolution, as often presented today, is an enabler for atheism.
Evolution gives atheists a basis for explaining how life developed apart from a Creator God.
As such, modern theories of evolution serve as a substitute “creation story” for the religion of atheism.
The Bible is clear: God is the Creator.
Any interpretation of science that attempts to remove God from involvement with origins is incompatible with Scripture.

 Although the words “courtship” and “dating” are not found in the Bible, we are given some principles that Christians are to go by during the time before marriage.
The first is that we must separate from the world’s view on dating because God’s way contradicts the world’s (2 Peter 2:20).
While the world’s view may be to date around as much as we want, the important thing is to discover the character of a person before making any commitment to him or her.
We should find out if the person has been born again in the Spirit of Christ (John 3:3-8) and if he or she shares the same desire toward Christ-likeness (Philippians 2:5).
The ultimate goal of dating or courting is finding a life partner.
The Bible tells us that, as Christians, we should not marry an unbeliever (2 Corinthians 6:14-15) because this would weaken our relationship with Christ and compromise our morals and standards.
When one is in a committed relationship, whether dating or courting, it is important to remember to love the Lord above all else (Matthew 10:37).
To say or believe that another person is “everything” or the most important thing in one’s life is idolatry, which is sin (Galatians 5:20; Colossians 3:5).
Also, we are not to defile our bodies by having premarital sex (1 Corinthians 6:9, 13; 2 Timothy 2:22).
Sexual immorality is a sin not only against God but against our own bodies (1 Corinthians 6:18).
It is important to love and honor others as we love ourselves (Romans 12:9-10), and this is certainly true for a courtship or dating relationship.
Whether dating or courting, following these biblical principles is the best way to have a secure foundation for a marriage.
It is one of the most important decisions we will ever make, because when two people marry, they cleave to one another and become one flesh in a relationship which God intended to be permanent and unbreakable (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5).

 Depression is a widespread condition, affecting millions of people, Christians and non-Christians alike.
Those suffering from depression can experience intense feelings of sadness, anger, hopelessness, fatigue, and a variety of other symptoms.
They may begin to feel useless and even suicidal, losing interest in things and people that they once enjoyed.
Depression is often triggered by life circumstances, such as a loss of job, death of a loved one, divorce, or psychological problems such as abuse or low self-esteem.
The Bible tells us to be filled with joy and praise (Philippians 4:4; Romans 15:11), so God apparently intends for us all to live joyful lives.

This is not easy for someone suffering from situational depression, but it can be remedied through God’s gifts of prayer, Bible study and application, support groups, fellowship among believers, confession, forgiveness, and counseling.
Feelings of depression can often be solved when those suffering with depression move the focus from themselves to Christ and others.
It may not be caused by unfortunate life circumstances, nor can the symptoms be alleviated by one’s own will.
Contrary to what some in the Christian community believe, clinical depression is not always caused by sin.
Depression can sometimes be caused by a physical disorder that needs to be treated with medication and/or counseling.
Of course, God is able to cure any disease or disorder.
There are some things that those who suffer from depression can do to alleviate their anxiety.
They should make sure that they are staying in the Word, even when they do not feel like it.
Emotions can lead us astray, but God’s Word stands firm and unchanging.
We must maintain strong faith in God and hold even more tightly to Him when we undergo trials and temptations.
The Bible tells us that God will never allow temptations into our lives that are too much for us to handle (1 Corinthians 10:13).

 The topic of dinosaurs in the Bible is part of a larger ongoing debate within the Christian community over the age of the earth, the proper interpretation of Genesis, and how to interpret the physical evidences we find all around us.
Those who believe in an older age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does not mention dinosaurs, because, according to their paradigm, dinosaurs died out millions of years before the first man ever walked the earth.
The men who wrote the Bible could not have seen living dinosaurs.
Those who believe in a younger age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does mention dinosaurs, though it never actually uses the word “dinosaur.” Instead, it uses the Hebrew word tanniyn, which is translated a few different ways in our English Bibles.
Those who believe in a younger age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does mention dinosaurs, though it never actually uses the word “dinosaur.” Instead, it uses the Hebrew word tanniyn, which is translated a few different ways in our English Bibles.
Sometimes it’s “sea monster,” and sometimes it’s “serpent.” It is most commonly translated “dragon.” The tanniyn appear to have been some sort of giant reptile.
Dinosaurs like the brachiosaurus and the diplodocus, on the other hand, had huge tails which could easily be compared to a cedar tree.
These creatures are mentioned nearly thirty times in the Old Testament and were found both on land and in the water.
In addition to mentioning these giant reptiles, the Bible describes a couple of creatures in such a way that some scholars believe the writers may have been describing dinosaurs.
In addition to mentioning these giant reptiles, the Bible describes a couple of creatures in such a way that some scholars believe the writers may have been describing dinosaurs.
The behemoth is said to be the mightiest of all God’s creatures, a giant whose tail is likened to a cedar tree (Job 40:15).
Some scholars have tried to identify the behemoth as either an elephant or a hippopotamus.
Others point out that elephants and hippopotamuses have very thin tails, nothing comparable to a cedar tree.
Dinosaurs like the brachiosaurus and the diplodocus, on the other hand, had huge tails which could easily be compared to a cedar tree.
Nearly every ancient civilization has some sort of art depicting giant reptilian creatures.
Petroglyphs, artifacts, and even little clay figurines found in North America resemble modern depictions of dinosaurs.
Rock carvings in South America depict men riding diplodocus-like creatures and, amazingly, bear the familiar images of triceratops-like, pterodactyl-like, and tyrannosaurus rex-like creatures.
Roman mosaics, Mayan pottery, and Babylonian city walls all testify to man’s trans-cultural, geographically unbounded fascination with these creatures.
In addition to the substantial amount of anthropic and historical evidences for the coexistence of dinosaurs and man, there are physical evidences, like the fossilized footprints of humans and dinosaurs found together at places in North America and West-Central Asia.
So, are there dinosaurs in the Bible?
The matter is far from settled.
It depends on how you interpret the available evidences and how you view the world around you.
If the Bible is interpreted literally, a young earth interpretation will result, and the idea that dinosaurs and man coexisted can be accepted.
If dinosaurs and human beings coexisted, what happened to the dinosaurs?
While the Bible does not discuss the issue, dinosaurs likely died out sometime after the flood due to a combination of dramatic environmental shifts and the fact that they were relentlessly hunted to extinction by man.

 First of all, no matter what view one takes on the issue of divorce, it is important to remember Malachi 2:16: “I hate divorce, says the LORD God of Israel.” According to the Bible, marriage is a lifetime commitment.
God realizes, though, that, since marriages involve two sinful human beings, divorces are going to occur.
Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate” (Matthew 19:6).
God realizes, though, that, since marriages involve two sinful human beings, divorces are going to occur.
In the Old Testament, He laid down some laws in order to protect the rights of divorcées, especially women (Deuteronomy 24:1–4).
Jesus pointed out that these laws were given because of the hardness of people’s hearts, not because such laws were God’s desire (Matthew 19:8).
The controversy over whether divorce and remarriage is allowed according to the Bible revolves primarily around Jesus’ words in Matthew 5:32 and 19:9.
In Jewish custom, a man and a woman were considered married even while they were still engaged or “betrothed.” According to this view, immorality during this “betrothal” period would then be the only valid reason for a divorce.
Many interpreters understand this “exception clause” as referring to “marital unfaithfulness” during the “betrothal” period.
In Jewish custom, a man and a woman were considered married even while they were still engaged or “betrothed.” According to this view, immorality during this “betrothal” period would then be the only valid reason for a divorce.
Jesus is possibly saying that divorce is permissible if sexual immorality is committed.
However, the Greek word translated “marital unfaithfulness” is a word which can mean any form of sexual immorality.
It can mean fornication, prostitution, adultery, etc.
Jesus is possibly saying that divorce is permissible if sexual immorality is committed.
Therefore, any breaking of that bond by sexual relations outside of marriage might be a permissible reason for divorce.
Sexual relations are an integral part of the marital bond: “the two will become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5; Ephesians 5:31).
Therefore, any breaking of that bond by sexual relations outside of marriage might be a permissible reason for divorce.
If so, Jesus also has remarriage in mind in this passage.
The phrase “and marries another” (Matthew 19:9) indicates that divorce and remarriage are allowed in an instance of the exception clause, whatever it is interpreted to be.
It is important to note that only the innocent party is allowed to remarry.
Although not stated in the text, it would seem the allowance for remarriage after divorce is God’s mercy for the one who was sinned against, not for the one who committed the sexual immorality.
There may be instances where the “guilty party” is allowed to remarry, but they are not evident in this text.
Some understand 1 Corinthians 7:15 as another “exception,” allowing remarriage if an unbelieving spouse divorces a believer.
However, the context does not mention remarriage but only says a believer is not bound to continue a marriage if an unbelieving spouse wants to leave.
Others claim that abuse (spousal or child) is a valid reason for divorce even though it is not listed as such in the Bible.
While this may very well be the case, it is never wise to presume upon the Word of God.
Sometimes lost in the debate over the exception clause is the fact that, whatever “marital unfaithfulness” means, it is an allowance for divorce, not a requirement for it.
Even when adultery is committed, a couple can, through God’s grace, learn to forgive and begin rebuilding their marriage.
Surely we can follow His example and even forgive the sin of adultery (Ephesians 4:32).
However, in many instances a spouse is unrepentant and continues in sexual immorality.
That is where Matthew 19:9 can possibly be applied.
However, in many instances a spouse is unrepentant and continues in sexual immorality.
God sometimes calls people to be single so that their attention is not divided (1 Corinthians 7:32–35).
Remarriage after a divorce may be an option in some circumstances, but that does not mean it is the only option.
    Is remarriage after divorce always adultery?
The Bible makes it abundantly clear that God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16) and that reconciliation and forgiveness should mark a believer’s life (Luke 11:4; Ephesians 4:32).
However, God recognizes that divorce will occur, even among His children.
A divorced and/or remarried believer should not feel any less loved by God, even if the divorce and/or remarriage is not covered under the possible exception clause of Matthew 19:9.
A divorced and/or remarried believer should not feel any less loved by God, even if the divorce and/or remarriage is not covered under the possible exception clause of Matthew 19:9.

 Scripture has much to say regarding the drinking of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3; Deuteronomy 29:6; Judges 13:4, 7, 14; Proverbs 20:1; 31:4; Isaiah 5:11, 22; 24:9; 28:7; 29:9; 56:12).
However, Scripture does not necessarily forbid a Christian from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol.
In fact, some Scriptures discuss alcohol in positive terms.
Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.” Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from your own vineyard as a sign of God’s blessing.
Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.” Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from your own vineyard as a sign of God’s blessing.
Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.” Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from your own vineyard as a sign of God’s blessing.
Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.” Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from your own vineyard as a sign of God’s blessing.
  What God commands Christians regarding alcohol is to avoid drunkenness (Ephesians 5:18).
The Bible condemns drunkenness and its effects (Proverbs 23:29-35).
Christians are also commanded to not allow their bodies to be “mastered” by anything (1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19).
Drinking alcohol in excess is undeniably addictive.
Scripture also forbids a Christian from doing anything that might offend other Christians or encourage them to sin against their conscience (1 Corinthians 8:9-13).
In light of these principles, it would be extremely difficult for any Christian to say he is drinking alcohol in excess to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31).
Jesus changed water into wine.
Jesus changed water into wine.
In New Testament times, the water was not very clean.
Without modern sanitation, the water was often filled with bacteria, viruses, and all kinds of contaminants.
The same is true in many third-world countries today.
As a result, people often drank wine (or grape juice) because it was far less likely to be contaminated.
In 1 Timothy 5:23, Paul instructed Timothy to stop drinking water exclusively (which was probably causing his stomach problems) and instead drink wine.
In that day, wine was fermented (containing alcohol), but not necessarily to the degree it is today.
Alcohol is not, in and of itself, tainted by sin.
It is incorrect to say that it was grape juice, but it is also incorrect to say that it was the same thing as the wine commonly used today.
Again, Scripture does not forbid Christians from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol.
Alcohol is not, in and of itself, tainted by sin.
It is drunkenness and addiction to alcohol that a Christian must absolutely refrain from (Ephesians 5:18; 1 Corinthians 6:12).
Alcohol, consumed in small quantities, is neither harmful nor addictive.
In fact, some doctors advocate drinking small amounts of red wine for its health benefits, especially for the heart.
Consumption of small quantities of alcohol is a matter of Christian freedom.
Drunkenness and addiction are sin.
However, due to the biblical concerns regarding alcohol and its effects, due to the easy temptation to consume alcohol in excess, and due to the possibility of causing offense and/or stumbling of others, it is often best for a Christian to abstain from drinking alcohol.

 While the Bible does address homosexuality, it does not explicitly mention gay marriage/same-sex marriage.
It is clear, however, that the Bible condemns homosexuality as an immoral and unnatural sin.
Leviticus 18:22 identifies homosexual sex as an abomination, a detestable sin.
Romans 1:26–27 declares homosexual desires and actions to be “shameful” and “unnatural.” First Corinthians 6:9 states that homosexuals are “wrongdoers” who will not inherit the kingdom of God.
Since homosexuality is condemned in the Bible, it follows that homosexuals marrying is not God’s will and would be, in fact, sinful.
Every mention of marriage in the Bible refers to the union of a male and a female.
The first mention of marriage, Genesis 2:24, describes it as a man leaving his parents and being united to his wife.
In passages that contain instructions regarding marriage, such as 1 Corinthians 7:2–16 and Ephesians 5:23–33, the Bible clearly identifies marriage as being between a man and a woman.
Biblically speaking, marriage is the lifetime union of a man and a woman, primarily for the purpose of building a family and providing a stable environment for that family.
The biblical understanding of marriage as the union of a man and a woman is found in every human civilization in world history.
History thus argues against gay marriage.
Modern secular psychology recognizes that men and women are psychologically and emotionally designed to complement one another.
In regard to the family, psychologists contend that a union between a man and woman in which both spouses serve as good gender role models is the best environment in which to raise well-adjusted children.
So psychology also argues against gay marriage.
Anatomically, men and women were clearly designed to fit together sexually.
The “natural” purpose of sexual intercourse is procreation, and only a sexual relationship between a man and a woman can fulfill this purpose.
In this way, nature argues against gay marriage.
So, if the Bible, history, psychology, and nature all argue for marriage being between a man and a woman—why is there such a controversy today?
Why are those who are opposed to gay marriage/same-sex marriage labeled as hateful people or intolerant bigots, no matter how respectfully the opposition is presented?
Why is the gay rights movement so aggressively pushing for gay marriage/same-sex marriage when most people, religious and non-religious, are supportive of gay couples having the same legal rights as married couples through some form of civil union?
The  answer, according to the Bible, is that everyone inherently knows that homosexuality is immoral and unnatural.
Romans 1:18–32 says that God has made the truth plain.
But the truth is rejected and replaced with a lie.
The lie is then promoted and the truth suppressed.
One way to suppress the truth is to normalize homosexuality and marginalize those who oppose it.
And a good way to normalize homosexuality is to place gay marriage/same-sex marriage on an equal plane with traditional, opposite-gender marriage.
To sanction gay marriage/same-sex marriage is to approve of the homosexual lifestyle, which the Bible clearly and consistently labels as sinful.
Christians should stand firmly against the idea of gay marriage/same-sex marriage.
Further, there are strong, logical arguments against gay marriage/same-sex marriage from contexts apart from the Bible.
One does not have to be an evangelical Christian to recognize that marriage is between a man and a woman.
According to the Bible, marriage is ordained by God as the lifetime union of a man and a woman (Genesis 2:21–24; Matthew 19:4–6).
Gay marriage/same-sex marriage is a perversion of the institution of marriage and an offense to the God who created marriage.
As Christians, we do not condone or ignore sin.
Rather, we share the love of God and act as ministers of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18).
We point to the forgiveness of sins that is available to all, including homosexuals, through Jesus Christ.
We speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15) and contend for truth with “gentleness and respect” (1 Peter 3:15).

 Questions about Marriage
                                                                                         Answer
 Paul’s charge to us in Romans 13:8 to owe nothing but love is a powerful reminder of God’s distaste for all forms of debt that are not being paid in a timely manner (see also Psalm 37:21).
At the same time, the Bible does not explicitly command against all forms of debt.
The Bible warns against debt, and extols the virtue of not going into debt, but does not forbid debt.
The Bible has harsh words of condemnation for lenders who abuse those who are bound to them in debt, but it does not condemn the debtor.
Some people question the charging of any interest on loans, but several times in the Bible we see that a fair interest rate is expected to be received on borrowed money (Proverbs 28:8; Matthew 25:27).
In ancient Israel the Law did prohibit charging interest on one category of loans—those made to the poor (Leviticus 25:35-38).
This law had many social, financial, and spiritual implications, but two are especially worth mentioning.
First, the law genuinely helped the poor by not making their situation worse.
It was bad enough to have fallen into poverty, and it could be humiliating to have to seek assistance.
But if, in addition to repaying the loan, a poor person had to make crushing interest payments, the obligation would be more hurtful than helpful.
Second, the law taught an important spiritual lesson.
For a lender to forego interest on a loan to a poor person would be an act of mercy.
He would be losing the use of that money while it was loaned out.
Yet that would be a tangible way of expressing gratitude to God for His mercy in not charging His people “interest” for the grace He has extended to them.
Just as God had mercifully brought the Israelites out of Egypt when they were nothing but penniless slaves and had given them a land of their own (Leviticus 25:38), so He expected them to express similar kindness to their own poor citizens.
Christians are in a parallel situation.
The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus has paid our sin debt to God.
Now, as we have opportunity, we can help others in need, particularly fellow believers, with loans that do not escalate their troubles.
Jesus even gave a parable along these lines about two creditors and their attitude toward forgiveness (Matthew 18:23-35).
The Bible neither expressly forbids nor condones the borrowing of money.
The wisdom of the Bible teaches us that it is usually not a good idea to go into debt.
Debt essentially makes us a slave to the one who provides the loan.
At the same time, in some situations going into debt is a “necessary evil.” As long as money is being handled wisely and the debt payments are manageable, a Christian can take on the burden of financial debt if it is absolutely necessary.

However, the contexts of Isaiah 53 and 1 Peter 2 make it clear that it is speaking of spiritual healing.
 Isaiah 53:5, which is then quoted in 1 Peter 2:24, is a key verse on healing, but it is often misunderstood and misapplied.
“But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.” The word translated “healed” can mean either spiritual or physical healing.
The verse is talking about sin and righteousness, not sickness and disease.
However, the contexts of Isaiah 53 and 1 Peter 2 make it clear that it is speaking of spiritual healing.
The Bible does not specifically link physical healing with spiritual healing.
Therefore, being “healed” in both these verses is speaking of being forgiven and saved, not physically healed.
The Bible does not specifically link physical healing with spiritual healing.
Sometimes people are physically healed when they place their faith in Christ, but this is not always the case.
Sometimes it is God’s will to heal, but sometimes it is not.
The apostle John gives us the proper perspective: “This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
And if we know that He hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of Him” (1 John 5:14-15).
And if we know that He hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of Him” (1 John 5:14-15).
God still performs miracles.
Sickness, disease, pain, and death are still realities in this world.
Unless the Lord returns, everyone who is alive today will die, and the vast majority of them (Christians included) will die as the result of a physical problem (disease, sickness, injury).
It is not always God’s will to heal us physically.
Ultimately, our full physical healing awaits us in heaven.
In heaven, there will be no more pain, sickness, disease, suffering, or death (Revelation 21).
In heaven, there will be no more pain, sickness, disease, suffering, or death (Revelation 21).
We all need to be less preoccupied with our physical condition in this world and a lot more concerned with our spiritual condition (Romans 12:1-2).
Revelation 21:4 describes the true healing we should all be longing for: “He will wipe every tear from their eyes.

On the other hand, the Bible clearly and consistently declares that homosexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19:1–13; Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:10).
Romans 1:26–27 teaches that homosexuality is a result of denying and disobeying God.
So, homosexual attraction does not always result in active, willful sin—there may not be a conscious choice to sin—but it springs from the sinful nature.
First Corinthians 6:9 proclaims that those who practice homosexuality, and therefore transgress God’s created order, are not saved.
That does not excuse the person’s choosing to sin by giving in to sinful desires.
Romans 1:26–27 teaches that homosexuality is a result of denying and disobeying God.
A person may be born with a greater susceptibility to homosexuality, just as some people are born with a tendency to violence and other sins.
Just because a person is born with a greater susceptibility to fits of rage, that doesn’t make it right for him to give in to those desires and explode at every provocation.
                                                                                         Answer
The same is true with a susceptibility to homosexuality.
Finally, the Bible does not describe homosexuality as a “greater” sin than any other.
All sin is offensive to God.
Romans 1:26–27 teaches that homosexuality is a result of denying and disobeying God.
According to the Bible, God’s forgiveness is available to the homosexual just as it is to the adulterer, idol worshiper, murderer, and thief.
God promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).
                                                                                         Answer

 The Bible is very clear as to what our purpose in life should be.
Men in both the Old and New Testaments sought for and discovered life’s purpose.
Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, discovered the futility of life when it is lived only for this world.
He gives these concluding remarks in the book of Ecclesiastes: "Here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.
For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil" (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14).
Solomon says that life is all about honoring God with our thoughts and lives and thus keeping His commandments, for one day we will stand before Him in judgment.
Part of our purpose in life is to fear God and obey Him.
Another part of our purpose is to see life on this earth in perspective.
Unlike those whose focus is on this life, King David looked for His satisfaction in the time to come.
He said, "And I—in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness" (Psalm 17:15).
To David, full satisfaction would come on the day when he awoke (in the next life) both beholding God’s face (fellowship with Him) and being like Him (1 John 3:2).
In Psalm 73, Asaph talks about how he was tempted to envy the wicked who seemed to have no cares and built their fortunes upon the backs of those they took advantage of, but then he considered their ultimate end.
In contrast to what they sought after, he states in verse 25 what mattered to him: "Whom have I in heaven but you?
And earth has nothing I desire besides you" (verse 25).
To Asaph, a relationship with God mattered above all else in life.
Without that relationship, life has no real purpose.
The apostle Paul talked about all he had achieved religiously before being confronted by the risen Christ, and he concluded that all of it was like a pile of manure compared to the excellence of knowing Christ Jesus.
In Philippians 3:9-10, Paul says that he wants nothing more than to know Christ and “be found in Him,” to have His righteousness and to live by faith in Him, even if it meant suffering and dying.
Paul’s purpose was knowing Christ, having a righteousness obtained through faith in Him, and living in fellowship with Him, even when that brought on suffering (2 Timothy 3:12).
Ultimately, he looked for the time when he would be a part of the "resurrection from the dead."
Our purpose in life, as God originally created man, is 1) glorify God and enjoy fellowship with Him, 2) have good relationships with others, 3) work, and 4) have dominion over the earth.
But with man’s fall into sin, fellowship with God is broken, relationships with others are strained, work seems to always be frustrating, and man struggles to maintain any semblance of dominion over nature.
Only by restoring fellowship with God, through faith in Jesus Christ, can purpose in life be rediscovered.
The purpose of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.
We glorify God by fearing and obeying Him, keeping our eyes on our future home in heaven, and knowing Him intimately.
We enjoy God by following His purpose for our lives, which enables us to experience true and lasting joy—the abundant life that He desires for us.

 The Old Testament Law commanded the Israelites not to engage in interracial marriage (Deuteronomy 7:3–4).
However, the reason for this command was not skin color or ethnicity.
Rather, it was religious.
The Bible never says that interracial marriage is wrong.
Anyone who forbids interracial marriage is doing so without biblical authority.
A similar principle of spiritual purity is laid out in the New Testament, but it has nothing to do with race: “Do not be yoked together with unbelievers.
Just as the Israelites (believers in the one true God) were commanded not to marry idolaters, so Christians (believers in the one true God) are commanded not to marry unbelievers.
For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?
For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?
Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14).
Just as the Israelites (believers in the one true God) were commanded not to marry idolaters, so Christians (believers in the one true God) are commanded not to marry unbelievers.
The Bible never says that interracial marriage is wrong.
As Martin Luther King, Jr., noted, a person should be judged by his or her character, not by skin color.
There is no place in the life of the Christian for favoritism based on race (James 2:1–10).
When selecting a mate, a Christian should first find out if the potential spouse is born again by faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:3–5).
Faith in Christ, not skin color, is the biblical standard for choosing a spouse.
Interracial marriage is not a matter of right or wrong but of wisdom, discernment, and prayer.
A couple considering marriage needs to weigh many factors.
A couple considering marriage needs to weigh many factors.
In fact, the biblical perspective is that there is only one “race”—the human race, with everyone having descended from Adam and Eve.
While a difference in skin color should not be ignored, it absolutely should not be the determining factor in whether a couple should marry.
Faith in Christ, not skin color, is the biblical standard for choosing a spouse.

 The Bible has a lot to say about managing finances.
Concerning borrowing, the Bible generally advises against it.
See Proverbs 6:1-5; 20:16; 22:7, 26-27 (“The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.... Do not be a man who strikes hands in pledge or puts up security for debts; if you lack the means to pay, your very bed will be snatched from under you”).
Over and over again, the Bible warns against the accumulation of wealth and encourages us to seek spiritual riches instead.
Proverbs 28:20: “A faithful man will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished.” See also Proverbs 10:15; 11:4; 18:11; 23:5.
Proverbs 6:6-11 offers wisdom concerning laziness and the financial ruin that inevitably results.
We are told to consider the industrious ant who works to store up food for itself.
The passage also warns against sleeping when we should be working at something profitable.
A “sluggard” is a lazy, slothful person who would rather rest than work.
His end is assured—poverty and want.
At the other end of the spectrum is the one who is obsessed with gaining money.
Such a one, according to Ecclesiastes 5:10, never has enough wealth to satisfy him and must be constantly grasping more and more.
First Timothy 6:6-11 also warns against the trap of desiring wealth.
Rather than desiring to heap riches upon ourselves, the biblical model is one of giving, not getting.
“Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:6-7).
We are also encouraged to be good stewards of what God has given us.
In Luke 16:1-13, Jesus told the parable of the dishonest steward as a way of warning us against poor stewardship.
The moral of the story is “So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?” (v. 11).
We are also responsible to provide for our own household, as 1 Timothy 5:8 reminds us: “If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.”
 In summary, what does the Bible say about managing money?
The answer can be summarized with a single word—wisdom.
We are to be wise with our money.
We are to save money, but not hoard it.
We are to spend money, but with discretion and control.
We are to give back to the Lord, joyfully and sacrificially.
We are to use our money to help others, but with discernment and the guidance of God’s Spirit.
It is not wrong to be rich, but it is wrong to love money.
It is not wrong to be poor, but it is wrong to waste money on trivial things.
The Bible’s consistent message on managing money is to be wise.

 The Bible records the creation of marriage in Genesis 2:23–24: “The man said, ‘This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called “woman,” for she was taken out of man.’ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.” God created man and then made woman to complement him.
In the Bible marriage is God’s “fix” for the fact that “it is not good for the man to be alone” (Genesis 2:18).
As the Bible describes the first marriage, it uses the word helper to identify Eve (Genesis 2:20).
To “help” in this context means “to surround, to protect or aid.” God created Eve to come alongside Adam as his "other half," to be his aid and his helper.
The Bible says that marriage causes a man and woman to become “one flesh.” This oneness is manifested most fully in the physical union of sexual intimacy.
The New Testament adds a warning regarding this oneness: “So they are no longer two, but one.
Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate” (Matthew 19:6).
Several of Paul’s epistles refer to marriage and how believers are to operate within the marriage relationship.
One such passage is Ephesians 5:22–33.
Studying this passage provides some key truths concerning what the Bible says marriage should be.
The Bible, in Ephesians 5, says a successful biblical marriage involves both the husband and the wife fulfilling certain roles: “Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior” (Ephesians 5:22–23).
“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her” (Ephesians 5:25).
“In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.
He who loves his wife loves himself.
After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church” (Ephesians 5:28–29).
“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh” (Ephesians 5:31).
When a believing husband and wife institute God’s principles of marriage in the Bible, a solid, healthy marriage results.
A biblically based marriage keeps Christ as the head of the man and the wife together.
The biblical concept of marriage involves a oneness between a husband and wife that pictures the oneness of Christ with His church.

 Questions about Marriage
                                                                                         Answer
 By far, the most searched for terms on the internet are related to pornography.
Pornography is rampant in the world today.
Perhaps more than anything else, Satan has succeeded in twisting and perverting sex.
He has taken what is good and right (loving sex between a husband and wife) and replaced it with lust, pornography, adultery, rape, and homosexuality.
Pornography can be the first step on a very slippery slope of ever-increasing wickedness and immorality (Romans 6:19).
The addictive nature of pornography is well documented.
Just as a drug user must consume greater quantities of drugs or more powerful drugs to achieve the same “high,” pornography drags a person deeper and deeper into hard-core sexual addictions and ungodly desires.
The three main categories of sin are the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (1 John 2:16).
Pornography definitely causes us to lust after flesh, and it is undeniably a lust of the eyes.
Pornography definitely does not qualify as one of the things we are to think about, according to Philippians 4:8.
Pornography is addictive (1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19) and destructive (Proverbs 6:25-28; Ezekiel 20:30; Ephesians 4:19).
Lusting after other people in our minds, which is the essence of pornography, is offensive to God (Matthew 5:28).
When habitual devotion to pornography characterizes a person’s life and he/she continues in sin without seeking help, making no attempt to stop or feeling no desire to change his/her behavior, it demonstrates the person may not be saved (1 Corinthians 6:9-12).
For those involved in pornography, God can and will give the victory.
Are you involved with pornography and desire freedom from it?
Here are some steps to victory: 1) Confess your sin to God (1 John 1:9).
2) Ask God to cleanse, renew, and transform your mind (Romans 12:2).
3) Ask God to fill your mind with things that are true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, and commendable (Philippians 4:8).
4) Learn to possess your body in holiness (1 Thessalonians 4:3-4).
5) Understand the proper meaning of sex and rely on your spouse alone to meet that need (1 Corinthians 7:1-5).
6) Realize that if you walk in the Spirit, you will not fulfill the lusts of the flesh (Galatians 5:16).
7) Take practical steps to reduce your exposure to graphic images.
Install pornography blockers on your computer, limit television and video usage, and find another Christian who will pray for you and help keep you accountable.

 Questions about Sin
                                                                                         Answer
 The first thing to understand in this discussion is that there is only one race—the human race.
Caucasians, Africans, Asians, Indians, Arabs, and Jews are not different races.
Rather, they are different ethnicities of the human race.
All human beings have the same physical characteristics (with minor variations, of course).
More importantly, all human beings are equally created in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27).
God loved the world so much that He sent Jesus to lay down His life for us (John 3:16).
God loved the world so much that He sent Jesus to lay down His life for us (John 3:16).
The “world” obviously includes all ethnic groups.
God does not show partiality or favoritism (Deuteronomy 10:17; Acts 10:34; Romans 2:11; Ephesians 6:9), and neither should we.
James 2:4 describes those who discriminate as “judges with evil thoughts.” Instead, we are to love our neighbors as ourselves (James 2:8).
James 2:4 describes those who discriminate as “judges with evil thoughts.” Instead, we are to love our neighbors as ourselves (James 2:8).
In the Old Testament, God divided humanity into two “racial” groups: Jews and Gentiles.
God’s intent was for the Jews to be a kingdom of priests, ministering to the Gentile nations.
Instead, for the most part, the Jews became proud of their status and despised the Gentiles.
Jesus Christ put an end to this, destroying the dividing wall of hostility (Ephesians 2:14).
All forms of racism, prejudice, and discrimination are affronts to the work of Christ on the cross.
Jesus commands us to love one another as He loves us (John 13:34).
Jesus commands us to love one another as He loves us (John 13:34).
If God is impartial and loves us with impartiality, then we need to love others with that same high standard.
Jesus teaches in Matthew 25 that whatever we do to the least of His brothers, we do to Him.
If we treat a person with contempt, we are mistreating a person created in God’s image; we are hurting somebody whom God loves and for whom Jesus died.
Racism, in varying forms and to various degrees, has been a plague on humanity for thousands of years.
Brothers and sisters of all ethnicities, this should not be.
Those who practice racism, prejudice, and discrimination need to repent.
Ephesians 4:32 declares, “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.” Racists may not deserve your forgiveness, but we deserved God’s forgiveness far less.
Those who practice racism, prejudice, and discrimination need to repent.
“Present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God” (Romans 6:13).
May Galatians 3:28 be completely realized, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”

 There is no Hebrew or Greek word used in the Bible that precisely refers to sex before marriage.
The Bible undeniably condemns adultery and sexual immorality, but is sex before marriage considered sexually immoral?
According to 1 Corinthians 7:2, “yes” is the clear answer: “But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.” In this verse, Paul states that marriage is the “cure” for sexual immorality.
According to 1 Corinthians 7:2, “yes” is the clear answer: “But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.” In this verse, Paul states that marriage is the “cure” for sexual immorality.
Sex before marriage is included in the biblical definition of sexual immorality.
Since 1 Corinthians 7:2 clearly includes sex before marriage in the definition of sexual immorality, all of the Bible verses that condemn sexual immorality as being sinful also condemn sex before marriage as sinful.
Then they can fulfill their passions in a moral way.
Since 1 Corinthians 7:2 clearly includes sex before marriage in the definition of sexual immorality, all of the Bible verses that condemn sexual immorality as being sinful also condemn sex before marriage as sinful.
Sex before marriage is included in the biblical definition of sexual immorality.
There are numerous Scriptures that declare sex before marriage to be a sin (Acts 15:20; 1 Corinthians 5:1; 6:13, 18; 10:8; 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Jude 7).
The Bible promotes complete abstinence before marriage.
Sex between a husband and his wife is the only form of sexual relations of which God approves (Hebrews 13:4).
Far too often we focus on the “recreation” aspect of sex without recognizing that there is another aspect—procreation.
God wants men and women to enjoy sexual activity within the confines of marriage.
God wants men and women to enjoy sexual activity within the confines of marriage.
Song of Solomon and several other Bible passages (such as Proverbs 5:19) clearly describe the pleasure of sex.
However, the couple must understand that God’s intent for sex includes producing children.
While practicality does not determine right from wrong, if the Bible’s message on sex before marriage were obeyed, there would be far fewer sexually transmitted diseases, far fewer abortions, far fewer unwed mothers and unwanted pregnancies, and far fewer children growing up without both parents in their lives.

Abstinence is God’s only policy when it comes to sex before marriage.
Abstinence saves lives, protects babies, gives sexual relations the proper value, and, most importantly, honors God.

 The Bible mentions six specific people who committed suicide: Abimelech (Judges 9:54), Saul (1 Samuel 31:4), Saul’s armor-bearer (1 Samuel 31:4–6), Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17:23), Zimri (1 Kings 16:18), and Judas (Matthew 27:5).
Five of these men were noted for their wickedness (the exception is Saul’s armor-bearer—nothing is said of his character).
Some consider Samson’s death an instance of suicide, because he knew his actions would lead to his death (Judges 16:26–31), but Samson’s goal was to kill Philistines, not himself.
The Bible views suicide as equal to murder, which is what it is—self-murder.
God is the only one who is to decide when and how a person should die.
So, according to the Bible, suicide is a sin.
Suicide, the taking of one’s own life, is ungodly because it rejects God’s gift of life.
So, according to the Bible, suicide is a sin.
Paul learned that, although the pressure he faced was beyond his ability to endure, the Lord can bear all things: “This happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead” (2 Corinthians 1:9).

◦ “Outward adornment” is not as important as the development of the “inner self” and should not be the focus of a Christian (1 Peter 3:3–4).

The New Testament does not say anything about whether or not a believer in Jesus Christ should get a tattoo.
For a minor to get a tattoo in violation of his or her parents’ wishes is biblically unsupportable.

 The Old Testament law commanded the death penalty for various acts: murder (Exodus 21:12), kidnapping (Exodus 21:16), bestiality (Exodus 22:19), adultery (Leviticus 20:10), homosexuality (Leviticus 20:13), being a false prophet (Deuteronomy 13:5), prostitution and rape (Deuteronomy 22:24), and several other crimes.
However, God often showed mercy when the death penalty was due.
David committed adultery and murder, yet God did not demand his life be taken (2 Samuel 11:1-5, 14-17; 2 Samuel 12:13).
Ultimately, every sin we commit should result in the death penalty because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23).
Thankfully, God demonstrates His love for us in not condemning us (Romans 5:8).
When the Pharisees brought a woman who was caught in the act of adultery to Jesus and asked Him if she should be stoned, Jesus replied, “If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her” (John 8:7).
This should not be used to indicate that Jesus rejected capital punishment in all instances.
Jesus was simply exposing the hypocrisy of the Pharisees.
The Pharisees wanted to trick Jesus into breaking the Old Testament law; they did not truly care about the woman being stoned (where was the man who was caught in adultery?)
God is the One who instituted capital punishment: “Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man his blood shall be shed, for in the image of God He made man” (Genesis 9:6).
Jesus would support capital punishment in some instances.
Jesus also demonstrated grace when capital punishment was due (John 8:1-11).
The apostle Paul definitely recognized the power of the government to institute capital punishment where appropriate (Romans 13:1-7).
How should a Christian view the death penalty?
First, we must remember that God has instituted capital punishment in His Word; therefore, it would be presumptuous of us to think that we could institute a higher standard.
God has the highest standard of any being; He is perfect.
This standard applies not only to us but to Himself.
Therefore, He loves to an infinite degree, and He has mercy to an infinite degree.
We also see that He has wrath to an infinite degree, and it is all maintained in a perfect balance.
Second, we must recognize that God has given government the authority to determine when capital punishment is due (Genesis 9:6; Romans 13:1-7).
It is unbiblical to claim that God opposes the death penalty in all instances.
Christians should never rejoice when the death penalty is employed, but at the same time, Christians should not fight against the government’s right to execute the perpetrators of the most evil of crimes.

 In the prosperity gospel, also known as the “Word of Faith Movement,” the believer is told to use God, whereas the truth of biblical Christianity is just the opposite—God uses the believer.
Prosperity theology sees the Holy Spirit as a power to be put to use for whatever the believer wills.
The Bible teaches that the Holy Spirit is a Person who enables the believer to do God’s will.
The prosperity gospel movement closely resembles some of the destructive greed sects that infiltrated the early church.
Paul and the other apostles were not accommodating to or conciliatory with the false teachers who propagated such heresy.
They identified them as dangerous false teachers and urged Christians to avoid them.
Paul warned Timothy about such men in 1 Timothy 6:5, 9-11.
These men of “corrupt mind” supposed godliness was a means of gain and their desire for riches was a trap that brought them “into ruin and destruction” (v. 9).
The pursuit of wealth is a dangerous path for Christians and one which God warns about: “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.
Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs” (v. 10).
If riches were a reasonable goal for the godly, Jesus would have pursued it.
But He did not, preferring instead to have no place to lay His head (Matthew 8:20) and teaching His disciples to do the same.
It should also be remembered that the only disciple concerned with wealth was Judas.
Paul said covetousness is idolatry (Ephesians 5:5) and instructed the Ephesians to avoid anyone who brought a message of immorality or covetousness (Ephesians 5:6-7).
Prosperity teaching prohibits God from working on His own, meaning that God is not Lord of all because He cannot work until we release Him to do so.
Faith, according to the Word of Faith doctrine, is not submissive trust in God; faith is a formula by which we manipulate the spiritual laws that prosperity teachers believe govern the universe.
As the name “Word of Faith” implies, this movement teaches that faith is a matter of what we say more than whom we trust or what truths we embrace and affirm in our hearts.
A favorite term of prosperity gospel teachers is “positive confession.” This refers to the teaching that words themselves have creative power.
What you say, prosperity teachers claim, determines everything that happens to you.
Your confessions, especially the favors you demand of God, must all be stated positively and without wavering.
Then God is required to answer (as though man could require anything of God!).
Thus, God’s ability to bless us supposedly hangs on our faith.
James 4:13-16 clearly contradicts this teaching: “Now listen, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.’ Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow.
What is your life?
You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.” Far from speaking things into existence in the future, we do not even know what tomorrow will bring or even whether we will be alive.
Instead of stressing the importance of wealth, the Bible warns against pursuing it.
Believers, especially leaders in the church (1 Timothy 3:3), are to be free from the love of money (Hebrews 13:5).
The love of money leads to all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6:10).
Jesus warned, “Watch out!
Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions” (Luke 12:15).
In sharp contrast to the prosperity gospel emphasis on gaining money and possessions in this life, Jesus said, “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal” (Matthew 6:19).
The irreconcilable contradictions between prosperity teaching and the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is best summed up in the words of Jesus in Matthew 6:24, “You cannot serve both God and money.”

 Questions about False Doctrine

 Many people make the mistake of reading what the Bible says in Exodus 20:13, “You shall not kill,” and then seeking to apply this command to war.
However, the Hebrew word literally means “the intentional, premeditated killing of another person with malice; murder.” God often ordered the Israelites to go to war with other nations (1 Samuel 15:3; Joshua 4:13).
God ordered the death penalty for numerous crimes (Exodus 21:12, 15; 22:19; Leviticus 20:11).
So, God is not against killing in all circumstances, but only murder.
War is never a good thing, but sometimes it is a necessary thing.
In a world filled with sinful people (Romans 3:10-18), war is inevitable.
Sometimes the only way to keep sinful people from doing great harm to the innocent is by going to war.
In the Old Testament, God ordered the Israelites to “take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites” (Numbers 31:2).
Deuteronomy 20:16-17 declares, “However, in the cities of the nations the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes.
Completely destroy them…as the LORD your God has commanded you.” Also, 1 Samuel 15:18 says, “Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; make war on them until you have wiped them out.” Obviously God is not against all war.
Jesus is always in perfect agreement with the Father (John 10:30), so we cannot argue that war was only God’s will in the Old Testament.
God does not change (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17).
Jesus’ second coming will be exceedingly violent.
Revelation 19:11-21 describes the ultimate war with Christ, the conquering commander who judges and makes war “with justice” (v. 11).
It’s going to be bloody (v. 13) and gory.
The birds will eat the flesh of all those who oppose Him (v. 17-18).
He has no compassion upon His enemies, whom He will conquer completely and consign to a “fiery lake of burning sulfur” (v. 20).
It is an error to say that God never supports a war.
Jesus is not a pacifist.
In a world filled with evil people, sometimes war is necessary to prevent even greater evil.
If Hitler had not been defeated by World War II, how many more millions would have been killed?
If the American Civil War had not been fought, how much longer would African-Americans have had to suffer as slaves?
War is a terrible thing.
Some wars are more “just” than others, but war is always the result of sin (Romans 3:10-18).
At the same time, Ecclesiastes 3:8 declares, “There is…a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.” In a world filled with sin, hatred, and evil (Romans 3:10-18), war is inevitable.
Christians should not desire war, but neither are Christians to oppose the government God has placed in authority over them (Romans 13:1-4; 1 Peter 2:17).
The most important thing we can be doing in a time of war is to be praying for godly wisdom for our leaders, praying for the safety of our military, praying for quick resolution to conflicts, and praying for a minimum of casualties among civilians on both sides (Philippians 4:6-7).

 There is perhaps no more hotly debated issue in the church today than the issue of women serving as pastors.
As a result, it is very important to not see this issue as men versus women.
There are women who believe women should not serve as pastors and that the Bible places restrictions on the ministry of women, and there are men who believe women can serve as pastors and that there are no restrictions on women in ministry.
This is not an issue of chauvinism or discrimination.
It is an issue of biblical interpretation.
The Word of God proclaims, “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent” (1 Timothy 2:11–12).
In the church, God assigns different roles to men and women.
This is a result of the way mankind was created and the way in which sin entered the world (1 Timothy 2:13–14).
This precludes women from serving as pastors over men, which definitely includes preaching to them, teaching them publicly, and exercising spiritual authority over them.
There are many objections to this view of women in pastoral ministry.
A common one is that Paul restricts women from teaching because in the first century, women were typically uneducated.
However, 1 Timothy 2:11–14 nowhere mentions educational status.
If education were a qualification for ministry, then the majority of Jesus’ disciples would not have been qualified.
A second common objection is that Paul only restricted the women of Ephesus from teaching men (1 Timothy was written to Timothy, the pastor of the church in Ephesus).
Ephesus was known for its temple to Artemis, and women were the authorities in that branch of paganism—therefore, the theory goes, Paul was only reacting against the female-led customs of the Ephesian idolaters, and the church needed to be different.
Ephesus was known for its temple to Artemis, and women were the authorities in that branch of paganism—therefore, the theory goes, Paul was only reacting against the female-led customs of the Ephesian idolaters, and the church needed to be different.
However, the book of 1 Timothy nowhere mentions Artemis, nor does Paul mention the standard practice of Artemis worshipers as a reason for the restrictions in 1 Timothy 2:11–12.
A third objection is that Paul is only referring to husbands and wives, not men and women in general.
The Greek words for “woman” and “man” in 1 Timothy 2 could refer to husbands and wives; however, the basic meaning of the words is broader than that.
Further, the same Greek words are used in verses 8–10.
Are only husbands to lift up holy hands in prayer without anger and disputing (verse 8)?
However, the book of 1 Timothy nowhere mentions Artemis, nor does Paul mention the standard practice of Artemis worshipers as a reason for the restrictions in 1 Timothy 2:11–12.
Of course not.
Verses 8–10 clearly refer to all men and women, not just husbands and wives.
There is nothing in the context that would indicate a narrowing to husbands and wives in verses 11–14.
Yet another objection to this interpretation of women in pastoral ministry is in relation to women who held positions of leadership in the Bible, specifically Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah in the Old Testament.
However, the authority of women in the Old Testament is not relevant to the issue of pastors in the church.
In Acts 18, Priscilla and Aquila are presented as faithful ministers for Christ.

In Acts 18, Priscilla and Aquila are presented as faithful ministers for Christ.
However, the authority of women in the Old Testament is not relevant to the issue of pastors in the church.
The New Testament Epistles present a new paradigm for God’s people—the church, the body of Christ—and that paradigm involves an authority structure unique to the church, not for the nation of Israel or any other Old Testament entity.
Similar arguments are made using Priscilla and Phoebe in the New Testament.
In Acts 18, Priscilla and Aquila are presented as faithful ministers for Christ.
Priscilla’s name is mentioned first, perhaps indicating that she was more prominent in ministry than her husband.
As far as we know, Priscilla was not involved in ministry activity in contradiction to 1 Timothy 2:11–14.
Did Priscilla and her husband teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to Apollos?
As far as we know, Priscilla was not involved in ministry activity in contradiction to 1 Timothy 2:11–14.
“Able to teach” is given as a qualification for elders, but not for deacons (1 Timothy 3:1–13; Titus 1:6–9).
In Romans 16:1, Phoebe is called a “deacon” (or “servant”) in the church and is highly commended by Paul.
Verse 13 begins with “for,” giving the “cause” of Paul’s statement in verses 11–12.

Why should women not teach or have authority over men?
Because “Adam was created first, then Eve.
Because “Adam was created first, then Eve.
The order of creation has universal application in the family (Ephesians 5:22–33) and in the church.
The fact that Eve was deceived is also given in 1 Timothy 2:14 as a reason for women not serving as pastors or having spiritual authority over men.
The text simply says that women are not to teach men or have spiritual authority over men because Eve was deceived.
If all women are more easily deceived, why would they be allowed to teach children (who are easily deceived) and other women (who are supposedly more easily deceived)?
This does not mean that women are gullible or that they are all more easily deceived than men.
The text simply says that women are not to teach men or have spiritual authority over men because Eve was deceived.
God has chosen to give men the primary teaching authority in the church.
Many women excel in gifts of hospitality, mercy, teaching, evangelism, and helping/serving.
Much of the ministry of the local church depends on women.
Women in the church are not restricted from public praying or prophesying (1 Corinthians 11:5), only from having spiritual teaching authority over men.
The Bible nowhere restricts women from exercising the gifts of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12).
God has ordained that only men are to serve in positions of spiritual teaching authority in the church.
This is not because men are necessarily better teachers or because women are inferior or less intelligent (which is not the case).
It is simply the way God designed the church to function.
Men are to set the example in spiritual leadership—in their lives and through their words.
Women are to take a less authoritative role.
Women are encouraged to teach other women (Titus 2:3–5).
The Bible also does not restrict women from teaching children.
The only activity women are restricted from is teaching or having spiritual authority over men.
This precludes women from serving as pastors to men.
This does not make women less important, by any means, but rather gives them a ministry focus more in agreement with God’s plan and His gifting of them.

 Within the Christian faith, there is a significant amount of confusion regarding what happens after death.
Some hold that after death, everyone “sleeps” until the final judgment, after which everyone will be sent to heaven or hell.
Others believe that at the moment of death, people are instantly judged and sent to their eternal destinations.
Still others claim that when people die, their souls/spirits are sent to a “temporary” heaven or hell, to await the final resurrection, the final judgment, and then the finality of their eternal destination.
So, what exactly does the Bible say happens after death?
First, for the believer in Jesus Christ, the Bible tells us that after death believers’ souls/spirits are taken to heaven, because their sins are forgiven by having received Christ as Savior (John 3:16, 18, 36).
For believers, death is to be “away from the body and at home with the Lord” (2 Corinthians 5:6-8; Philippians 1:23).
However, passages such as 1 Corinthians 15:50-54 and 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 describe believers being resurrected and given glorified bodies.
If believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, what is the purpose of this resurrection?
It seems that while the souls/spirits of believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, the physical body remains in the grave “sleeping.” At the resurrection of believers, the physical body is resurrected, glorified, and then reunited with the soul/spirit.
It seems that while the souls/spirits of believers go to be with Christ immediately after death, the physical body remains in the grave “sleeping.” At the resurrection of believers, the physical body is resurrected, glorified, and then reunited with the soul/spirit.
This reunited and glorified body-soul-spirit will be the possession of believers for eternity in the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21-22).
Second, for those who do not receive Jesus Christ as Savior, death means everlasting punishment.
However, similar to the destiny of believers, unbelievers also seem to be sent immediately to a temporary holding place, to await their final resurrection, judgment, and eternal destiny.
Luke 16:22-23 describes a rich man being tormented immediately after death.
Revelation 20:11-15 describes all the unbelieving dead being resurrected, judged at the great white throne, and then being cast into the lake of fire.
However, similar to the destiny of believers, unbelievers also seem to be sent immediately to a temporary holding place, to await their final resurrection, judgment, and eternal destiny.
Therefore, after death, a person resides in a “temporary” heaven or hell.
After this temporary realm, at the final resurrection, a person’s eternal destiny will not change.
Revelation 20:11-15 describes all the unbelieving dead being resurrected, judged at the great white throne, and then being cast into the lake of fire.
Therefore, after death, a person resides in a “temporary” heaven or hell.
After this temporary realm, at the final resurrection, a person’s eternal destiny will not change.
The precise “location” of that eternal destiny is what changes.
Believers will ultimately be granted entrance into the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21:1).
After this temporary realm, at the final resurrection, a person’s eternal destiny will not change.
These are the final, eternal destinations of all people—based entirely on whether or not they had trusted Jesus Christ alone for salvation (Matthew 25:46; John 3:36).

It is foolish to debate the fairness of God sending someone to hell who never had the opportunity to hear the gospel of Christ.
 All people are accountable to God whether or not they have “heard about Him.” The Bible tells us that God has clearly revealed Himself in nature (Romans 1:20) and in the hearts of people (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
The problem is that the human race is sinful; we all reject this knowledge of God and rebel against Him (Romans 1:21-23).
Only by accepting God’s grace through the Lord Jesus Christ can people be saved from their sins and rescued from an eternity apart from God.
He does this for those who continually reject Him (Romans 1:24-32).
Rather, the problem is that they have rejected what they have heard and what is readily seen in nature.
Deuteronomy 4:29 proclaims, “But if from there you seek the LORD your God, you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul.” This verse teaches an important principle—everyone who truly seeks after God will find Him.
People are responsible to God for what God has already revealed to them.
The Bible says that people reject this knowledge, and therefore God is just in condemning them to hell.
The problem is “there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God” (Romans 3:11).
People reject the knowledge of God that is present in nature and in their own hearts, and instead decide to worship a “god” of their own creation.
It is foolish to debate the fairness of God sending someone to hell who never had the opportunity to hear the gospel of Christ.
People are responsible to God for what God has already revealed to them.
The Bible says that people reject this knowledge, and therefore God is just in condemning them to hell.
Instead of debating the fate of those who have never heard, we, as Christians, should be doing our best to make sure they do hear.
We are called to spread the gospel throughout the nations (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8).
We know people reject the knowledge of God revealed in nature, and that must motivate us to proclaim the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ.
People are responsible to God for what God has already revealed to them.
If we assume that those who never hear the gospel are granted mercy from God, we lose our motivation for evangelism.
If people who never hear the gospel are automatically saved, then it is logical to make sure no one ever hears the gospel—because then there would be a chance they will reject it and be condemned.

 The Bible says that “Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral" (Hebrews 13:4).

Scripture never says what a husband and wife are or are not allowed to do sexually.
Husbands and wives are instructed, “Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time (1 Corinthians 7:5a).

This verse perhaps lays down the principle for sexual relations in marriage.
Whatever is done, it should be mutually agreed upon.
No one should be encouraged or coerced to do something he or she is uncomfortable with or thinks is wrong.
If a husband and wife both agree that they want to try something (e.g., oral sex, different positions, sex toys, etc.
There are a few things, though, that are never allowable sexually for a married couple.

 A dictionary definition of a Christian would be something similar to “a person professing belief in Jesus as the Christ or in the religion based on the teachings of Jesus.” While this is a good starting point, like many dictionary definitions, it falls somewhat short of really communicating the biblical truth of what it means to be a Christian.
The word “Christian” is used three times in the New Testament (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Peter 4:16).
Followers of Jesus Christ were first called “Christians” in Antioch (Acts 11:26) because their behavior, activity, and speech were like Christ.
The word “Christian” literally means, “belonging to the party of Christ” or a “follower of Christ.”
  Unfortunately over time, the word “Christian” has lost a great deal of its significance and is often used of someone who is religious or has high moral values but who may or may not be a true follower of Jesus Christ.
Many people who do not believe and trust in Jesus Christ consider themselves Christians simply because they go to church or they live in a “Christian” nation.
Going to church does not make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile.
Being a member of a church, attending services regularly, and giving to the work of the church does not make you a Christian.
The Bible teaches that the good works we do cannot make us acceptable to God.
Titus 3:5 says, “He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.
He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.” So, a Christian is someone who has been born again by God (John 3:3; John 3:7; 1 Peter 1:23) and has put faith and trust in Jesus Christ.
He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.” So, a Christian is someone who has been born again by God (John 3:3; John 3:7; 1 Peter 1:23) and has put faith and trust in Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 2:8 tells us that it is “…by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.” 
 A true Christian is a person who has put faith and trust in the person and work of Jesus Christ, including His death on the cross as payment for sins and His resurrection on the third day.
John 1:12 tells us, “Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” The mark of a true Christian is love for others and obedience to God’s Word (1 John 2:4, 10).
John 1:12 tells us, “Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” The mark of a true Christian is love for others and obedience to God’s Word (1 John 2:4, 10).
A true Christian is indeed a child of God, a part of God’s true family, and one who has been given new life in Jesus Christ.

 A “worldview” refers to a comprehensive conception of the world from a specific standpoint.
A “Christian worldview,” then, is a comprehensive conception of the world from a Christian standpoint.
An individual’s worldview is his “big picture,” a harmony of all his beliefs about the world.
It is his way of understanding reality.
One’s worldview is the basis for making daily decisions and is therefore extremely important.
An apple sitting on a table is seen by several people.
A botanist looking at the apple classifies it.
An artist sees a still-life and draws it.
A botanist looking at the apple classifies it.
How we look at any situation is influenced by how we look at the world at large.
Every worldview, Christian and non-Christian, deals with at least these three questions:
Akkamitti jabeessinaa?
A prevalent worldview today is naturalism, which answers the three questions like this: 1) We are the product of random acts of nature with no real purpose.
3) We can save the world through ecology and conservation.
A naturalistic worldview generates many related philosophies such as moral relativism, existentialism, pragmatism, and utopianism.
A Christian worldview, on the other hand, answers the three questions biblically: 1) We are God’s creation, designed to govern the world and fellowship with Him (Genesis 1:27-28; 2:15).
2) We sinned against God and subjected the whole world to a curse (Genesis 3).
3) God Himself has redeemed the world through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ (Genesis 3:15; Luke 19:10), and will one day restore creation to its former perfect state (Isaiah 65:17-25).
A Christian worldview leads us to believe in moral absolutes, miracles, human dignity, and the possibility of redemption.
It is important to remember that a worldview is comprehensive.
It affects every area of life, from money to morality, from politics to art.
True Christianity is more than a set of ideas to use at church.
Christianity as taught in the Bible is itself a worldview.
The Bible never distinguishes between a “religious” and a “secular” life; the Christian life is the only life there is.
Jesus proclaimed Himself “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6) and, in doing so, became our worldview.

 Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God is impossible to be known or proven.
The word “agnostic” essentially means “without knowledge.” Agnosticism is a more intellectually honest form of atheism.
Atheism claims that God does not exist—an unprovable position.
Agnosticism argues that God’s existence cannot be proven or unproven—that it is impossible to know whether or not God exists.
In this, agnosticism is correct.
God’s existence cannot be empirically proven or disproven.
The Bible tells us that we must accept by faith that God exists.
Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith “it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.” God is spirit (John 4:24) so He cannot be seen or touched.
Unless God chooses to reveal Himself, He is invisible to our senses (Romans 1:20).
The Bible declares that the existence of God can be clearly seen in the universe (Psalm 19:1-4), sensed in nature (Romans 1:18-22), and confirmed in our own hearts (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
Agnostics are unwilling to make a decision either for or against God’s existence.
It is the ultimate “straddling the fence” position.
Theists believe that God exists.
Atheists believe that God does not exist.
Agnostics believe that we should not believe or disbelieve in God’s existence, because it is impossible to know either way.
For the sake of argument, let’s throw out the clear and undeniable evidences of God’s existence.
If we put the positions of theism and agnosticism on equal footing, which makes the most “sense” to believe in regards to the possibility of life after death?
If there is no God, theists and agnostics alike all simply cease to exist when they die.
If there is a God, both theists and agnostics will have someone to answer to when they die.
From this perspective, it definitely makes more “sense” to be a theist than an agnostic.
If neither position can be proven or disproven, it seems wise to make every effort to thoroughly examine the position that may have an infinitely and eternally more desirable end result.
It is normal to have doubts.
There are many things in this world that we do not understand.
Often, people doubt God’s existence because they do not understand or agree with the things He does and allows.
However, as finite human beings we should not expect to be able to comprehend an infinite God.
Romans 11:33-34 exclaims, “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
‘Who has known the mind of the Lord?
Or who has been his counselor?’”
 We must believe in God by faith and trust His ways by faith.
God is ready and willing to reveal Himself in amazing ways to those who will believe in Him.
Deuteronomy 4:29 proclaims, “But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find Him if you look for Him with all your heart and with all your soul.”

 Ephesians 5:3 tells us, “But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity...because these are improper for God’s holy people.” Anything that even “hints” of sexual immorality is inappropriate for a Christian.
The Bible does not give us a list of what qualifies as a “hint” or tell us what physical activities are approved for a couple to engage in before marriage.
By essence, foreplay is designed to get one ready for sex.
By essence, foreplay is designed to get one ready for sex.
Anything that can be considered foreplay should be avoided until marriage.
An unmarried couple should avoid any activity that tempts them toward sex, that gives the appearance of immorality, or that could be considered foreplay.
If there is any doubt whatsoever whether an activity is right for an unmarried couple, it should be avoided (Romans 14:23).
Any and all sexual and pre-sexual activity should be restricted to married couples.
An unmarried couple should avoid any activity that tempts them toward sex, that gives the appearance of immorality, or that could be considered foreplay.
Many pastors and Christian counselors strongly advise a couple to not go beyond holding hands, hugging, and light kissing before marriage.
The more a married couple has to share exclusively between themselves, the more special and unique the sexual relationship in that marriage becomes.

 Atheism is the view that God does not exist.
Atheism is not a new development.
Psalm 14:1, written by David around 1000 B.C., mentions atheism: “The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” Recent statistics show an increasing number of people claiming to be atheists, up to 10 percent of people worldwide.
So why are more and more people becoming atheists?
Is atheism truly the logical position atheists claim it to be?
Why does atheism even exist?
Why doesn’t God simply reveal Himself to people, proving that He exists?
Surely if God would just appear, the thinking goes, everyone would believe in Him!
The problem here is that it is not God’s desire to just convince people that He exists.
It is God’s desire for people to believe in Him by faith (2 Peter 3:9) and accept by faith His gift of salvation (John 3:16).
God clearly demonstrated His existence many times in the Old Testament (Genesis 6-9; Exodus 14:21-22; 1 Kings 18:19-31).
Did the people believe that God exists?
Yes.
Did they turn from their evil ways and obey God?
No.
If a person is not willing to accept God’s existence by faith, then he/she is definitely not ready to accept Jesus Christ as Savior by faith (Ephesians 2:8-9).
God’s desire is for people to become Christians, not just theists (those who believe God exists).
The Bible tells us that God’s existence must be accepted by faith.
Hebrews 11:6 declares, “And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him.” The Bible reminds us that we are blessed when we believe and trust in God by faith: “Then Jesus told him, ‘Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed’” (John 20:29).
The existence of God must be accepted by faith, but this does not mean belief in God is illogical.
There are many good arguments for the existence of God.
The Bible teaches that God’s existence is clearly seen in the universe (Psalm 19:1-4), in nature (Romans 1:18-22), and in our own hearts (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
With all that said, the existence of God cannot be proven; it must be accepted by faith.
At the same time, it takes just as much faith to believe in atheism.
To make the absolute statement “God does not exist” is to make a claim of knowing absolutely everything there is to know about everything and of having been everywhere in the universe and having witnessed everything there is to be seen.
Of course, no atheist would make these claims.
However, that is essentially what they are claiming when they state that God absolutely does not exist.
Atheists cannot prove that God does not, for example, live in the center of the sun, or beneath the clouds of Jupiter, or in some distant nebula.
Since those places are beyond our capacity to observe, it cannot be proven that God does not exist.
It takes just as much faith to be an atheist as it does to be a theist.
Atheism cannot be proven, and God’s existence must be accepted by faith.
Obviously, Christians believe strongly that God exists, and admit that God’s existence is a matter of faith.
At the same time, we reject the idea that belief in God is illogical.
We believe that God’s existence can be clearly seen, keenly sensed, and proven to be philosophically and scientifically necessary.
“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge.
There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.
Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world” (Psalm 19:1-4).

Jesus died for our sins, was buried, was resurrected, and thereby offers salvation to all who will receive Him in faith.
Unique among all other faiths, Christianity is more about a relationship than religious practices.
Instead of adhering to a list of “do’s and don’ts,” the goal of a Christian is to cultivate a close walk with God.
That relationship is made possible because of the work of Jesus Christ and the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
Beyond these core beliefs, there are many other items that are, or at least should be, indicative of what Christianity is and what Christians believe.
Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired, “God-breathed” Word of God and that its teaching is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
Christians believe in one God that exists in three persons—the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.
Christians believe in one God that exists in three persons—the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.
Christians believe in one God that exists in three persons—the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.
Christians believe that mankind was created specifically to have a relationship with God, but sin separates all men from God (Romans 3:23; 5:12).
Christians believe that after His death, Christ was buried, He rose again, and now lives at the right hand of the Father, making intercession for the believers forever (Hebrews 7:25).
Christianity proclaims that Jesus’ death on the cross was sufficient to completely pay the sin debt owed by all men and this is what restores the broken relationship between God and man (Hebrews 9:11-14; 10:10; Romans 5:8; 6:23).
Christianity teaches that in order to be saved and be granted entrance into heaven after death, one must place one’s faith entirely in the finished work of Christ on the cross.
If we believe that Christ died in our place and paid the price of our own sins, and rose again, then we are saved.
There is nothing that anyone can do to earn salvation.
We cannot be “good enough” to please God on our own, because we are all sinners (Isaiah 53:6; 64:6-7).
There is nothing more to be done, because Christ has done all the work!
When He was on the cross, Jesus said, “It is finished” (John 19:30), meaning that the work of redemption was completed.
When He was on the cross, Jesus said, “It is finished” (John 19:30), meaning that the work of redemption was completed.
According to Christianity, salvation is freedom from the old sin nature and freedom to pursue a right relationship with God.
Where we were once slaves to sin, we are now slaves to Christ (Romans 6:15-22).
As long as believers live on this earth in their sinful bodies, they will engage in a constant struggle with sin.
However, Christians can have victory in the struggle with sin by studying and applying God’s Word in their lives and being controlled by the Holy Spirit—that is, submitting to the Spirit’s leading in everyday circumstances.
So, while many religious systems require that a person do or not do certain things, Christianity is about believing that Christ died on the cross as payment for our own sins and rose again.
Our sin debt is paid and we can have fellowship with God.
We can have victory over our sin nature and walk in fellowship and obedience with God.
We can have victory over our sin nature and walk in fellowship and obedience with God.
That is true biblical Christianity.

Dispensationalism has two primary distinctives: 1) a consistently literal interpretation of Scripture, especially Bible prophecy, and 2) a view of the uniqueness of Israel as separate from the Church in God’s program.

The literal interpretation gives each word the meaning it would commonly have in everyday usage.
It is understood that even symbols and figurative sayings have literal meanings behind them.
It is understood that even symbols and figurative sayings have literal meanings behind them.
There are at least two reasons why literalism is the best way to view Scripture.
First, philosophically, the purpose of language itself requires that we interpret words literally.
Language was given by God for the purpose of being able to communicate.
The second reason is biblical.
Every prophecy about Jesus Christ in the Old Testament was fulfilled literally.
Jesus’ birth, ministry, death, and resurrection all occurred exactly as the Old Testament predicted.
The prophecies were literal.
This argues strongly for the literal method.
If a literal interpretation is not used in studying the Scriptures, there is no objective standard by which to understand the Bible.
Each person would be able to interpret the Bible as he saw fit.
Biblical interpretation would devolve into “what this passage says to me” instead of “the Bible says.” Sadly, this is already the case in much of what is called Bible study today.
Each person would be able to interpret the Bible as he saw fit.
Dispensational theology teaches that there are two distinct peoples of God: Israel and the Church.
Dispensationalists believe that salvation has always been by grace through faith alone—in God in the Old Testament and specifically in God the Son in the New Testament.
Dispensationalists hold that the Church has not replaced Israel in God’s program and that the Old Testament promises to Israel have not been transferred to the Church.
Dispensationalists believe that, just as God is in this age focusing His attention on the Church, He will again in the future focus His attention on Israel (see Romans 9–11 and Daniel 9:24).
Dispensationalists understand the Bible to be organized into seven dispensations: Innocence (Genesis 1:1—3:7), Conscience (Genesis 3:8—8:22), Human Government (Genesis 9:1—11:32), Promise (Genesis 12:1—Exodus 19:25), Law (Exodus 20:1—Acts 2:4), Grace (Acts 2:4—Revelation 20:3), and the Millennial Kingdom (Revelation 20:4–6).
Dispensationalism, as a system, results in a premillennial interpretation of Christ’s second coming and usually a pretribulational interpretation of the rapture.
The prophecies were literal.
To summarize, dispensationalism is a theological system that emphasizes the literal interpretation of Bible prophecy, recognizes a distinction between Israel and the Church, and organizes the Bible into different dispensations or administrations.

 The Bible has a lot to say about the end times.
Nearly every book of the Bible contains prophecy regarding the end times.
Taking all of these prophecies and organizing them can be difficult.
Following is a very brief summary of what the Bible declares will happen in the end times.
Christ will remove all born-again believers from the earth in an event known as the rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-54).
At the judgment seat of Christ, these believers will be rewarded for good works and faithful service during their time on earth or will lose rewards, but not eternal life, for lack of service and obedience (1 Corinthians 3:11-15; 2 Corinthians 5:10).
The Antichrist (the beast) will come into power and will sign a covenant with Israel for seven years (Daniel 9:27).
This seven-year period of time is known as the “tribulation.” During the tribulation, there will be terrible wars, famines, plagues, and natural disasters.
God will be pouring out His wrath against sin, evil, and wickedness.
The tribulation will include the appearance of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the seven seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments.
About halfway through the seven years, the Antichrist will break the peace covenant with Israel and make war against it.
The Antichrist will commit “the abomination of desolation” and set up an image of himself to be worshiped in the Jerusalem temple (Daniel 9:27; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-10), which will have been rebuilt.
The second half of the tribulation is known as “the great tribulation” (Revelation 7:14) and “the time of Jacob’s trouble” (Jeremiah 30:7).
At the end of the seven-year tribulation, the Antichrist will launch a final attack on Jerusalem, culminating in the battle of Armageddon.
Jesus Christ will return, destroy the Antichrist and his armies, and cast them into the lake of fire (Revelation 19:11-21).
Christ will then bind Satan in the Abyss for 1,000 years and He will rule His earthly kingdom for this thousand-year period (Revelation 20:1-6).
At the end of the thousand years, Satan will be released, defeated again, and then cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:7-10) for eternity.
Christ then judges all unbelievers (Revelation 20:10-15) at the great white throne judgment, casting them all into the lake of fire.
Christ will then usher in a new heaven and new earth and the New Jerusalem—the eternal dwelling place of believers.
There will be no more sin, sorrow, or death (Revelation 21–22).

 Questions about the End Times

 The Mormon religion (Mormonism), whose followers are known as Mormons and Latter-day Saints (LDS), was founded less than two hundred years ago by a man named Joseph Smith.
He claimed to have received a personal visit from God the Father and Jesus Christ (Articles of Faith, p. 35) who told him that all churches and their creeds were an abomination (1 Nephi 13:28; Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith – History 1:18, 19).
Joseph Smith then set out to "restore true Christianity" and claimed his church to be the “only true church on earth” (Mormon Doctrine, p. 670; 1 Nephi 14:10).
The problem with Mormonism is that it contradicts, modifies, and expands on the Bible.
Christians do not have a reason to believe that the Bible is untrue or inadequate.
To truly believe in and trust God means to believe in His Word, and all Scripture is inspired by God, which means it comes from Him (2 Timothy 3:16).
Mormons believe that there are in fact four sources of divinely inspired words, not just one: 1) the Bible “as far as it is translated correctly” (8th Article of Faith).
Which verses are considered incorrectly translated is not always made clear.
2) The Book of Mormon, which was “translated” by Smith and published in 1830.
Smith claimed it is the “most correct book” on earth and that a person can get closer to God by following its precepts “than by any other book” (History of the Church 4:461).
3) Doctrine and Covenants, containing a collection of modern revelations regarding the “Church of Jesus Christ as it has been restored.” 4) The Pearl of Great Price, which is considered by Mormons to “clarify” doctrines and teachings that were lost from the Bible (Articles of Faith, p. 182–185) and adds its own information about the earth’s creation.
Mormons believe the following about God: He has not always been the Supreme Being of the universe (Mormon Doctrine, p. 321) but attained that status through righteous living and persistent effort (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 345).
They believe God the Father has a “body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s” (Doctrine and Covenants 130:22).
Brigham Young taught that Adam actually was God and the father of Jesus Christ—although this teaching has been abandoned by modern Mormon leaders.
In contrast, Christians know this about God: there is only one true God (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10; 44:6–8).
He always has existed and always will exist (Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2; 1 Timothy 1:17).
He was not created but is the Creator (Genesis 1; Psalm 24:1; Isaiah 37:16).
He is perfect, and no one else is equal to Him (Psalm 86:8; Isaiah 40:25).
God the Father is not a man, nor was He ever (Numbers 23:19; 1 Samuel 15:29; Hosea 11:9).
He is Spirit (John 4:24), and Spirit is not made of flesh and bone (Luke 24:39).
Mormons believe that there are different levels or kingdoms in the afterlife: the celestial kingdom, the terrestrial kingdom, the telestial kingdom, and outer darkness (Mormon Doctrine, p. 348).
Where mankind will end up depends on what they believe and do in this life (2 Nephi 25:23; Articles of Faith, p.79).
In contrast, the Bible tells us that after death we go to heaven or hell based on whether or not we had faith in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior.
To be absent from our bodies means, as believers, we are with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:6–8).
Unbelievers are sent to hell or the place of the dead (Luke 16:22–23).
When Jesus comes the second time, we will receive resurrected, glorified bodies (1 Corinthians 15:50–54).
There will be a new heaven and new earth for believers (Revelation 21:1), and unbelievers will be thrown into an everlasting lake of fire (Revelation 20:11–15).
There is no second chance for redemption after death (Hebrews 9:27).
Mormon leaders have taught that Jesus’ incarnation was the result of a physical relationship between God the Father and Mary (Journal of Discourses, vol.
8, p. 115; Mormon Doctrine, p. 547).
Mormons believe Jesus is a god, but that any human can also become a god (Doctrine and Covenants 132:20; Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 345–354).
Mormonism teaches that salvation can be earned by a combination of faith and good works (LDS Bible Dictionary, p. 697).
Contrary to this, Christians historically have taught that no one can achieve the status of God—only He is holy (1 Samuel 2:2).
We can only be made holy in God’s sight through faith in Him (1 Corinthians 1:2).
Jesus is the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16), is the only one ever to have lived a sinless life, and now has the highest place of honor in heaven (Hebrews 7:26).
Jesus and God are one in essence, Jesus being the only man who existed before physical birth (John 1:1–8; 8:56).
Jesus gave Himself to us as a sacrifice, God raised Him from the dead, and one day everyone will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Philippians 2:6–11).
Jesus tells us it is impossible to get to heaven by our own works and that only by faith in Him is it possible (Matthew 19:26).
We all deserve eternal punishment for our sins, but God’s infinite love and grace have allowed us a way out.
“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).
Clearly, there is only one way to receive salvation and that is to know God and His Son, Jesus (John 17:3).
Receiving salvation is not done by works but by faith (Romans 1:17; 3:28).
We can receive this gift no matter who we are or what we have done (Romans 3:22).
“Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).
Although Mormons are usually friendly, loving, and kind people, they are deceived by a false religion that distorts the nature of God, the Person of Jesus Christ, and the means of salvation.
(Editor’s note: many of the references in our articles on Mormonism are Mormon publications, such as Mormon Doctrine, Articles of Faith, Doctrines of Salvation, History of the Church, Doctrine and Covenants, and so forth.
Others are from the Book of Mormon itself, e.g., books such as 1 Nephi, 2 Nephi, and Alma.)

 Romans 8:29-30 tells us, “For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
However, predestination is a biblical doctrine.
However, predestination is a biblical doctrine.
The words translated “predestined” in the Scriptures referenced above are from the Greek word proorizo, which carries the meaning of “determining beforehand,” “ordaining,” “deciding ahead of time.” So, predestination is God determining certain things to occur ahead of time.
Predestination is the biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved.
However, predestination is a biblical doctrine.
According to Romans 8:29-30, God predetermined that certain individuals would be conformed to the likeness of His Son, be called, justified, and glorified.
Essentially, God predetermines that certain individuals will be saved.
Predestination is the biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved.
Numerous scriptures refer to believers in Christ being chosen (Matthew 24:22, 31; Mark 13:20, 27; Romans 8:33, 9:11, 11:5-7, 28; Ephesians 1:11; Colossians 3:12; 1 Thessalonians 1:4; 1 Timothy 5:21; 2 Timothy 2:10; Titus 1:1; 1 Peter 1:1-2, 2:9; 2 Peter 1:10).
Predestination is the biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved.
The most common objection to the doctrine of predestination is that it is unfair.
Why would God choose certain individuals and not others?
The important thing to remember is that no one deserves to be saved.
We have all sinned (Romans 3:23) and are all worthy of eternal punishment (Romans 6:23).
As a result, God would be perfectly just in allowing all of us to spend eternity in hell.
However, God chooses to save some of us.
He is not being unfair to those who are not chosen, because they are receiving what they deserve.
God’s choosing to be gracious to some is not unfair to the others.
As a result, God would be perfectly just in allowing all of us to spend eternity in hell.
An illustration would be a man randomly handing out money to five people in a crowd of twenty.
Would the fifteen people who did not receive money be upset?
Probably so.
Do they have a right to be upset?
No, they do not.
Why?
Because the man did not owe anyone money.
He simply decided to be gracious to some.
God predestines who will be saved, and we must choose Christ in order to be saved.
God predestines who will be saved, and we must choose Christ in order to be saved.
The Bible never describes God rejecting anyone who believes in Him or turning away anyone who is seeking Him (Deuteronomy 4:29).
Somehow, in the mystery of God, predestination works hand-in-hand with a person being drawn by God (John 6:44) and believing unto salvation (Romans 1:16).
Somehow, in the mystery of God, predestination works hand-in-hand with a person being drawn by God (John 6:44) and believing unto salvation (Romans 1:16).
God predestines who will be saved, and we must choose Christ in order to be saved.
Both facts are equally true.
Romans 11:33 proclaims, “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!”

 Premillennialism is the view that Christ’s second coming will occur prior to His millennial kingdom, and that the millennial kingdom is a literal 1000-year reign of Christ on earth.
In order to understand and interpret the passages in Scripture that deal with end-times events, there are two things that must be clearly understood: a proper method of interpreting Scripture and the distinction between Israel (the Jews) and the church (the body of all believers in Jesus Christ).
First, a proper method of interpreting Scripture requires that Scripture be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its context.
First, a proper method of interpreting Scripture requires that Scripture be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its context.
It is critical to know the author, intended audience, and historical background of each passage one interprets.
The historical and cultural setting will often reveal the correct meaning of a passage.
It is also important to remember that Scripture interprets Scripture.
That is, often a passage will cover a topic or subject that is also addressed elsewhere in the Bible.
It is important to interpret all of these passages consistently with one another.
Finally, and most importantly, passages must always be taken in their normal, regular, plain, literal meaning unless the context of the passage indicates that it is figurative in nature.
A literal interpretation does not eliminate the possibility of figures of speech being used.
Rather, it encourages the interpreter to not read figurative language into the meaning of a passage unless it is appropriate for that context.
It is crucial to never seek a “deeper, more spiritual” meaning than is presented.
Spiritualizing a passage is dangerous because it moves the basis for accurate interpretation from Scripture to the mind of the reader.
Then, there can be no objective standard of interpretation; instead, Scripture becomes subject to each person’s own impression of what it means.
Second Peter 1:20-21 reminds us that “no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation.
 Applying these principles of biblical interpretation, it must be seen that Israel (Abraham’s physical descendants) and the church (all New Testament believers) are two distinct groups.
It is crucial to recognize that Israel and the church are distinct because, if this is misunderstood, Scripture will be misinterpreted.
Especially prone to misinterpretation are passages that deal with promises made to Israel (both fulfilled and unfulfilled).
Such promises should not be applied to the church.
Remember, the context of the passage will determine to whom it is addressed and will point to the most correct interpretation.
With those concepts in mind, we can look at various passages of Scripture that produce the premillennial view.
Genesis 12:1-3: “The LORD had said to Abram, ‘Leave your country, your people and your father’s household and go to the land I will show you.
I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
That is, there was nothing Abraham could do or fail to do that would void the covenant God made.
In Genesis 15:9-17, God ratifies His covenant with Abraham.
That is, there was nothing Abraham could do or fail to do that would void the covenant God made.
Also in this passage, the boundaries are set for the land that the Jews will eventually occupy.
For a detailed list of the boundaries, see Deuteronomy 34.
Other passages that deal with the promise of land are Deuteronomy 30:3-5 and Ezekiel 20:42-44.
In 2 Samuel 7:10-17, we see the promise made by God to King David.
Also, 2 Samuel 7 says that God would establish a king who would rule for eternity.
Therefore, this is a promise that has yet to be fulfilled.
Some would believe that the rule of Solomon was the literal fulfillment of this prophecy, but there is a problem with that.
The territory over which Solomon ruled is not held by Israel today, and neither does Solomon rule over Israel today.
Remember that God promised Abraham that his descendants would possess a land forever.
Also, 2 Samuel 7 says that God would establish a king who would rule for eternity.
Solomon could not be a fulfillment of the promise made to David.
Therefore, this is a promise that has yet to be fulfilled.
Now, with all this in mind, examine what is recorded in Revelation 20:1-7.
The thousand years which is repeatedly mentioned in this passage corresponds to Christ’s literal 1000-year reign on the earth.
Recall that the promise made to David regarding a ruler had to be fulfilled literally and has not yet taken place.
Premillennialism sees this passage as describing the future fulfillment of that promise with Christ on the throne.
God made unconditional covenants with both Abraham and David.
Neither of these covenants has been fully or permanently fulfilled.
A literal, physical rule of Christ is the only way the covenants can be fulfilled as God promised they would.
Applying a literal method of interpretation to Scripture results in the pieces of the puzzle coming together.
All of the Old Testament prophecies of Jesus’ first coming were fulfilled literally.
Therefore, we should expect the prophecies regarding His second coming to be fulfilled literally as well.
Premillennialism is the only system that agrees with a literal interpretation of God’s covenants and end-times prophecy.

 Spiritual growth is the process of becoming more and more like Jesus Christ.
When we place our faith in Jesus, the Holy Spirit begins the process of making us more like Him, conforming us to His image.
Spiritual growth is perhaps best described in 2 Peter 1:3-8, which tells us that by God’s power we have “everything we need” to live lives of godliness, which is the goal of spiritual growth.
Notice that what we need comes “through our knowledge of Him,” which is the key to obtaining everything we need.
Our knowledge of Him comes from the Word, given to us for our edification and growth.
There are two lists in Galatians 5:19-23.
Verses 19-21 list the “acts of the flesh.” These are the things that identified our lives before we came to Christ for salvation.
These are what should characterize our lives now that we have experienced salvation in Jesus Christ.
The acts of the flesh are the activities we are to confess, repent of, and, with God’s help, overcome.
As we experience spiritual growth, fewer and fewer of the “acts of the flesh” will be evident in our lives.
We are new creatures in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17).
The second list is the “fruit of the Spirit” (verses 22-23).
These are what should characterize our lives now that we have experienced salvation in Jesus Christ.
Spiritual growth is identified by the fruit of the Spirit becoming increasingly evident in a believer’s life.
When the transformation of salvation takes place, spiritual growth begins.
When the transformation of salvation takes place, spiritual growth begins.
We are new creatures in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17).
Spiritual growth is a lifelong process that depends on our study and application of God’s Word (2 Timothy 3:16-17) and our walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16-26).
As we seek spiritual growth, we should pray to God and ask for wisdom concerning the areas He desires us to grow in.
We can ask God to increase our faith and knowledge of Him.
God desires for us to grow spiritually, and He has given us all we need to experience spiritual growth.
With the Holy Spirit’s help, we can overcome sin and steadily become more like our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

 “Systematic” refers to something being put into a system.
Systematic theology is, therefore, the division of theology into systems that explain its various areas.
For example, many books of the Bible give information about the angels.
No one book gives all the information about the angels.
Systematic theology takes all the information about angels from all the books of the Bible and organizes it into a system called angelology.
That is what systematic theology is all about—organizing the teachings of the Bible into categorical systems.
Hamartiology is the study of sin.
Systematic theology is an important tool in helping us to understand and teach the Bible in an organized manner.
In addition to systematic theology, there are other ways that theology can be divided.
Biblical theology is the study of a certain book (or books) of the Bible and emphasizing the different aspects of theology it focuses on.
For example, the Gospel of John is very Christological since it focuses so much on the deity of Christ (John 1:1, 14; 8:58; 10:30; 20:28).
Historical theology is the study of doctrines and how they have developed over the centuries of the Christian church.
Dogmatic theology is the study of the doctrines of certain Christian groups that have systematized doctrine—for example, Calvinistic theology and dispensational theology.
Contemporary theology is the study of doctrines that have developed or come into focus in recent times.
No matter what method of theology is studied, what is important is that theology is studied.

 On some topics, the Bible is extremely clear.
For example, our moral obligations toward God and the method of salvation are discussed in detail.
On other topics, however, the Bible doesn’t provide nearly as much information.
 On some topics, the Bible is extremely clear.
In other words, “the main things are the plain things.” One of the topics not explicitly addressed in Scripture is the age of the earth.
There are several ways of attempting to determine the age of the earth.
Every method relies on certain assumptions which may or may not be accurate.
All fall in a spectrum between biblical literalism and scientific literalism.
One method of determining the age of the earth assumes that the six days of creation presented in Genesis 1 were literal 24-hour periods and that there are no gaps in the chronology or genealogy of Genesis.
The years listed in the genealogies of Genesis are then added to get an approximate time from creation to certain Old Testament figures.
It’s important to realize that the Bible nowhere explicitly states the age of the earth—this is a calculated number.
Another method of determining the age of the earth is to use resources such as radiometric (carbon) dating, geologic cycles, and so forth.
By comparing different methods, and seeing if they align, scientists attempt to determine how old the planet is.
This is the method used to arrive at an age for Earth of about 4 to 5 billion years.
It’s important to realize that the Bible nowhere explicitly states the age of the earth—this is a calculated number.
There are theologians who do not believe that the Bible’s text requires the creation days to be literal 24-hour periods.
The years listed in the genealogies of Genesis are then added to get an approximate time from creation to certain Old Testament figures.
Some measures of the age of Earth do not seem to support it being as young as 6,000 years, and denying such evidence requires the suggestion that God made virtually every aspect of the universe “appear” to be old, for some reason.
On the other hand, radiometric dating is only useful or accurate back to a certain point, far less than the scale involved in dating the earth.
Geologic time scales, fossil records, and so forth are highly dependent on assumptions and subject to modeling errors.
The same is true of observations of the greater universe; we can only see a tiny fraction of all that exists, and much of what we “know” is theoretical.
The same is true of observations of the greater universe; we can only see a tiny fraction of all that exists, and much of what we “know” is theoretical.
In short, there are ample reasons to believe that secular estimates for the age of the earth are inaccurate, as well.
Relying on science to answer scientific questions is fine, but science cannot be treated as infallible.
Despite claims to the contrary, many Christians who hold to an old earth view take the Bible to be infallible and inspired, but they differ on the proper interpretation of a select few verses.

Got Questions Ministries favors the young earth perspective.
In the end, the chronological age of the earth cannot be proven.
We believe that Genesis 1–2 is literal, and young earth creationism is what a literal reading of those chapters presents.
In short, there are ample reasons to believe that secular estimates for the age of the earth are inaccurate, as well.
We need not question the faith of our brothers and sisters in Christ who disagree with us about the age of the earth.
We believe one can hold to old earth creationism and still adhere to the core doctrines of the Christian faith.
Topics such as the age of the earth are why Paul urged believers not to cause strife over things not detailed in the Bible (Romans 14:1–10; Titus 3:9).
Thousands not Billions by Don DeYoung
Topics such as the age of the earth are why Paul urged believers not to cause strife over things not detailed in the Bible (Romans 14:1–10; Titus 3:9).
The age of the earth is not “plain” in the Scriptures.
It is also not “main,” in that one’s view of Earth’s age has no necessary implications for one’s view of sin, salvation, morality, heaven, or hell.
We can know much about who created, why He created, and how we are meant to relate to Him, but the Bible does not tell us in unambiguous terms exactly when He created.
At the same time, we do not consider old earth creationism to be heretical.

 The baptism of the Holy Spirit may be defined as that work whereby the Spirit of God places the believer into union with Christ and into union with other believers in the body of Christ at the moment of salvation.
First Corinthians 12:12–13 is the central passage in the Bible regarding the baptism of the Holy Spirit: “For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink” (1 Corinthians 12:13).
While Romans 6:1–4 does not mention specifically the Spirit of God, it does describe the believer’s position before God in language similar to the 1 Corinthians passage: “What shall we say, then?
By no means!
We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?
Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”
 The following facts are necessary to help solidify our understanding of Spirit baptism: First, 1 Corinthians 12:13 clearly states that all have been baptized, just as all been given the Spirit to drink (the indwelling of the Spirit).
Second, nowhere in Scripture are believers told to be baptized with, in or by the Spirit, or in any sense to seek the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
This indicates that all believers have had this experience.
Third, Ephesians 4:5 seems to refer to Spirit baptism.
If this is the case, Spirit baptism is the reality for every believer, just as “one faith” and “one Father” are.
In conclusion, the baptism of the Holy Spirit does two things, 1) it joins us to the body of Christ, and 2) it actualizes our co-crucifixion with Christ.
While Romans 6:1–4 does not mention specifically the Spirit of God, it does describe the believer’s position before God in language similar to the 1 Corinthians passage: “What shall we say, then?
We should then exercise our spiritual gifts to keep that body functioning properly as stated in the context of 1 Corinthians 12:13.
Experiencing the one Spirit baptism serves as the basis for keeping the unity of the church, as in the context of Ephesians 4:5.
Being associated with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection through Spirit baptism establishes the basis for our separation from the power of indwelling sin and our walk in newness of life (Romans 6:1-10; Colossians 2:12).

 The most important thing we can do for those involved in cults or false religions is pray for them.
We need to pray that God would change their hearts and open their eyes to the truth (2 Corinthians 4:4).
We need to pray that God would convince them of their need for salvation through Jesus Christ (John 3:16).
Without the power of God and conviction of the Holy Spirit, we will never succeed in convincing anyone of the truth (John 16:7-11).
We also need to be living a godly Christian life, so those trapped in cults and religions can see the change God has made in our own lives (1 Peter 3:1-2).
We need to pray for wisdom in how we can minister to them in a powerful way (James 1:5).
After all of this, we must be bold in our actual sharing of the gospel.
We must proclaim the message of salvation through Jesus Christ (Romans 10:9-10).
We always need to be prepared to defend our faith (1 Peter 3:15), but we must do so with gentleness and respect.
We can proclaim the doctrine correctly, win the war of words, and still impede the cause by an attitude of angry superiority.
Ultimately, we must leave the salvation of those to whom we witness up to God.
It is God’s power and grace that saves people, not our efforts.
While it is good and wise to be prepared to give a vigorous defense and have knowledge of false beliefs, neither of these things will result in the conversion of those trapped in the lies of the cults and false religions.
The best we can do is pray for them, witness to them, and live the Christian life in front of them, trusting that the Holy Spirit will do the work of drawing, convincing, and converting.

 The concept of “blasphemy against the Spirit” is mentioned in Mark 3:22–30 and Matthew 12:22–32.
The term blasphemy may be generally defined as “defiant irreverence.” The term can be applied to such sins as cursing God or willfully degrading things relating to God.
The term blasphemy may be generally defined as “defiant irreverence.” The term can be applied to such sins as cursing God or willfully degrading things relating to God.
A demon-possessed man was brought to Jesus, and the Lord cast the demon out, healing the man of blindness and muteness.
This particular case of blasphemy, however, is called “the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” in Matthew 12:31.
The Pharisees, having witnessed irrefutable proof that Jesus was working miracles in the power of the Holy Spirit, claimed instead that the Lord was possessed by a demon (Matthew 12:24).
Notice in Mark 3:30 Jesus is very specific about what the Pharisees did to commit blasphemy against the Holy Spirit: “He said this because they were saying, ‘He has an impure spirit.’”
 Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has to do with accusing Jesus Christ of being demon-possessed instead of Spirit-filled.
This particular type of blasphemy cannot be duplicated today.
Jesus Christ is not on earth—He is seated at the right hand of God.
No one can personally witness Jesus performing a miracle and then attribute that power to Satan instead of the Spirit.
No one can personally witness Jesus performing a miracle and then attribute that power to Satan instead of the Spirit.
The unpardonable sin today is the state of continued unbelief.
Jesus declared their willful blindness to be unpardonable.
 Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has to do with accusing Jesus Christ of being demon-possessed instead of Spirit-filled.
The love of God is evident: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
And the choice is clear: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on him” (John 3:36).
To resist that conviction and willfully remain unrepentant is to “blaspheme” the Spirit.

It appears innocent at first, but soon people can find themselves addicted to psychics and unwittingly allow Satan to control and destroy their lives.

 Many people today understand the church as a building.
This is not a biblical understanding of the church.
The word “church” is a translation of the Greek word ekklesia, which is defined as “an assembly” or “called-out ones.” The root meaning of church is not that of a building, but of people.

It is ironic that when you ask people what church they attend, they usually identify a building.
Romans 16:5 says, “Greet the church that is in their house.” Paul refers to the church in their house—not a church building, but a body of believers.

Ephesians 1:22–23 says, “And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.” The body of Christ is made up of all believers in Jesus Christ from the day of Pentecost (Acts 2) until Christ’s return.

Local churches are gatherings of people who claim the name of Christ.
Members of the universal church should seek fellowship and edification in a local church.
In summary, the church is not a building or a denomination.
According to the Bible, the church is the body of Christ—all those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ for salvation (John 3:16; 1 Corinthians 12:13).
The local church is where believers can fully apply the “body” principles of 1 Corinthians chapter 12—encouraging, teaching, and building one another up in the knowledge and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.

 Sin is described in the Bible as transgression of the law of God (1 John 3:4) and rebellion against God (Deuteronomy 9:7; Joshua 1:18).
Sin had its beginning with Lucifer, probably the most beautiful and powerful of the angels.
Not content with his position, he desired to be higher than God, and that was his downfall, the beginning of sin (Isaiah 14:12-15).
Renamed Satan, he brought sin to the human race in the Garden of Eden, where he tempted Adam and Eve with the same enticement, “you shall be like God.” Genesis 3 describes Adam and Eve’s rebellion against God and against His command.
Since that time, sin has been passed down through all the generations of mankind and we, Adam’s descendants, have inherited sin from him.
Romans 5:12 tells us that through Adam sin entered the world, and so death was passed on to all men because “the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).
Through Adam, the inherent inclination to sin entered the human race, and human beings became sinners by nature.
When Adam sinned, his inner nature was transformed by his sin of rebellion, bringing to him spiritual death and depravity which would be passed on to all who came after him.
We are sinners not because we sin; rather, we sin because we are sinners.
This passed-on depravity is known as inherited sin.
Just as we inherit physical characteristics from our parents, we inherit our sinful natures from Adam.
King David lamented this condition of fallen human nature in Psalm 51:5: “Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.”
 Another type of sin is known as imputed sin.
Used in both financial and legal settings, the Greek word translated “imputed” means “to take something that belongs to someone and credit it to another’s account.” Before the Law of Moses was given, sin was not imputed to man, although men were still sinners because of inherited sin.
After the Law was given, sins committed in violation of the Law were imputed (accounted) to them (Romans 5:13).
Even before transgressions of the law were imputed to men, the ultimate penalty for sin (death) continued to reign (Romans 5:14).
All humans, from Adam to Moses, were subject to death, not because of their sinful acts against the Mosaic Law (which they did not have), but because of their own inherited sinful nature.
After Moses, humans were subject to death both because of inherited sin from Adam and imputed sin from violating the laws of God.
God used the principle of imputation to benefit mankind when He imputed the sin of believers to the account of Jesus Christ, who paid the penalty for that sin—death—on the cross.
Imputing our sin to Jesus, God treated Him as if He were a sinner, though He was not, and had Him die for the sins of the entire world (1 John 2:2).
It is important to understand that sin was imputed to Him, but He did not inherit it from Adam.
He bore the penalty for sin, but He never became a sinner.
His pure and perfect nature was untouched by sin.
He was treated as though He were guilty of all the sins ever committed by the human race, even though He committed none.
In exchange, God imputed the righteousness of Christ to believers and credited our accounts with His righteousness, just as He had credited our sins to Christ’s account (2 Corinthians 5:21).
A third type of sin is personal sin, that which is committed every day by every human being.
Because we have inherited a sin nature from Adam, we commit individual, personal sins, everything from seemingly innocent untruths to murder.
Those who have not placed their faith in Jesus Christ must pay the penalty for these personal sins, as well as inherited and imputed sin.
However, believers have been freed from the eternal penalty of sin—hell and spiritual death—but now we also have the power to resist sinning.
Now we can choose whether or not to commit personal sins because we have the power to resist sin through the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, sanctifying and convicting us of our sins when we do commit them (Romans 8:9-11).
Once we confess our personal sins to God and ask forgiveness for them, we are restored to perfect fellowship and communion with Him.
“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).
We are all three times condemned due to inherited sin, imputed sin, and personal sin.
The only just penalty for this sin is death (Romans 6:23), not just physical death but eternal death (Revelation 20:11-15).
Thankfully, inherited sin, imputed sin, and personal sin have all been crucified on the cross of Jesus, and now by faith in Jesus Christ as the Savior “we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7).

 The soul and the spirit are the two primary immaterial parts that Scripture ascribes to humanity.
It can be confusing to attempt to discern the precise differences between the two.
The word spirit refers only to the immaterial facet of humanity.
Human beings have a spirit, but we are not spirits.
However, in Scripture, only believers are said to be spiritually alive (1 Corinthians 2:11; Hebrews 4:12; James 2:26), while unbelievers are spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1–5; Colossians 2:13).
In Paul’s writing, the spiritual is pivotal to the life of the believer (1 Corinthians 2:14; 3:1; Ephesians 1:3; 5:19; Colossians 1:9; 3:16).
The spirit is the element in humanity that gives us the ability to have an intimate relationship with God.
Whenever the word spirit is used, it refers to the immaterial part of humanity that “connects” with God, who Himself is spirit (John 4:24).
However, in Scripture, only believers are said to be spiritually alive (1 Corinthians 2:11; Hebrews 4:12; James 2:26), while unbelievers are spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1–5; Colossians 2:13).
The word soul can refer to both the immaterial and material aspects of humanity.
Unlike human beings having a spirit, human beings are souls.
In its most basic sense, the word soul means “life”; however, beyond this essential meaning, the Bible speaks of the soul in many contexts.

One of these is in relation to humanity’s eagerness to sin (Luke 12:26).
Human beings have a sinful nature, and our souls are tainted with sin.
The soul, as the life essence of the body, is removed at the time of physical death (Genesis 35:18; Jeremiah 15:2).
The soul and the spirit are connected, but separable (Hebrews 4:12).
The soul, as with the spirit, is the center of many spiritual and emotional experiences (Job 30:25; Psalm 43:5; Jeremiah 13:17).
The word soul can refer to the whole person, whether alive on earth or in the afterlife.
The soul and the spirit are connected, but separable (Hebrews 4:12).

The spirit is the immaterial part of humanity that connects with God.

 The first occurrence of speaking in tongues occurred on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2:1-4.
The apostles went out and shared the gospel with the crowds, speaking to them in their own languages: “We hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!” (Acts 2:11).
The apostles went out and shared the gospel with the crowds, speaking to them in their own languages: “We hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!” (Acts 2:11).
The Greek word translated tongues literally means “languages.” Therefore, the gift of tongues is speaking in a language a person does not know in order to minister to someone who does speak that language.
The Greek word translated tongues literally means “languages.” Therefore, the gift of tongues is speaking in a language a person does not know in order to minister to someone who does speak that language.
In 1 Corinthians chapters 12–14, Paul discusses miraculous gifts, saying, “Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?” (1 Corinthians 14:6).
A person with the gift of interpreting tongues (1 Corinthians 12:30) could understand what a tongues-speaker was saying even though he did not know the language that was being spoken.
The tongues interpreter would then communicate the message of the tongues speaker to everyone else, so all could understand.
The tongues interpreter would then communicate the message of the tongues speaker to everyone else, so all could understand.
Paul’s conclusion regarding tongues that were not interpreted is powerful: “But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue” (1 Corinthians 14:19).
Paul’s conclusion regarding tongues that were not interpreted is powerful: “But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue” (1 Corinthians 14:19).
Some point to a difference in the tense of the Greek verbs referring to prophecy and knowledge “ceasing” and that of tongues “being ceased” as evidence for tongues ceasing before the arrival of the “perfect.” While possible, this is not explicitly clear from the text.
First Corinthians 13:8 mentions the gift of tongues ceasing, although it connects the ceasing with the arrival of the “perfect” in 1 Corinthians 13:10.
Therefore, when God did in fact judge Israel (with the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70), the gift of tongues would no longer serve its intended purpose.
Some also point to passages such as Isaiah 28:11 and Joel 2:28-29 as evidence that speaking in tongues was a sign of God’s oncoming judgment.
First Corinthians 14:22 describes tongues as a “sign to unbelievers.” According to this argument, the gift of tongues was a warning to the Jews that God was going to judge Israel for rejecting Jesus Christ as Messiah.
Therefore, when God did in fact judge Israel (with the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70), the gift of tongues would no longer serve its intended purpose.
It would be a real and intelligible language (1 Corinthians 14:10).
Scripture does not conclusively assert that the gift of speaking in tongues has ceased.
At the same time, if the gift of speaking in tongues were active in the church today, it would be performed in agreement with Scripture.
It would be for the purpose of communicating God’s Word with a person of another language (Acts 2:6-12).
It would also be in accordance with 1 Corinthians 14:33, “For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.”
 God can most definitely give a person the gift of speaking in tongues to enable him or her to communicate with a person who speaks another language.
It would also be in accordance with 1 Corinthians 14:33, “For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.”
 God can most definitely give a person the gift of speaking in tongues to enable him or her to communicate with a person who speaks another language.
 God can most definitely give a person the gift of speaking in tongues to enable him or her to communicate with a person who speaks another language.
The Holy Spirit is sovereign in the dispersion of the spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12:11).
Just imagine how much more productive missionaries could be if they did not have to go to language school, and were instantly able to speak to people in their own language.
These facts lead to the conclusion that the gift of tongues has ceased or is at least a rarity in God’s plan for the church today.

 The great white throne judgment is described in Revelation 20:11-15 and is the final judgment prior to the lost being cast into the lake of fire.
We know from Revelation 20:7-15 that this judgment will take place after the millennium and after Satan is thrown into the lake of fire where the beast and the false prophet are (Revelation 19:19-20; 20:7-10).
The books that are opened (Revelation 20:12) contain records of everyone’s deeds, whether they are good or evil, because God knows everything that has ever been said, done, or even thought, and He will reward or punish each one accordingly (Psalm 28:4; 62:12; Romans 2:6; Revelation 2:23; 18:6; 22:12).
Also at this time, another book is opened, called the “book of life” (Revelation 20:12).
It is this book that determines whether a person will inherit eternal life with God or receive everlasting punishment in the lake of fire.
Although Christians are held accountable for their actions, they are forgiven in Christ and their names were written in the “book of life from the creation of the world” (Revelation 17:8).
We also know from Scripture that it is at this judgment when the dead will be “judged according to what they had done” (Revelation 20:12) and that “anyone’s name” that is not “found written in the book of life” will be “thrown into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:15).
The fact that there is going to be a final judgment for all men, both believers and unbelievers, is clearly confirmed in many passages of Scripture.
Every person will one day stand before Christ and be judged for his or her deeds.
While it is very clear that the great white throne judgment is the final judgment, Christians disagree on how it relates to the other judgments mentioned in the Bible, specifically, who will be judged at the great white throne judgment.
Some Christians believe that the Scriptures reveal three different judgments to come.
The first is the judgment of the sheep and the goats or a judgment of the nations (Matthew 25:31-36).
This takes place after the tribulation period but prior to the millennium; its purpose is to determine who will enter the millennial kingdom.
The second is a judgment of believers’ works, often referred to as the “judgment seat [bema] of Christ” (2 Corinthians 5:10).
At this judgment, Christians will receive degrees of reward for their works or service to God.
The third is the great white throne judgment at the end of the millennium (Revelation 20:11-15).
This is the judgment of unbelievers in which they are judged according to their works and sentenced to everlasting punishment in the lake of fire.
Other Christians believe that all three of these judgments speak of the same final judgment, not of three separate judgments.
In other words, the great white throne judgment in Revelation 20:11-15 will be the time that believers and unbelievers alike are judged.
Those whose names are found in the book of life will be judged for their deeds in order to determine the rewards they will receive or lose.
Those whose names are not in the book of life will be judged according to their deeds to determine the degree of punishment they will receive in the lake of fire.
Those who hold this view believe that Matthew 25:31-46 is another description of what takes place at the great white throne judgment.
They point to the fact that the result of this judgment is the same as what is seen after the great white throne judgment in Revelation 20:11-15.
The sheep (believers) enter into eternal life, while the goats (unbelievers) are cast into “eternal punishment” (Matthew 25:46).
Whichever view one holds of the great white throne judgment, it is important to never lose sight of the facts concerning the coming judgment(s).
First, Jesus Christ will be the judge, all unbelievers will be judged by Christ, and they will be punished according to the works they have done.
The Bible is very clear that unbelievers are storing up wrath against themselves (Romans 2:5) and that God will “give to each person according to what he has done” (Romans 2:6).
Believers will also be judged by Christ, but since Christ’s righteousness has been imputed to us and our names are written in the book of life, we will be rewarded, but not punished, according to our deeds.
Romans 14:10-12 says that we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ and that each one of us will give an account to God.

 Questions about Heaven, Hell, and Eternity
                                                                                         Answer
 The hypostatic union is the term used to describe how God the Son, Jesus Christ, took on a human nature, yet remained fully God at the same time.
Jesus always had been God (John 8:58, 10:30), but at the incarnation Jesus became a human being (John 1:14).
The addition of the human nature to the divine nature is Jesus, the God-man.
This is the hypostatic union, Jesus Christ, one Person, fully God and fully man.
Jesus’ two natures, human and divine, are inseparable.
Jesus will forever be the God-man, fully God and fully human, two distinct natures in one Person.
Jesus’ humanity and divinity are not mixed, but are united without loss of separate identity.
Jesus sometimes operated with the limitations of humanity (John 4:6, 19:28) and other times in the power of His deity (John 11:43; Matthew 14:18-21).
In both, Jesus’ actions were from His one Person.
Jesus had two natures, but only one personality.
The doctrine of the hypostatic union is an attempt to explain how Jesus could be both God and man at the same time.
It is ultimately, though, a doctrine we are incapable of fully understanding.
It is impossible for us to fully understand how God works.
We, as human beings with finite minds, should not expect to totally comprehend an infinite God.
Jesus is God’s Son in that He was conceived by the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35).
But that does not mean Jesus did not exist before He was conceived.
Jesus has always existed (John 8:58, 10:30).
When Jesus was conceived, He became a human being in addition to being God (John 1:1, 14).
Jesus is both God and man.
Jesus has always been God, but He did not become a human being until He was conceived in Mary.
Jesus became a human being in order to identify with us in our struggles (Hebrews 2:17) and, more importantly, so that He could die on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins (Philippians 2:5-11).
In summary, the hypostatic union teaches that Jesus is both fully human and fully divine, that there is no mixture or dilution of either nature, and that He is one united Person, forever.

 Very simply, baptism is an outward testimony of the inward change in a believer’s life.
 Christian baptism illustrates, in dramatic style, the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ.
Romans 6:4 puts it this way: “We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”
Romans 6:4 puts it this way: “We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”
Romans 6:4 puts it this way: “We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”
Baptism illustrates a believer’s identification with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection.
Being submerged in the water represents death to sin, and emerging from the water represents the cleansed, holy life that follows salvation.
The Bible shows in many places that the order of events is 1) a person believes in the Lord Jesus and 2) he is baptized.
It is through this ordinance that a person is admitted into the fellowship of the church.
Everywhere the gospel is preached and people are drawn to faith in Christ, they are to be baptized.
Baptism illustrates a believer’s identification with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection.

 A study of the Lord’s Supper is a soul-stirring experience because of the depth of meaning it contains.
It was during the age-old celebration of the Passover on the eve of His death that Jesus instituted a significant new fellowship meal that we observe to this day.
It is an integral part of Christian worship.
It causes us to remember our Lord’s death and resurrection and to look for His glorious return in the future.
The Passover was the most sacred feast of the Jewish religious year.
It commemorated the final plague on Egypt when the firstborn of the Egyptians died and the Israelites were spared because of the blood of a lamb that was sprinkled on their doorposts.
The lamb was then roasted and eaten with unleavened bread.
God’s command was that throughout the generations to come the feast would be celebrated.
The story is recorded in Exodus 12.
During the Last Supper—a Passover celebration—Jesus took a loaf of bread and gave thanks to God.
As He broke it and gave it to His disciples, He said, “‘This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you’” (Luke 22:19-21).
He concluded the feast by singing a hymn (Matthew 26:30), and they went out into the night to the Mount of Olives.
It was there that, as predicted, Jesus was betrayed by Judas.
It was during the age-old celebration of the Passover on the eve of His death that Jesus instituted a significant new fellowship meal that we observe to this day.
The apostle Paul wrote concerning the Lord’s Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23-29.
Paul includes a statement not found in the Gospels: “Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself” (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).
Or it may mean to allow the ceremony to become a dead and formal ritual or to come to the Lord’s Supper with unconfessed sin.
In keeping with Paul’s instruction, we should examine ourselves before eating the bread and drinking the cup.
Another statement Paul made that is not included in the gospel accounts is “For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes” (1 Corinthians 11:26).
Or it may mean to allow the ceremony to become a dead and formal ritual or to come to the Lord’s Supper with unconfessed sin.
From these brief accounts we learn how Jesus used two of the frailest of elements as symbols of His body and blood and established them as a monument to His death.
It was not a monument of carved marble or molded brass, but of bread and wine.
He declared that the bread spoke of His body which would be broken.
There was not a broken bone, but His body was so badly tortured that it was hardly recognizable (Psalm 22:12-17; Isaiah 53:4-7).
The wine spoke of His blood, indicating the terrible death He would soon experience.
He, the perfect Son of God, became the fulfillment of the countless Old Testament prophecies concerning a Redeemer (Genesis 3:15; Psalm 22; Isaiah 53).
It indicated also that the Passover, which required the death of a lamb and looked forward to the coming of the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world, was fulfilled in the Lord’s Supper.
The New Covenant replaced the Old Covenant when Christ, the Passover Lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7), was sacrificed (Hebrews 8:8-13).
The Lord’s Supper/Christian Communion is a remembrance of what Christ did for us and a celebration of what we receive as a result of His sacrifice.

 The Intelligent Design Theory says that intelligent causes are necessary to explain the complex, information-rich structures of biology and that these causes are empirically detectable.
One of the arguments for Intelligent Design, irreducible complexity, is defined as “a single system which is composed of several well-matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.” Simply put, life is comprised of intertwined parts that rely on each other in order to be useful.
For example, the human eye is obviously a very useful system.
Random mutation may account for the development of a new part, but it cannot account for the concurrent development of multiple parts necessary for a functioning system.
For example, the human eye is obviously a very useful system.
Without the eyeball, the optic nerve, and the visual cortex, a randomly mutated incomplete eye would actually be counterproductive to the survival of a species and would therefore be eliminated through the process of natural selection.
Another argument for Intelligent Design, specified complexity, is the concept that, since specified complex patterns can be found in organisms, some form of guidance must have accounted for their origin.
For example, a room filled with 100 monkeys and 100 computers may eventually produce a few words, or maybe even a sentence, but it would never produce a Shakespearean play.
And how much more complex is biological life than a Shakespearean play?
The anthropic principle of Intelligent Design states that the world and universe are “fine-tuned” to allow for life on Earth.
If the ratio of elements in the atmosphere of the earth was altered slightly, many species would quickly cease to exist.
If the earth were significantly closer to or further away from the sun, many species would cease to exist.
The existence and development of life on Earth requires so many variables to be perfectly in tune that it would be impossible for all the variables to come into being through random, uncoordinated events.
While the Intelligent Design Theory does not presume to identify the source of intelligence (whether it be God or UFOs or something else), the vast majority of Intelligent Design theorists are theists.
They see the appearance of design which pervades the biological world as evidence for the existence of God.
There are, however, a few atheists who cannot deny the strong evidence for design but are not willing to acknowledge a Creator God.
They see the appearance of design which pervades the biological world as evidence for the existence of God.
Of course, their interpretation does not address the origin of the aliens, either, so they are back to the original argument with no credible answer.
As such, Intelligent Design is compatible with biblical creationism, but it is not an inherently religious position.
Biblical creationists conclude that the Genesis account of creation is reliable and correct, and so life on Earth was designed by an intelligent agent: God.
They see the facets of Intelligent Design as evidence from the natural realm that supports this conclusion.
They tend to interpret the data as evidence that earth was seeded by some sort of master race of extraterrestrial creatures (aliens).

 Romans 14:10–12 says, “For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat.
 Romans 14:10–12 says, “For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat.
So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God” (ESV).
Second Corinthians 5:10 tells us, “We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.” In context, it is clear that both passages refer to Christians, not unbelievers.

The judgment seat of Christ does not determine salvation; that was determined by Christ’s sacrifice on our behalf (1 John 2:2) and our faith in Him (John 3:16).
Second Corinthians 5:10 tells us, “We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.” In context, it is clear that both passages refer to Christians, not unbelievers.
The judgment seat of Christ, therefore, involves believers giving an account of their lives to Christ.
Yes, as the Bible says, we will have to give an account of ourselves.
We should not look at the judgment seat of Christ as God judging our sins, but rather as God rewarding us for our lives.
We should not look at the judgment seat of Christ as God judging our sins, but rather as God rewarding us for our lives.
At the judgment seat of Christ, believers are rewarded based on how faithfully they served Christ (1 Corinthians 9:4-27; 2 Timothy 2:5).
Some of the things we might be judged on are how well we obeyed the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20), how victorious we were over sin (Romans 6:1-4), and how well we controlled our tongues (James 3:1-9).

 The Lord’s Prayer is a prayer the Lord Jesus taught His disciples in Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4.
 The Lord’s Prayer is a prayer the Lord Jesus taught His disciples in Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4.
Matthew 6:9-13 says, “This, then, is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
'“ Many people misunderstand the Lord’s Prayer to be a prayer we are supposed to recite word for word.
Some people treat the Lord’s Prayer as a magic formula, as if the words themselves have some specific power or influence with God.
The Bible teaches the opposite.
'“ Many people misunderstand the Lord’s Prayer to be a prayer we are supposed to recite word for word.
Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
In prayer, we are to pour out our hearts to God (Philippians 4:6-7), not simply recite memorized words to God.
The Lord’s Prayer should be understood as an example, a pattern, of how to pray.
It gives us the “ingredients” that should go into prayer.
Here is how it breaks down.
“Our Father in heaven” is teaching us whom to address our prayers to—the Father.
So, again, the Lord’s Prayer is not a prayer we are to memorize and recite back to God.
The phrase “your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” is a reminder to us that we are to pray for God’s plan in our lives and the world, not our own plan.
It gives us the “ingredients” that should go into prayer.
“Hallowed be your name” is telling us to worship God, and to praise Him for who He is.
The conclusion of the Lord’s Prayer, “And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one” is a plea for help in achieving victory over sin and a request for protection from the attacks of the devil.
'“ Many people misunderstand the Lord’s Prayer to be a prayer we are supposed to recite word for word.
Is there anything wrong with memorizing the Lord’s Prayer?
Is there anything wrong with memorizing the Lord’s Prayer?
Not if your heart is in it and you truly mean the words you say.
In prayer, we are to pour out our hearts to God (Philippians 4:6-7), not simply recite memorized words to God.
Philippians 4:6-7 declares, “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”

 What is the meaning of life?
How can purpose, fulfillment, and satisfaction in life be found?
How can something of lasting significance be achieved?
Many people have never stopped to consider these important questions.
They look back years later and wonder why their relationships have fallen apart and why they feel so empty, even though they may have achieved what they set out to accomplish.
An athlete who had reached the pinnacle of his sport was once asked what he wished someone would have told him when he first started playing his sport.
He replied, “I wish that someone would have told me that when you reach the top, there’s nothing there.” Many goals reveal their emptiness only after years have been wasted in their pursuit.
In our humanistic culture, people lose sight of the meaning of life.
They pursue many things, thinking that in them they will find meaning and purpose.
Some of these pursuits include business success, wealth, good relationships, sex, entertainment, and doing good to others.
People have testified that, while they achieved their goals of wealth, relationships, and pleasure, there was still a deep void inside, a feeling of emptiness that nothing seemed to fill.
The author of the book of Ecclesiastes looked for the meaning of life in many vain pursuits.
He describes the feeling of emptiness he felt: “Meaningless!
Meaningless!
.
.
.
Utterly meaningless!
Everything is meaningless” (Ecclesiastes 1:2).
King Solomon, the writer of Ecclesiastes, had wealth beyond measure, wisdom beyond any man of his time or ours, hundreds of women, palaces and gardens that were the envy of kingdoms, the best food and wine, and every form of entertainment available.
He said at one point that anything his heart wanted, he pursued (Ecclesiastes 2:10).
And yet he summed up life “under the sun”—life lived as though all there is to life is what we can see with our eyes and experience with our senses—is meaningless.
What explains this void?
God created us for something beyond what we can experience in the here-and-now.
Solomon said of God, “He has also set eternity in the hearts of men” (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
In our hearts we are aware that the “here-and-now” is not all that there is.
In the book of Genesis, we find a clue to the meaning of life in the fact that God created mankind in His image (Genesis 1:26).
This means that we are more like God than we are like anything else.
We also find that, before mankind fell and the curse of sin came upon the earth, the following things were true: 1) God made man a social creature (Genesis 2:18–25); 2) God gave man work (Genesis 2:15); 3) God had fellowship with man (Genesis 3:8); and 4) God gave man dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26).
These facts have significance related to the meaning of life.
God intended mankind to have fulfillment in life, but our condition (especially touching our fellowship with God) was adversely affected by the fall into sin and the resulting curse upon the earth (Genesis 3).
The book of Revelation shows that God is concerned with restoring the meaning of life to us.
God reveals that He will destroy this present creation and create a new heaven and a new earth.
At that time, He will restore full fellowship with redeemed mankind, while the unredeemed will have been judged unworthy and cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11–15).
The curse of sin will be done away with; there will be no more sin, sorrow, sickness, death, or pain (Revelation 21:4).
God will dwell with mankind, and they shall be His children (Revelation 21:7).
Thus, we come full circle: God created us to have fellowship with Him; man sinned, breaking that fellowship; God restores that fellowship fully in the eternal state.
To go through life achieving everything we set out to achieve only to die separated from God for eternity would be worse than futile!
But God has made a way to not only make eternal bliss possible (Luke 23:43) but also life on earth satisfying and meaningful.
How is this eternal bliss and “heaven on earth” obtained?
The meaning of life restored through Jesus Christ
 The real meaning of life, both now and in eternity, is found in the restoration of our relationship with God.
This restoration is only possible through God’s Son, Jesus Christ, who reconciles us to God (Romans 5:10; Acts 4:12; John 1:12; 14:6).
Salvation and eternal life are gained when we trust in Jesus Christ as Savior.
Once that salvation is received by grace through faith, Christ makes us new creations, and we begin the progressive journey of growing closer to Him and learning to rely on Him.
God wants us to know the meaning of life.
Jesus said, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
A “full” life is logically one that is meaningful and devoid of aimless wandering.
The meaning of life is wrapped up in the glory of God.
In calling His elect, God says, “Bring all who claim me as their God, for I have made them for my glory.
It was I who created them” (Isaiah 43:7, NLT).
The reason we were made is for God’s glory.
Any time we substitute our own glory for God’s, we miss the meaning of life.
“If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it” (Matthew 16:24–25).
“Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4).

 The millennial kingdom is the title given to the 1,000-year reign of Jesus Christ on the earth.
Some seek to interpret the 1,000 years in an allegorical manner.
They understand the 1,000 years as merely a figurative way of saying “a long period of time,” not a literal, physical reign of Jesus Christ on the earth.
Some seek to interpret the 1,000 years in an allegorical manner.
If God wished to communicate “a long period of time,” He could have easily done so without explicitly and repeatedly mentioning an exact time frame.
The Bible tells us that when Christ returns to the earth He will establish Himself as king in Jerusalem, sitting on the throne of David (Luke 1:32–33).
The unconditional covenants demand a literal, physical return of Christ to establish the kingdom.
The Abrahamic Covenant promised Israel a land, a posterity and ruler, and a spiritual blessing (Genesis 12:1–3).
The Abrahamic Covenant promised Israel a land, a posterity and ruler, and a spiritual blessing (Genesis 12:1–3).
The Palestinian Covenant promised Israel a restoration to the land and occupation of the land (Deuteronomy 30:1–10).
The Davidic Covenant promised Israel a king from David’s line who would rule forever—giving the nation rest from all their enemies (2 Samuel 7:10–13).
The Bible speaks of the conditions during the millennium as a perfect environment physically and spiritually.
At the second coming, these covenants will be fulfilled as Israel is re-gathered from the nations (Matthew 24:31), converted (Zechariah 12:10–14), and restored to the land under the rule of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
The Bible speaks of the conditions during the millennium as a perfect environment physically and spiritually.
It will be a time of peace (Micah 4:2–4; Isaiah 32:17–18), joy (Isaiah 61:7, 10), and comfort (Isaiah 40:1–2).
The Bible also tells us that only believers will enter the millennial kingdom.
Because of this, it will be a time of obedience (Jeremiah 31:33), holiness (Isaiah 35:8), truth (Isaiah 65:16), and the knowledge of God (Isaiah 11:9, Habakkuk 2:14).
Christ will rule as king (Isaiah 9:3–7; 11:1–10).
Nobles and governors will also rule (Isaiah 32:1; Matthew 19:28), and Jerusalem will be the political center of the world (Zechariah 8:3).
The fulfillment of many of God’s covenants and promises rests on a literal, physical, future kingdom.
There are countless other passages that point to a literal reign of the Messiah on the earth.

 The Bible does not explicitly give us the origin of the different “races” or skin colors in humanity.
In actuality, there is only one race—the human race.
Within the human race is diversity in skin color and other physical characteristics.
Some speculate that when God confused the languages at the tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9), He also created racial diversity.
The races/skin colors of humanity are nowhere mentioned in connection with the tower of Babel.
It is possible that God made genetic changes to humanity to better enable people to survive in different ecologies, such as the darker skin of Africans being better equipped genetically to survive the excessive heat in Africa.
According to this view, God confused the languages, causing humanity to segregate linguistically, and then created genetic racial differences based on where each racial group would eventually settle.
The races/skin colors of humanity are nowhere mentioned in connection with the tower of Babel.
While possible, there is no explicit biblical basis for this view.
The races/skin colors of humanity are nowhere mentioned in connection with the tower of Babel.
At the Tower of Babel, when the different languages came into existence, groups that spoke one language moved away with others of the same language.
In doing so, the gene pool for a specific group shrank dramatically as the group no longer had the entire human population to mix with.
At the Tower of Babel, when the different languages came into existence, groups that spoke one language moved away with others of the same language.
Closer inbreeding took place, and in time certain features were emphasized in these different groups (all of which were present as a possibility in the genetic code).
As further inbreeding occurred through the generations, the gene pool grew smaller and smaller, to the point that people of one language family all had the same or similar features.
Another explanation is that Adam and Eve possessed the genes to produce black, brown, and white offspring (and everything else in between).
This would be similar to how a mixed-race couple sometimes has children that vary in color.
Since God obviously desired humanity to be diverse in appearance, it makes sense that God would have given Adam and Eve the ability to produce children of different skin tones.
Later, the only survivors of the flood were Noah and his wife, Noah’s three sons and their wives—eight people in all (Genesis 7:13).
Perhaps Noah’s daughters-in-law were of different races.
Maybe all eight of them were of mixed race, which would mean they possessed the genetics to produce children of different races.
Whatever the explanation, the most important aspect of this question is that we are all the same race, all created by the same God, all created for the same purpose—to glorify Him.

 Many people ask, “Is there a prayer I can pray that will guarantee my salvation?” It is important to remember that salvation is not received by reciting a prayer or uttering certain words.
The Bible nowhere records a person’s receiving salvation by a prayer.
Saying a prayer is not the biblical way of salvation.
The biblical method of salvation is faith in Jesus Christ.
John 3:16 tells us, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Salvation is gained by faith (Ephesians 2:8), by receiving Jesus as Savior (John 1:12), and by fully trusting Jesus alone (John 14:6; Acts 4:12), not by reciting a prayer.
The biblical message of salvation is simple, clear, and amazing at the same time.
We have all committed sin against God (Romans 3:23).
Other than Jesus Christ, there is no one who has lived an entire life without sinning (Ecclesiastes 7:20).
Because of our sin, we have earned judgment from God—death (Romans 6:23).
Because of our sin and its deserved punishment, there is nothing we can do on our own to make ourselves right with God.
As a result of His love for us, God became a human being in the Person of Jesus Christ.
Jesus lived a perfect life and always taught the truth.
However, humanity rejected Jesus and put Him to death by crucifying Him.
Though that horrible act killed the only truly innocent man, our salvation was obtained.
Jesus died in our place.
He took the burden and judgment of our sin upon Himself (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus was then resurrected (1 Corinthians 15), proving that His payment for sin was sufficient and that He had overcome sin and death.
As a result of Jesus’ sacrifice, God offers us salvation as a gift.
God calls us all to repent of our sins (Acts 17:30) and have faith in Christ as the full payment of our sins (1 John 2:2).
Salvation is gained by receiving the gift God offers us, not by praying a certain prayer.
Now, that does not mean prayer cannot be involved in receiving salvation.
If you understand the gospel, believe it to be true, and have accepted Jesus as your salvation, it is good and appropriate to express that faith to God in prayer.
Communicating with God through prayer can be a way to progress from accepting facts about Jesus to fully trusting in Him as Savior.
Prayer can be connected to the act of placing your faith in Jesus alone for salvation.

 Questions about Salvation
                                                                                         Answer
 According to preterism, all prophecy in the Bible is really history.
The preterist interpretation of Scripture regards the book of Revelation as a symbolic picture of first-century conflicts, not a description of what will occur in the end times.
The term preterism comes from the Latin praeter, meaning “past.” Thus, preterism is the view that the biblical prophecies concerning the “end times” have already been fulfilled—in the past.
Preterism is directly opposed to futurism, which sees the end-times prophecies as having a still-future fulfillment.
Preterism is divided into two types: full (or consistent) preterism and partial preterism.
This article will confine the discussion to full preterism (or hyper-preterism, as some call it).
Preterism denies the future prophetic quality of the book of Revelation.
The preterist movement essentially teaches that all the end-times prophecies of the New Testament were fulfilled in AD 70 when the Romans attacked and destroyed Jerusalem.
Preterism teaches that every event normally associated with the end times—Christ’s second coming, the tribulation, the resurrection of the dead, the final judgment—has already happened.
(In the case of the final judgment, it still is in the process of being fulfilled.)
Jesus’ return to earth was a “spiritual” return, not a physical one.
Preterism teaches that the Law was fulfilled in AD 70 and God’s covenant with Israel was ended.
The “new heavens and new earth” spoken of in Revelation 21:1 is, to the preterist, a description of the world under the New Covenant.
Just as a Christian is made a “new creation” (2 Corinthians 5:17), so the world under the New Covenant is a “new earth.” This aspect of preterism can easily lead to a belief in replacement theology.
Preterists usually point to a passage in Jesus’ Olivet Discourse to bolster their argument.
After Jesus describes some of the end-times happenings, He says, “Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened” (Matthew 24:34).
The preterist takes this to mean that everything Jesus speaks of in Matthew 24 had to have occurred within one generation of His speaking—the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 was therefore “Judgment Day.”
 The problems with preterism are many.
For one thing, God’s covenant with Israel is everlasting (Jeremiah 31:33–36), and there will be a future restoration of Israel (Isaiah 11:12).
The apostle Paul warned against those who, like Hymenaeus and Philetus, teach falsely “that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some” (2 Timothy 2:17–18).
And Jesus’ mention of “this generation” should be taken to mean the generation that is alive to see the beginning of the events described in Matthew 24.
Eschatology is a complex subject, and the Bible’s use of apocalyptic imagery to relate many prophecies has led to a variety of interpretations of end-time events.
There is room for some disagreement within Christianity regarding these things.
However, full preterism has some serious flaws in that it denies the physical reality of Christ’s second coming and downplays the dreadful nature of the tribulation by restricting that event to the fall of Jerusalem.

 Questions about False Doctrine
                                                                                         Answer
 Acts 2:42 could be considered a purpose statement for the church: “They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.” According to this verse, the purposes/activities of the church should be 1) teaching biblical doctrine, 2) providing a place of fellowship for believers, 3) observing the Lord’s supper, and 4) praying.
The church is to teach biblical doctrine so we can be grounded in our faith.
Ephesians 4:14 tells us, “Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.” The church is to be a place of fellowship, where Christians can be devoted to one another and honor one another (Romans 12:10), instruct one another (Romans 15:14), be kind and compassionate to one another (Ephesians 4:32), encourage one another (1 Thessalonians 5:11), and most importantly, love one another (1 John 3:11).
The church is to be a place where believers can observe the Lord’s Supper, remembering Christ’s death and shed blood on our behalf (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).
The concept of “breaking bread” (Acts 2:42) also carries the idea of having meals together.
This is another example of the church promoting fellowship.
The final purpose of the church according to Acts 2:42 is prayer.
The church is to be a place that promotes prayer, teaches prayer, and practices prayer.
Philippians 4:6-7 encourages us, “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”
 Another commission given to the church is proclaiming the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8).
The church is called to be faithful in sharing the gospel through word and deed.
The church is to be a “lighthouse” in the community, pointing people toward our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
The church is to both promote the gospel and prepare its members to proclaim the gospel (1 Peter 3:15).
Some final purposes of the church are given in James 1:27: “Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.” The church is to be about the business of ministering to those in need.
This includes not only sharing the gospel, but also providing for physical needs (food, clothing, shelter) as necessary and appropriate.
The church is also to equip believers in Christ with the tools they need to overcome sin and remain free from the pollution of the world.
This is done by biblical teaching and Christian fellowship.
So, what is the purpose of the church?
Paul gave an excellent illustration to the believers in Corinth.
The church is God’s hands, mouth, and feet in this world—the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-27).
We are to be doing the things that Jesus Christ would do if He were here physically on the earth.
The church is to be “Christian,” “Christ-like,” and Christ-following.

 The word rapture does not occur in the Bible.
 The word rapture does not occur in the Bible.
The rapture is described primarily in 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18 and 1 Corinthians 15:50–54.
The rapture of the church is the event in which God “snatches away” all believers from the earth in order to make way for His righteous judgment to be poured out on the earth during the tribulation period.
At the rapture, the Lord comes “in the clouds” to meet us “in the air” (1 Thessalonians 4:17).
The rapture will involve an instantaneous transformation of our bodies to fit us for eternity.
For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:51–52).
We will finally be free from sin.
We will be in God’s presence forever.
There is far too much debate over the meaning and scope of the rapture.
This is not God’s intent.
Rather, the rapture should be a comforting doctrine full of hope; God wants us to “encourage each other with these words” (1 Thessalonians 4:18).
                                                                                         Answer

 Fast food restaurants entice us by allowing us to order our food exactly the way we want it.
Some coffee shops boast over a hundred different flavors and varieties of coffee.
Even when buying houses and cars, we can look for one with all the options and features we desire.
We no longer live in just a chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry world.
Choice is king!
You can find about anything you want according to your own personal likes and needs.
So how about a religion that is just right for you?
How about a religion that is guilt-free, makes no demands, and is not encumbered with a lot of bothersome do’s and don’ts?
It is out there, just as I have described.
But is religion something to be chosen like a favorite flavor of ice cream?
There are a lot of voices vying for our attention, so why should anyone consider Jesus above, say, Muhammad or Confucius, Buddha, or Charles Taze Russell, or Joseph Smith?
The truth is that all religions do not lead to Heaven, just as all roads do not lead to Indiana.
Jesus alone speaks with the authority of God because Jesus alone conquered death.
Muhammad, Confucius, and the others molder in their graves to this very day.
But Jesus, by His own power, walked away from the tomb three days after dying on a cruel Roman cross.
Anyone with power over death deserves our attention.
Anyone with power over death deserves to be heard.
The evidence supporting the resurrection of Jesus is overwhelming.
First, there were over five hundred eye witnesses of the risen Christ!
Five hundred voices cannot be ignored.
There is also the matter of the empty tomb.
The enemies of Jesus could have easily stopped all talk of the resurrection by producing His dead, decaying body, but there was no dead body for them to produce!
The tomb was empty!
Could the disciples have stolen His body?
Hardly.
To prevent such a contingency, the tomb of Jesus had been heavily guarded by armed soldiers.
Considering His closest followers had fled in fear at His arrest and crucifixion, it is most unlikely this ragtag band of frightened fishermen would have gone head to head against trained, professional soldiers.
The enemies of Jesus could have easily stopped all talk of the resurrection by producing His dead, decaying body, but there was no dead body for them to produce!
The simple fact is that the resurrection of Jesus cannot be explained away!
Again, anyone who has power over death deserves to be heard.
Jesus proved His power over death; therefore, we need to hear what He says.
Jesus claims to be the only way to salvation (John 14:6).
Hardly.
Jesus is the way.
And this same Jesus says, "Come to me all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).
This is a tough world and life is difficult.
Most of us are pretty well bloodied, bruised, and battle-scarred.
Agree?
So what do you want?
Restoration or mere religion?
A living Savior or one of many dead "prophets"?
A meaningful relationship or empty rituals?
Jesus is the way.
Jesus is the right "religion" if you are looking for forgiveness (Acts 10:43).
Jesus is the right "religion" if you are looking for a meaningful relationship with God (John 10:10).
Jesus is the right "religion" if you are looking for an eternal home in Heaven (John 3:16).
Place your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior; you will not regret it!
Trust in Him for the forgiveness of your sins; you will not be disappointed.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.

 The Romans Road to salvation is a way of explaining the good news of salvation using verses from the Book of Romans.
It is a simple yet powerful method of explaining why we need salvation, how God provided salvation, how we can receive salvation, and what are the results of salvation.
The first verse on the Romans Road to salvation is Romans 3:23, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
The first verse on the Romans Road to salvation is Romans 3:23, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
We have all sinned.
We have all done things that are displeasing to God.
There is no one who is innocent.
Romans 3:10-18 gives a detailed picture of what sin looks like in our lives.
The second Scripture on the Romans Road to salvation, Romans 6:23, teaches us about the consequences of sin - "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
The punishment that we have earned for our sins is death.
Not just physical death, but eternal death!
The third verse on the Romans Road to salvation picks up where Romans 6:23 left off, "but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Jesus’ resurrection proves that God accepted Jesus’ death as the payment for our sins.
Romans 5:8 declares, "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
Jesus Christ died for us!
Jesus’ death paid for the price of our sins.
Jesus’ resurrection proves that God accepted Jesus’ death as the payment for our sins.
The fourth stop on the Romans Road to salvation is Romans 10:9, "that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."
Because of Jesus’ death on our behalf, all we have to do is believe in Him, trusting His death as the payment for our sins - and we will be saved!
Romans 10:13 says it again, "for everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
Jesus died to pay the penalty for our sins and rescue us from eternal death.
Salvation, the forgiveness of sins, is available to anyone who will trust in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
The final aspect of the Romans Road to salvation is the results of salvation.
Romans 5:1 has this wonderful message, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
Through Jesus Christ we can have a relationship of peace with God.
Romans 8:1 teaches us, "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
Because of Jesus’ death on our behalf, we will never be condemned for our sins.
Finally, we have this precious promise of God from Romans 8:38-39, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Would you like to follow the Romans Road to salvation?
If so, here is a simple prayer you can pray to God.
Saying this prayer is a way to declare to God that you are relying on Jesus Christ for your salvation.
Only faith in Jesus Christ can provide salvation!
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
With your help, I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"

 The second coming of Jesus Christ is the hope of believers that God is in control of all things, and is faithful to the promises and prophecies in His Word.
Jesus fulfilled many of the prophecies of the Messiah during His birth, life, ministry, death, and resurrection.
However, there are some prophecies regarding the Messiah that Jesus has not yet fulfilled.
The second coming of Christ will be the return of Christ to fulfill these remaining prophecies.
In His first coming, Jesus was the suffering Servant.
In His second coming, Jesus will be the conquering King.
In His first coming, Jesus arrived in the most humble of circumstances.
In His second coming, Jesus will arrive with the armies of heaven at His side.
The Old Testament prophets did not make clearly this distinction between the two comings.
This can be seen in Isaiah 7:14, 9:6-7 and Zechariah 14:4.
This can be seen in Isaiah 7:14, 9:6-7 and Zechariah 14:4.
As a result of the prophecies seeming to speak of two individuals, many Jewish scholars believed there would be both a suffering Messiah and a conquering Messiah.
Jesus fulfilled the role of the suffering servant (Isaiah chapter 53) in His first coming.
With justice he judges and makes war.
Zechariah 12:10 and Revelation 1:7, describing the second coming, look back to Jesus being pierced.
Israel, and the whole world, will mourn for not having accepted the Messiah the first time He came.
After Jesus ascended into heaven, the angels declared to the apostles, “‘Men of Galilee,’ they said, ‘why do you stand here looking into the sky?
Zechariah 12:10 and Revelation 1:7, describing the second coming, look back to Jesus being pierced.
Zechariah 14:4 identifies the location of the second coming as the Mount of Olives.
They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.” Titus 2:13 describes the second coming as a “glorious appearing.”
 The second coming is spoken of in greatest detail in Revelation 19:11-16, “I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True.
He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
‘He will rule them with an iron scepter.’ He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
‘He will rule them with an iron scepter.’ He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”

 The sinner’s prayer is a prayer a person prays to God when they understand that they are a sinner and in need of a Savior.
Saying a sinner’s prayer will not accomplish anything on its own.
A true sinner’s prayer only represents what a person knows, understands, and believes about their sinfulness and need for salvation.
The first aspect of a sinner’s prayer is understanding that we are all sinners.
Romans 3:10 proclaims, "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one."
The Bible makes it clear that we have all sinned.
We are all sinners in need of mercy and forgiveness from God (Titus 3:5-7).
Because of our sin, we deserve eternal punishment (Matthew 25:46).
The sinner’s prayer is a plea for grace instead of judgment.
It is a request for mercy instead of wrath.
The second aspect of a sinner’s prayer is knowing what God has done to remedy our lost and sinful condition.
God took on flesh and became a human being in the Person of Jesus Christ (John 1:1,14).
Jesus taught us the truth about God and lived a perfectly righteous and sinless life (John 8:46; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus then died on the cross in our place, taking the punishment that we deserve (Romans 5:8).
Jesus rose from the dead to prove His victory over sin, death, and hell (Colossians 2:15; 1 Corinthians chapter 15).
Because of all of this, we can have our sins forgiven and be promised an eternal home in Heaven - if we will just place our faith in Jesus Christ.
All we have to do is believe that He died in our place and rose from the dead (Romans 10:9-10).
We can be saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone.
Ephesians 2:8 declares, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God."

 Questions about Salvation
                                                                                         Answer
 The substitutionary atonement refers to Jesus Christ dying as a substitute for sinners.
The Scriptures teach that all men are sinners (Romans 3:9-18, 23).
The penalty for our sinfulness is death.
Romans 6:23 reads, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
  That verse teaches us several things.
Without Christ, we are going to die and spend an eternity in hell as payment for our sins.
 The substitutionary atonement refers to Jesus Christ dying as a substitute for sinners.
Death in the Scriptures refers to a “separation.” Everyone will die, but some will live in heaven with the Lord for eternity, while others will live a life in hell for eternity.
However, the second thing this verse teaches us is that eternal life is available through Jesus Christ.
This is His substitutionary atonement.
Jesus Christ died in our place when He was crucified on the cross.
We deserved to be the ones placed on that cross to die because we are the ones who live sinful lives.
Here again we see that Christ took the sins we committed onto Himself to pay the price for us.
“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21).
“He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed” (1 Peter 2:24).
Here again we see that Christ took the sins we committed onto Himself to pay the price for us.
“He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed” (1 Peter 2:24).
Not only do these verses teach us about the substitute that Christ was for us, but they also teach that He was the atonement, meaning He satisfied the payment due for the sinfulness of man.
One more passage that talks about the substitutionary atonement is Isaiah 53:5.
This verse talks about the coming Christ who was to die on the cross for our sins.
The prophecy is very detailed, and the crucifixion happened just as it was foretold.
“He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed” (1 Peter 2:24).
Here again we see that Christ paid the price for us!
We can only pay the price of sin on our own by being punished and placed in hell for all eternity.
But God’s Son, Jesus Christ, came to earth to pay the price of our sins.
Because He did this for us, we now have the opportunity to not only have our sins forgiven, but to spend eternity with Him.
In order to do this, we must place our faith in what Christ did on the cross.
We cannot save ourselves; we need a substitute to take our place.
The death of Jesus Christ is the substitutionary atonement.

The church, made up of all who have trusted in the person and work of the Lord Jesus to save them from being punished for sin, will not be present during the tribulation.
The church will be removed from the earth in an event known as the rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-53).
The church is saved from the wrath to come (1 Thessalonians 5:9).
Throughout Scripture, the tribulation is referred to by other names such as the Day of the Lord (Isaiah 2:12; 13:6-9; Joel 1:15; 2:1-31; 3:14; 1 Thessalonians 5:2); trouble or tribulation (Deuteronomy 4:30; Zephaniah 1:1); the great tribulation, which refers to the more intense second half of the seven-year period (Matthew 24:21); time or day of trouble (Daniel 12:1; Zephaniah 1:15); time of Jacob’s trouble (Jeremiah 30:7).
An understanding of Daniel 9:24-27 is necessary in order to understand the purpose and time of the tribulation.
This passage speaks of 70 weeks that have been declared against “your people.” Daniel’s people are the Jews, the nation of Israel, and Daniel 9:24 speaks of a period of time that God has given “to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.” God declares that “seventy sevens” will fulfill all these things.

 The tribulation is a future seven-year period of time when God will finish His discipline of Israel and finalize His judgment of the unbelieving world.
This is 70 sevens of years, or 490 years.
(Some translations refer to 70 weeks of years.)
This is confirmed by another part of this passage in Daniel.
In verses 25 and 26, Daniel is told that the Messiah will be cut off after “seven sevens and sixty-two sevens” (69 total), beginning with the decree to rebuild Jerusalem.
In other words, 69 sevens of years (483 years) after the decree to rebuild Jerusalem, the Messiah will be cut off.
Biblical historians confirm that 483 years passed from the time of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the time when Jesus was crucified.
Most Christian scholars, regardless of their view of eschatology (future things/events), have the above understanding of Daniel’s 70 sevens.
With 483 years having passed from the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the cutting off of the Messiah, this leaves one seven-year period to be fulfilled in terms of Daniel 9:24: “to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.” This final seven-year period is known as the tribulation period—it is a time when God finishes judging Israel for its sin.

And on a wing of the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.” The person of whom this verse speaks is the person Jesus calls the “abomination that causes desolation” (Matthew 24:15) and is called “the beast” in Revelation 13.
Daniel 9:27 says that the beast will make a covenant for seven years, but in the middle of this week (3 1/2 years into the tribulation), he will break the covenant, putting a stop to sacrifice.
Revelation 13 explains that the beast will place an image of himself in the temple and require the world to worship him.
Revelation 13:5 says that this will go on for 42 months, which is 3 1/2 years.
Since Daniel 9:27 says that this will happen in the middle of the week, and Revelation 13:5 says that the beast will do this for a period of 42 months, it is easy to see that the total length of time is 84 months or seven years.
Also see Daniel 7:25, where the “time, times, and half a time” (time=1 year; times=2 years; half a time=1/2 year; total of 3 1/2 years) also refers to “great tribulation,” the last half of the seven-year tribulation period when the beast will be in power.
For further references about the tribulation, see Revelation 11:2-3, which speaks of 1260 days and 42 months, and Daniel 12:11-12, which speaks of 1290 days and 1335 days.
These days have a reference to the midpoint of the tribulation.
The additional days in Daniel 12 may include the time at the end for the judgment of the nations (Matthew 25:31-46) and time for the setting up of Christ’s millennial kingdom (Revelation 20:4-6).

The reason you feel hungry, the reason you seem to be lost in darkness, the reason you cannot find meaning in life, is that you are separated from God.
The Bible tells us that we have all sinned and are therefore separated from God (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23).
The void you feel in your heart is God missing from your life.

Jesus took your sin upon Himself (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus died in your place (Romans 5:8), taking the punishment that you deserve.
Three days later, Jesus rose from the dead, proving His victory over sin and death (Romans 6:4–5).
Why did He do it?
Jesus answered that question Himself: “Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13).
Jesus died so that you could live.
If you place your faith in Jesus, trusting His death as the payment for your sins, all of your sins are forgiven and washed away.
You will then have your spiritual hunger satisfied.
The lights will be turned on.
You will have access to a fulfilling life.
You will know your true best friend and good shepherd.
You will know that you have life after you die—a resurrected life in heaven for eternity with Jesus!
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).

 Matthew 24:5–8 gives us some important clues for discerning the approach of the end times: “Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many.
Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.
All these are the beginning of birth pains.” An increase in false messiahs, an increase in warfare, and increases in famines, plagues, and natural disasters—these are signs of the end times.
In this passage, though, we are given a warning: we are not to be deceived, because these events are only the beginning of birth pains; the end is still to come.
Some interpreters point to every earthquake, every political upheaval, and every attack on Israel as a sure sign that the end times are rapidly approaching.
While the events may signal the approach of the last days, they are not necessarily indicators that the end times have arrived.
The apostle Paul warned that the last days would bring a marked increase in false teaching.
“The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons” (1 Timothy 4:1).
The last days are described as “perilous times” because of the increasingly evil character of man and people who actively “oppose the truth” (2 Timothy 3:1–9; see also 2 Thessalonians 2:3).
Other possible signs would include a rebuilding of a Jewish temple in Jerusalem, increased hostility toward Israel, and advances toward a one-world government.
The most prominent sign of the end times, however, is the nation of Israel.
In 1948, Israel was recognized as a sovereign state, essentially for the first time since AD 70.
God promised Abraham that his posterity would have Canaan as “an everlasting possession” (Genesis 17:8), and Ezekiel prophesied a physical and spiritual resuscitation of Israel (Ezekiel 37).

God promised Abraham that his posterity would have Canaan as “an everlasting possession” (Genesis 17:8), and Ezekiel prophesied a physical and spiritual resuscitation of Israel (Ezekiel 37).
Having Israel as a nation in its own land is important in light of end-times prophecy because of Israel’s prominence in eschatology (Daniel 10:14; 11:41; Revelation 11:8).
With these signs in mind, we can be wise and discerning in regard to the expectation of the end times.
We should not, however, interpret any of these singular events as a clear indication of the soon arrival of the end times.
God has given us enough information that we can be prepared, and that is what we are called to be as our hearts cry out, “Come, Lord Jesus” (Revelation 22:20).

 The apostle Paul clearly taught that we receive the Holy Spirit the moment we receive Jesus Christ as our Savior.
First Corinthians 12:13 declares, “For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.” Romans 8:9 tells us that if a person does not possess the Holy Spirit, he or she does not belong to Christ: “You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you.
First Corinthians 12:13 declares, “For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.” Romans 8:9 tells us that if a person does not possess the Holy Spirit, he or she does not belong to Christ: “You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you.
Paul could not say that we all were baptized by one Spirit and all given one Spirit to drink if not all of the Corinthian believers possessed the Holy Spirit.
And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.” Ephesians 1:13-14 teaches us that the Holy Spirit is the seal of salvation for all those who believe: “Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.”
And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.” Ephesians 1:13-14 teaches us that the Holy Spirit is the seal of salvation for all those who believe: “Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.”
Many scriptures make it abundantly clear that our salvation is secured the moment we receive Christ as Savior.
Therefore, the possession of the Spirit is an identifying factor of the possession of salvation.
Romans 8:9 is even stronger, stating that if a person does not have the Spirit, he does not belong to Christ.
Further, the Holy Spirit could not be the “seal of salvation” (Ephesians 1:13-14) if He is not received at the moment of salvation.
The filling of the Spirit is an ongoing process in the Christian life.
This sometimes results in the baptism of the Spirit being confused with “receiving the Spirit” as an act subsequent to salvation.

 The timing of the rapture in relation to the tribulation is one of the most controversial issues in the church today.
The three primary views are pre-tribulational (the rapture occurs before the tribulation), mid-tribulational (the rapture occurs at or near the mid-point of the tribulation), and post-tribulational (the rapture occurs at the end of the tribulation).
A fourth view, commonly known as pre-wrath, is a slight modification of the mid-tribulational position.
First, it is important to recognize the purpose of the tribulation.
According to Daniel 9:27, there is a seventieth “seven” (seven years) that is still yet to come.
Daniel’s entire prophecy of the seventy sevens (Daniel 9:20-27) is speaking of the nation of Israel.
Daniel’s entire prophecy of the seventy sevens (Daniel 9:20-27) is speaking of the nation of Israel.
It is a time period in which God focuses His attention especially on Israel.
The seventieth seven, the tribulation, must also be a time when God deals specifically with Israel.
While this does not necessarily indicate that the church could not also be present, it does bring into question why the church would need to be on the earth during that time.
The primary Scripture passage on the rapture is 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18.
It states that all living believers, along with all believers who have died, will meet the Lord Jesus in the air and will be with Him forever.
The rapture is God’s removing of His people from the earth.
A few verses later, in 1 Thessalonians 5:9, Paul says, “For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.” The book of Revelation, which deals primarily with the time period of the tribulation, is a prophetic message of how God will pour out His wrath upon the earth during the tribulation.

The fact that God promises to deliver Christians from wrath shortly after promising to remove His people from the earth seems to link those two events together.
The fact that God promises to deliver Christians from wrath shortly after promising to remove His people from the earth seems to link those two events together.
Another crucial passage on the timing of the rapture is Revelation 3:10, in which Christ promises to deliver believers from the “hour of trial” that is going to come upon the earth.
This could mean two things.
Christ is promising to keep believers from the very time period that contains the trials, namely the tribulation.
Both are valid meanings of the Greek word translated “from.” However, it is important to recognize what believers are promised to be kept from.

It is not just the trial, but the “hour” of trial.
Christ is promising to keep believers from the very time period that contains the trials, namely the tribulation.
The purpose of the tribulation, the purpose of the rapture, the meaning of 1 Thessalonians 5:9, and the interpretation of Revelation 3:10 all give clear support to the pre-tribulational position.

 There are many Old Testament prophecies about Jesus Christ.
Some interpreters place the number of Messianic prophecies in the hundreds.
The following are those that are considered the clearest and most important.
                                                                                         Answer
Regarding Jesus’ birth—Isaiah 7:14: “Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.” Isaiah 9:6: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.
 Concerning Jesus’ ministry and death—Zechariah 9:9: “Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion!
 Concerning Jesus’ ministry and death—Zechariah 9:9: “Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion!
Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem!
Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
 Likely the clearest prophecy about Jesus is the entire 53rd chapter of Isaiah.
Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem!
Isaiah 53:3-7 is especially unmistakable: “He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.
Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted.
But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.
We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.”
 The “seventy sevens” prophecy in Daniel chapter 9 predicted the precise date that Jesus, the Messiah, would be “cut off.” Isaiah 50:6 accurately describes the beating that Jesus endured.
God the Son Incarnate: The Doctrine of Christ by Stephen Wellum
 The “seventy sevens” prophecy in Daniel chapter 9 predicted the precise date that Jesus, the Messiah, would be “cut off.” Isaiah 50:6 accurately describes the beating that Jesus endured.
    Is Jesus in the Old Testament?
Zechariah 12:10 predicts the “piercing” of the Messiah, which occurred after Jesus died on the cross.
Many more examples could be provided, but these will suffice.
The Old Testament most definitely prophesies the coming of Jesus as the Messiah.

 After Jesus said, “It is finished,” on the cross, “he bowed his head and gave up his spirit” (John 19:30).
 After Jesus said, “It is finished,” on the cross, “he bowed his head and gave up his spirit” (John 19:30).
 After Jesus said, “It is finished,” on the cross, “he bowed his head and gave up his spirit” (John 19:30).
So, after His death, Jesus went to the place of blessing where God is—heaven.
 After Jesus said, “It is finished,” on the cross, “he bowed his head and gave up his spirit” (John 19:30).
The clearest indication we have in Scripture of where Jesus was between His death and resurrection comes in His conversation on the cross with one of the thieves crucified next to Him.
In the discussion of where Jesus was for the three days between His death and resurrection, another passage is often mentioned.
First Peter 3:18–20 says, “Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared” (ESV).
In the discussion of where Jesus was for the three days between His death and resurrection, another passage is often mentioned.
Peter does not tell us what Jesus proclaimed to the imprisoned spirits, but it could not have been a message of redemption, since angels cannot be saved (Hebrews 2:16).
In the discussion of where Jesus was for the three days between His death and resurrection, another passage is often mentioned.
Some take this to mean that Jesus, sometime between His death and resurrection, went to hell/Hades and made an announcement of some type to the “spirits” imprisoned there.
So, after His death, Jesus went to the place of blessing where God is—heaven.
Some take this to mean that Jesus, sometime between His death and resurrection, went to hell/Hades and made an announcement of some type to the “spirits” imprisoned there.
Rather, Peter is giving parenthetical information about something Jesus had done previously in history, namely, that He had “in spirit” preached to the people of Noah’s day while they were still living on earth.
In this interpretation, the “spirits” are people currently in hell, but Peter is not saying Jesus made a special trip to Hades/hell to preach or proclaim anything.

The word now in 1 Peter 3:19 is provided for clarity in the Amplified Bible and the New American Standard Bibles of 1977 and 1995, and it contrasts with the “long ago” (NIV) and “formerly” (ESV) of 1 Peter 3:20.
That wicked generation heard the message, rejected it, perished in the flood, and are now in prison.

According to this alternate interpretation, Christ was in Noah (spiritually) when Noah preached to his doomed neighbors.
But there is another interpretation of the 1 Peter passage.
That is, after securing their salvation on the cross, Jesus brought Abraham, David, Joshua, Daniel, the beggar Lazarus, the thief on the cross, and everyone else who had previously been justified by faith, and led them from Hades (the abode of the dead in general) to their new spiritual home.
Another view of Ephesians 4 is that ascended on high is a straightforward reference to Jesus’ ascension.
In His triumph, Jesus had defeated and taken captive our spiritual enemies: the devil, death, and the curse of sin.
The word now in 1 Peter 3:19 is provided for clarity in the Amplified Bible and the New American Standard Bibles of 1977 and 1995, and it contrasts with the “long ago” (NIV) and “formerly” (ESV) of 1 Peter 3:20.
Ephesians 4:8–10 is another passage used in the discussion regarding Jesus’ activities in the three days between His death and resurrection.
The ESV puts it that Christ “led a host of captives.” Some say this refers to an event not elsewhere described in Scripture, namely, that Jesus gathered all the redeemed who were in paradise and took them to their permanent dwelling in heaven.
All of this is to say that the Bible gives scant information about what exactly Christ did for the three days between His death and resurrection.
We can also say with confidence that, His work of redemption finished, Jesus did not have to suffer in hell.

 The sect known today as the Jehovah’s Witnesses started out in Pennsylvania in 1870 as a Bible class led by Charles Taze Russell.
Russell named his group the “Millennial Dawn Bible Study,” and those who followed him were called “Bible students.” Charles T. Russell began writing a series of books he called “The Millennial Dawn,” which stretched to six volumes before his death and contained much of the theology Jehovah’s Witnesses now hold.

Group members were sometimes disparagingly called “Russellites.” After Russell’s death in 1916, Judge J. F. Rutherford, Russell’s successor, wrote the seventh and final volume of the “Millennial Dawn” series, “The Finished Mystery,” in 1917.

Jehovah’s Witnesses believe Jesus is Michael the archangel, the highest created being.
 What do Jehovah’s Witnesses believe?
Close scrutiny of their doctrinal position on such subjects as the deity of Christ, salvation, the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, and the atonement shows beyond a doubt that they do not hold to orthodox Christian positions on these subjects.
Jehovah’s Witnesses believe Jesus is Michael the archangel, the highest created being.
Jehovah’s Witnesses reject the Trinity, believing Jesus to be a created being and the Holy Spirit to essentially be the inanimate power of God.
This contradicts countless scriptures which declare salvation to be received by grace through faith (John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5).
Jehovah’s Witnesses reject the Trinity, believing Jesus to be a created being and the Holy Spirit to essentially be the inanimate power of God.
Jehovah’s Witnesses reject the concept of Christ’s substitutionary atonement and instead hold to a ransom theory, that Jesus’ death was a ransom payment for Adam’s sin.
How do the Jehovah’s Witnesses justify these unbiblical doctrines?
The New World Translation has gone through numerous editions, as the Jehovah’s Witnesses discover more and more Scriptures that contradict their doctrines.
The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society altered the text of the Bible to make it fit their false doctrine, rather than basing their doctrine on what the Bible actually teaches.

 Jesus clearly taught in John 3:16 that He will save anyone who believes in Him: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” This “whoever” includes you and every other person in the world.
The Bible says that, if salvation were based on our own efforts, no one could be saved: “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).
Psalm 143:2 adds, “No one living is righteous before you.” Romans 3:10 affirms, “There is no one righteous, not even one.”
 We cannot save ourselves.
Instead, we are saved when we believe in Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 2:8–9 teaches, “It is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.” We are saved by God’s grace, and grace, by definition, cannot be earned.
We do not deserve salvation; we simply receive it by faith.
God’s grace is enough to cover all sin (Romans 5:20).
The Bible is filled with examples of people who were saved from sinful backgrounds.
The apostle Paul wrote to Christians who had formerly been living in a variety of sinful conditions, including sexual immorality, idolatry, adultery, homosexuality, thievery, greed, and drunkenness.
But Paul tells them that, upon salvation, “You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (1 Corinthians 6:9–11).
The apostle Paul himself had been a persecutor of Christians, approving of the death of Stephen (Acts 8:1) and arresting Christians and throwing them into prison (Acts 8:3).
He would later write, “Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst” (1 Timothy 1:13–15).
God often chooses to save unlikely candidates to serve His purposes.
He saved a thief on a cross with only minutes to live (Luke 23:42–43), a persecutor of the church (Paul), a fisherman who had denied Him (Peter), a Roman soldier and his family (Acts 10), a runaway slave (Onesimus in Philemon), and many others.
There is no one beyond God’s ability to save (see Isaiah 50:2).
We must respond in faith and receive His free gift of eternal life.
Who can be saved?
One thing is for certain—you can, if you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior!
If you are not certain you have accepted Jesus as your Savior, you can respond right now with a prayer similar to this:

 A common argument from atheists and skeptics is that if all things need a cause, then God must also need a cause.
The question is tricky because it sneaks in the false assumption that God came from somewhere and then asks where that might be.
This is a slightly more sophisticated form of the basic question “Who made God?” Everyone knows that something does not come from nothing.

The answer is that the question does not even make sense.
It is like asking, “What does blue smell like?” Blue is not in the category of things that have a smell, so the question itself is flawed.

So, if there were ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence, then nothing would have ever come into existence.
God is the uncaused Being that caused everything else to come into existence.
How do we know this?
We know that from nothing, nothing comes.
So, if there were ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence, then nothing would have ever come into existence.
But things do exist.
Therefore, since there could never have been absolutely nothing, something had to have always been in existence.
That ever-existing thing is what we call God.
So, if there were ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence, then nothing would have ever come into existence.
God is the uncreated Creator who created the universe and everything in it.

 Unlike the question “Does God exist?” the question of whether Jesus Christ existed is asked by relatively few people.
Most accept that Jesus was truly a man who lived in Israel 2,000 years ago.
The debate begins with the discussion of Jesus’ full identity.
Almost every major religion teaches that Jesus was a prophet or a good teacher or a godly man.
S. Lewis in his book Mere Christianity writes the following: “I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him [Jesus Christ]: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God.’ That is the one thing we must not say.
But the Bible tells us that Jesus was infinitely more than a prophet, a good teacher, or a godly man.
A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.
C.
A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.
He has not left that option open to us.
But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.
You must make your choice.
So, who did Jesus claim to be?
You can shut him up for fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God.

Who does the Bible say He is?
Jesus said in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” At first glance, this might not seem to be a claim to be God.
However, look at the Jews’ reaction to His statement.
They tried to stone Him “for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God” (John 10:33).
The Jews rejected Jesus’ identity as God Incarnate, but they understood exactly what He was saying.
The Jews rejected Jesus’ identity as God Incarnate, but they understood exactly what He was saying.
In John 8:58 Jesus claims pre-existence, an attribute of God: “‘I tell you the truth,’ Jesus answered, ‘before Abraham was born, I am!’” In response to this statement, the Jews again took up stones to stone Jesus (John 8:59).
In claiming pre-existence, Jesus applied a name for God to Himself—I AM (see Exodus 3:14).
The Jews rejected Jesus’ identity as God Incarnate, but they understood exactly what He was saying.
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.

Why is the question of Jesus’ identity so important?
The apostle Paul describes Jesus as “our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).
Why does it matter whether Jesus is God?
God the Father bears witness of Jesus’ identity as well: “But about the Son he says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom’” (Hebrews 1:8; cf.
Old Testament prophecies such as Isaiah 9:6 announce the deity of Christ: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.
And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace” (emphasis added).
• Jesus had to be God because the Messiah was promised to be the “Holy One” (Psalm 16:5, NASB).
Several reasons:
 • As C. S. Lewis pointed out, if Jesus is not God, then Jesus is the worst of liars and untrustworthy in every way.
Jesus had to be both God and man.
• If Jesus is not God, then the apostles would likewise have been liars.
• Jesus had to be God because the Messiah was promised to be the “Holy One” (Psalm 16:5, NASB).
As God, Jesus could satisfy God’s wrath.
As a man, Jesus had the capability of dying.
As the God-man, Jesus is the perfect Mediator between heaven and earth (1 Timothy 2:5).

 There are many misconceptions about the identity of the Holy Spirit.
Some view the Holy Spirit as a mystical force.
Others understand the Holy Spirit as the impersonal power that God makes available to followers of Christ.
What does the Bible say about the identity of the Holy Spirit?
Simply put, the Bible declares that the Holy Spirit is God.
The Bible also tells us that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, a being with a mind, emotions, and a will.
The fact that the Holy Spirit is God is clearly seen in many Scriptures, including Acts 5:3-4.
In this verse Peter confronts Ananias as to why he lied to the Holy Spirit and tells him that he had “not lied to men but to God.” It is a clear declaration that lying to the Holy Spirit is lying to God.
Simply put, the Bible declares that the Holy Spirit is God.
We can also know that the Holy Spirit is God because He possesses the characteristics of God.
For example, His omnipresence is seen in Psalm 139:7-8, “Where can I go from your Spirit?
Where can I flee from your presence?
Where can I flee from your presence?
If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.” Then in 1 Corinthians 2:10-11, we see the characteristic of omniscience in the Holy Spirit.
In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.”
 We can know that the Holy Spirit is indeed a divine person because He possesses a mind, emotions, and a will.
The Holy Spirit thinks and knows (1 Corinthians 2:10).
The Holy Spirit can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30).
    Is the Holy Spirit a person?
He makes decisions according to His will (1 Corinthians 12:7-11).
The Holy Spirit is God, the third Person of the Trinity.
As God, the Holy Spirit can truly function as the Comforter and Counselor that Jesus promised He would be (John 14:16, 26, 15:26).

 The Bible does not specifically say who Cain’s wife was.
The only possible answer is that Cain’s wife was his sister or niece or great-niece, etc.
The Bible does not say how old Cain was when he killed Abel (Genesis 4:8).
Since they were both farmers, they were likely both full-grown adults, possibly with families of their own.
Adam and Eve surely had given birth to more children than just Cain and Abel at the time Abel was killed.
They definitely had many more children later (Genesis 5:4).
The fact that Cain was scared for his own life after he killed Abel (Genesis 4:14) indicates that there were likely many other children and perhaps even grandchildren of Adam and Eve already living at that time.
Cain’s wife (Genesis 4:17) was a daughter or granddaughter of Adam and Eve.
Since Adam and Eve were the first (and only) human beings, their children would have no other choice than to intermarry.
The reason that incest today often results in genetic abnormalities is that when two people of similar genetics (i.e., a brother and sister) have children together, there is a high risk of their recessive characteristics becoming dominant.
When people from different families have children, it is highly unlikely that both parents will carry the same recessive traits.
The human genetic code has become increasingly “polluted” over the centuries as genetic defects are multiplied, amplified, and passed down from generation to generation.
Adam and Eve did not have any genetic defects, and that enabled them and the first few generations of their descendants to have a far greater quality of health than we do now.
Adam and Eve’s children had few, if any, genetic defects.
As a result, it was safe for them to intermarry.

 Genesis 6:1-4 refers to the sons of God and the daughters of men.
There have been several suggestions as to who the sons of God were and why the children they had with daughters of men grew into a race of giants (that is what the word Nephilim seems to indicate).
The three primary views on the identity of the sons of God are 1) they were fallen angels, 2) they were powerful human rulers, or 3) they were godly descendants of Seth intermarrying with wicked descendants of Cain.
Giving weight to the first theory is the fact that in the Old Testament the phrase “sons of God” always refers to angels (Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7).
A potential problem with this is in Matthew 22:30, which indicates that angels do not marry.
The Bible gives us no reason to believe that angels have a gender or are able to reproduce.
The other two views do not present this problem.
The weakness of views 2) and 3) is that ordinary human males marrying ordinary human females does not account for why the offspring were “giants” or “heroes of old, men of renown.” Further, why would God decide to bring the flood on the earth (Genesis 6:5-7) when God had never forbidden powerful human males or descendants of Seth to marry ordinary human females or descendants of Cain?
The oncoming judgment of Genesis 6:5-7 is linked to what took place in Genesis 6:1-4.
Only the obscene, perverse marriage of fallen angels with human females would seem to justify such a harsh judgment.
As previously noted, the weakness of the first view is that Matthew 22:30 declares, “At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” However, the text does not say “angels are not able to marry.” Rather, it indicates only that angels do not marry.
Second, Matthew 22:30 is referring to the “angels in heaven.” It is not referring to fallen angels, who do not care about God’s created order and actively seek ways to disrupt God’s plan.
The fact that God’s holy angels do not marry or engage in sexual relations does not mean the same is true of Satan and his demons.
View 1) is the most likely position.
Yes, it is an interesting “contradiction” to say that angels are sexless and then to say that the “sons of God” were fallen angels who procreated with human females.
However, while angels are spiritual beings (Hebrews 1:14), they can appear in human, physical form (Mark 16:5).
The men of Sodom and Gomorrah wanted to have sex with the two angels who were with Lot (Genesis 19:1-5).
It is plausible that angels are capable of taking on human form, even to the point of replicating human sexuality and possibly even reproduction.
Why do the fallen angels not do this more often?
It seems that God imprisoned the fallen angels who committed this evil sin, so that the other fallen angels would not do the same (as described in Jude 6).
Earlier Hebrew interpreters and apocryphal and pseudopigraphal writings are unanimous in holding to the view that fallen angels are the “sons of God” mentioned in Genesis 6:1-4.
This by no means closes the debate.
However, the view that Genesis 6:1-4 involves fallen angels mating with human females has a strong contextual, grammatical, and historical basis.

 People’s beliefs concerning Satan range from the silly to the abstract—from a little red guy with horns who sits on your shoulder urging you to sin, to an expression used to describe the personification of evil.
The Bible, however, gives us a clear portrait of who Satan is and how he affects our lives.
Put simply, the Bible defines Satan as an angelic being who fell from his position in heaven due to sin and is now completely opposed to God, doing all in his power to thwart God’s purposes.
Satan was created as a holy angel.
Isaiah 14:12 possibly gives Satan’s pre-fall name as Lucifer.
Ezekiel 28:12-14 describes Satan as having been created a cherub, apparently the highest created angel.
He became arrogant in his beauty and status and decided he wanted to sit on a throne above that of God (Isaiah 14:13-14; Ezekiel 28:15; 1 Timothy 3:6).
He became arrogant in his beauty and status and decided he wanted to sit on a throne above that of God (Isaiah 14:13-14; Ezekiel 28:15; 1 Timothy 3:6).
Satan’s pride led to his fall.
Notice the many “I will” statements in Isaiah 14:12-15.
Because of his sin, God permanently removed Satan from his exalted position and role.
Satan became the ruler of this world and the prince of the power of the air (John 12:31; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Ephesians 2:2).
He is an accuser (Revelation 12:10), a tempter (Matthew 4:3; 1 Thessalonians 3:5), and a deceiver (Genesis 3; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Revelation 20:3).
He is an accuser (Revelation 12:10), a tempter (Matthew 4:3; 1 Thessalonians 3:5), and a deceiver (Genesis 3; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Revelation 20:3).
He is an accuser (Revelation 12:10), a tempter (Matthew 4:3; 1 Thessalonians 3:5), and a deceiver (Genesis 3; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Revelation 20:3).
His very name means “adversary” or “one who opposes.” Another of his titles, the devil, means “slanderer.”
Satan is the ultimate source behind every false cult and world religion.

 Jesus’ genealogy is given in two places in Scripture: Matthew 1 and Luke 3:23-38.
Matthew traces the genealogy from Jesus to Abraham.
Luke traces the genealogy from Jesus to Adam.
However, there is good reason to believe that Matthew and Luke are in fact tracing entirely different genealogies.
For example, Matthew gives Joseph’s father as Jacob (Matthew 1:16), while Luke gives Joseph’s father as Heli (Luke 3:23).
Matthew traces the line through David’s son Solomon (Matthew 1:6), while Luke traces the line through David’s son Nathan (Luke 3:31).
In fact, between David and Jesus, the only names the genealogies have in common are Shealtiel and Zerubbabel (Matthew 1:12; Luke 3:27).
Some point to these differences as evidence of errors in the Bible.
However, the Jews were meticulous record keepers, especially in regard to genealogies.
It is inconceivable that Matthew and Luke could build two entirely contradictory genealogies of the same lineage.
Again, from David through Jesus, the genealogies are completely different.
Even the reference to Shealtiel and Zerubbabel likely refer to different individuals of the same names.
Matthew gives Shealtiel’s father as Jeconiah while Luke gives Shealtiel’s father as Neri.
It would be normal for a man named Shealtiel to name his son Zerubbabel in light of the famous individuals of those names (see the books of Ezra and Nehemiah).
One explanation, held by the church historian Eusebius, is that Matthew is tracing the primary, or biological, lineage while Luke is taking into account an occurrence of “levirate marriage.” If a man died without having any sons, it was tradition for the man’s brother to marry the widow and have a son who would carry on the deceased man’s name.
According to Eusebius’s theory, Melchi (Luke 3:24) and Matthan (Matthew 1:15) were married at different times to the same woman (tradition names her Estha).
This would make Heli (Luke 3:23) and Jacob (Matthew 1:15) half-brothers.
Heli then died without a son, and so his (half-)brother Jacob married Heli’s widow, who gave birth to Joseph.
This would make Joseph the “son of Heli” legally and the “son of Jacob” biologically.
Thus, Matthew and Luke are both recording the same genealogy (Joseph’s), but Luke follows the legal lineage while Matthew follows the biological.
Most conservative Bible scholars today take a different view, namely, that Luke is recording Mary’s genealogy and Matthew is recording Joseph’s.
Matthew is following the line of Joseph (Jesus’ legal father), through David’s son Solomon, while Luke is following the line of Mary (Jesus’ blood relative), through David’s son Nathan.
Since there was no specific Koine Greek word for “son-in-law,” Joseph was called the “son of Heli” by marriage to Mary, Heli’s daughter.
Through either Mary’s or Joseph’s line, Jesus is a descendant of David and therefore eligible to be the Messiah.
Tracing a genealogy through the mother’s side is unusual, but so was the virgin birth.
Luke’s explanation is that Jesus was the son of Joseph, “so it was thought” (Luke 3:23).

God created Adam and Eve to be “free” beings, able to make decisions, able to choose between good and evil.
Adam and Eve were free to do anything they wanted, except eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis 2:16-17, “And the LORD God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.’” If God had not given Adam and Eve the choice, they would have essentially been robots, simply doing what they were programmed to do.
God created Adam and Eve to be “free” beings, able to make decisions, able to choose between good and evil.
In order for Adam and Eve to truly be free, they had to have a choice.
There was nothing essentially evil about the tree or the fruit of the tree.
It is unlikely that the fruit, in and of itself, gave Adam and Eve any further knowledge.
Genesis 2:16-17, “And the LORD God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.’” If God had not given Adam and Eve the choice, they would have essentially been robots, simply doing what they were programmed to do.
Adam and Eve chose, of their own free will, to disobey God and eat the forbidden fruit.

May we echo the words of the Apostle Paul in Romans 7:24-25, “What a wretched man I am!
God knew that Adam and Eve would sin and would thereby bring evil, suffering, and death into the world.
The results—evil, sin, suffering, sickness, and death—have plagued the world ever since.
Adam and Eve’s decision is what ultimately required Jesus Christ to die on the cross and shed His blood on our behalf.
Through faith in Christ, we can be free from sin’s consequences, and ultimately free from sin itself.

 Jesus suffered severely throughout His trials, torture, and crucifixion (Matthew 27; Mark 15; Luke 23; John 19).
His suffering was physical: Isaiah 52:14 declares, “There were many who were appalled at Him—His appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness.” His suffering was emotional: “All the disciples deserted him and fled” (Matthew 26:56).
His suffering was spiritual: “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us” (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus had the weight of the sins of the entire world on Him (1 John 2:2).
It was sin that caused Jesus to cry out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46).
Jesus’ brutal physical suffering was augmented by His having to bear the guilt of our sins and die to pay our penalty (Romans 5:8).
Jesus told His disciples that His suffering was certain: “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life” (Luke 9:22; cf.
17:25).
Note the word must—He must suffer, and He must be killed.
The suffering of Christ was God’s plan for the salvation of the world.
Psalm 22:14–18 details some of the suffering of the Messiah: “I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint.
My heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.
Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet.
I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me.
They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.” In order for this and other prophecies to be fulfilled, Jesus had to suffer.
Why did Jesus have to suffer so badly?
The principle of the innocent dying for the guilty was established in the garden of Eden: Adam and Eve received garments of animal skin to cover their shame (Genesis 3:21)—thus, blood was shed in Eden.
Later, this principle was set in the Mosaic Law: “It is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life” (Leviticus 17:11; cf.
Hebrews 9:22).
Jesus had to suffer because suffering is part of sacrifice, and Jesus was “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29).
Jesus’ physical torture was part of the payment required for our sins.
We are redeemed “with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect” (1 Peter 1:19).
Jesus’ suffering on the cross showed the devastating nature of sin, the wrath of God, the cruelty of humanity, and the hatred of Satan.
At Calvary, mankind was allowed to do his worst to the Son of Man as He became the Redeemer of mankind.
Satan may have thought he had won a great victory, but it was through the cross that the Son of God triumphed over Satan, sin, and death.
“Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out” (John 12:31; cf.
Colossians 2:15).
Jesus suffered and died in order to secure salvation for all who would believe.
The night of His arrest, as Jesus prayed in Gethsemane, He committed His all to the task: “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done” (Luke 22:42).
The cup of suffering was not taken from Christ; He drank it all for us.
There was no other way for us to be saved.

 Questions about Jesus Christ
                                                                                         Answer
 It is somewhat of a mystery why people in early chapters of Genesis lived such long lives.
The genealogy in Genesis 5 records the line of the godly descendants of Seth—the line that would eventually produce the Messiah.
God possibly blessed this line with especially long life as a result of their godliness and obedience.
While this is a possible explanation, the Bible nowhere specifically limits the long lifespans to the individuals mentioned in Genesis chapter 5.
Further, other than Enoch, Genesis 5 does not identify any of the individuals as being especially godly.
It is likely that everyone during that time lived several hundred years.
Several factors may have contributed to this.
The genealogy in Genesis 5 records the line of the godly descendants of Seth—the line that would eventually produce the Messiah.
Something happened at the global flood to shorten men’s lifespans.
According to the canopy theory, the water “above the firmament” (Genesis 1:7, KJV) created a greenhouse effect and blocked much of the radiation that now hits the earth, resulting in ideal living conditions.
Several factors may have contributed to this.
At the time of the flood, the water canopy was poured out on the earth (Genesis 7:11), ending the ideal environment.
Compare the lifespans before the flood (Genesis 5:1–32) with those after the flood (Genesis 11:10–32).
Immediately after the flood, the ages decreased dramatically and then kept decreasing.
Another consideration is that, in the first few generations after creation, the human genetic code had developed few defects.
Adam and Eve were created perfect.
They were surely highly resistant to disease and illness.
Their descendants would have inherited these advantages, albeit to lesser degrees.
Over time, as a result of sin, the human genetic code became increasingly corrupted, and human beings became more and more susceptible to death and disease.
This would also have resulted in drastically reduced lifespans.

One of those effects is injustice and seemingly senseless suffering.
At the outset, we must acknowledge that human beings, who are not eternal, infinite, or omniscient, cannot expect to fully understand God’s purposes and ways.

What was Job’s reaction?
“Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him” (Job 13:15).
“The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised” (Job 1:21).
Job did not understand why God had allowed the things He did, but he knew God was good and therefore continued to trust in Him.
Ultimately, that should be our reaction as well.
Why do bad things happen to good people?
As hard as it is to acknowledge, we must remember that there are no “good” people, in the absolute sense of the word.
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
All of us are tainted by and infected with sin (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23; 1 John 1:8).
Romans 5:8 declares, “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Despite the sinful nature of the people of this world, God still loves us.
‘He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.’ When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats.
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.

the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.
If we receive Jesus Christ as Savior (John 3:16; Romans 10:9), we will be forgiven and promised an eternal home in heaven (Romans 8:1).

We walk by faith, not by sight.
4) Bad things happen to good people, and the worst things happened to the best Person.
We live in a fallen world, and we experience the effects of the fall.
Whether or not we understand His reasons, we must remember that God is good, just, loving, and merciful (Psalm 135:3).
Often, bad things happen to us that we simply cannot understand.
Instead of doubting God’s goodness, our reaction should be to trust Him.
“Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight” (Proverbs 3:5–6).

 Why does God allow earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, tsunamis, typhoons, cyclones, mudslides, wildfires, and other natural disasters?
Tragedies cause many people to question God’s goodness.
It is distressing that natural disasters are often termed “acts of God” while no “credit” is given to God for years, decades, or even centuries of peaceful weather.
God created the whole universe and the laws of nature (Genesis 1:1).
God created the whole universe and the laws of nature (Genesis 1:1).
Most natural disasters are a result of these laws at work.
Hurricanes, typhoons, and tornados are the results of divergent weather patterns colliding.
Earthquakes are the result of the earth’s plate structure shifting.
Earthquakes are the result of the earth’s plate structure shifting.
The Bible proclaims that Jesus Christ holds all of nature together (Colossians 1:16-17).
Could God prevent natural disasters?
Absolutely!
Does God sometimes influence the weather?
Absolutely!
Yes, as we see in Deuteronomy 11:17 and James 5:17.
Numbers 16:30-34 shows us that God sometimes causes natural disasters as a judgment against sin.
The book of Revelation describes many events which could definitely be described as natural disasters (Revelation chapters 6, 8, and 16).
Is every natural disaster a punishment from God?
Absolutely not.
In much the same way that God allows evil people to commit evil acts, God allows the earth to reflect the consequences sin has had on creation.
We can understand why natural disasters occur.
Romans 8:19-21 tells us, “The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.
For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.” The fall of humanity into sin had effects on everything, including the world we inhabit.
Everything in creation is subject to “frustration” and “decay.” Sin is the ultimate cause of natural disasters just as it is the cause of death, disease, and suffering.
Churches are usually filled after disasters as people realize how tenuous their lives really are and how life can be taken away in an instant.

 First, it is important to understand that not all Arabs are Muslims, and not all Muslims are Arabs.
While a majority of Arabs are Muslims, there are many non-Muslim Arabs.
Further, there are significantly more non-Arab Muslims in areas such as Indonesia and Malaysia than there are Arab Muslims.
Second, it is important to remember that not all Arabs hate Jews, not all Muslims hate Jews, and not all Jews hate Arabs and Muslims.
We must be careful to avoid stereotyping people.
However, generally speaking, Arabs and Muslims have a dislike of and distrust for Jews, and vice-versa.
If there is an explicit biblical explanation for this animosity, it goes all the way back to Abraham.
The Jews are descendants of Abraham’s son Isaac.
The Arabs are descendants of Abraham’s son Ishmael.
With Ishmael being the son of a slave woman (Genesis 16:1–16) and Isaac being the promised son who would inherit the blessings of Abraham (Genesis 21:1–3), obviously there would be some animosity between the two sons.
As a result of Ishmael’s mocking Isaac (Genesis 21:9), Sarah talked Abraham into sending Hagar and Ishmael away (Genesis 21:11–21).
Likely, this caused even more contempt in Ishmael’s heart toward Isaac.
An angel told Hagar that Ishmael would be the father of a great nation (Genesis 21:18) and, interestingly, that Ishmael would be “a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers” (Genesis 16:12).
However, the ancient root of bitterness between Isaac and Ishmael does not explain all of the hostility between Jews and Arabs today.
The religion of Islam, which a majority of Arabs follow, has made the hostility predicted of Ishmael more profound.
The Qur’an contains somewhat contradictory instructions for Muslims regarding Jews.
At one point it instructs Muslims to treat Jews as brothers and at another point commands Muslims to attack Jews who refuse to convert to Islam.
The Qur’an also introduces a conflict as to which son of Abraham was truly the son of promise.
The Hebrew Scriptures say it was Isaac.
The Qur’an says it was Ishmael.
The Qur’an teaches that it was Ishmael whom Abraham almost sacrificed to the Lord, not Isaac (in contradiction to Genesis 22).
This debate over who was the son of promise further contributes to today’s hostility.
Another root of the conflict between Jews and Arabs is political.
After World War II, when the United Nations gave a portion of the land of Israel to the Jewish people, the land was ruled by the British and primarily inhabited by Arabs (although one third of the population was Jewish).
Most Arabs protested vehemently against the new Israeli state, even as they refused an Arab Palestinian state offered as part of the UN plan.
Arab nations including Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Syria attacked Israel in an attempt to drive them into the sea, but they were defeated.
The defeat of the Arab forces soon became a human tragedy when the surrounding Arab nations refused to absorb the Arab refugees from Israel.
Ever since 1948, there has been great hostility between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
The tensions have been stoked by political rhetoric and the existence of groups such as Hamas with their continuing obsession with wiping out “the Zionist entity” and “reversing the results of 1948.”
 Israel exists on one tiny piece of land surrounded by much larger Arab nations such as Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt.
It is our viewpoint that, biblically speaking, Israel has a right to exist as a nation in its own land that God gave to the descendants of Jacob, grandson of Abraham (Genesis 12:7).
While there is no easy solution to the conflict in the Middle East, Psalm 122:6 declares, “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: May those who love you be secure.”

 The Bible tells us we need to attend church so we can worship God with other believers and be taught His Word for our spiritual growth.
Church is the place where believers can love one another (1 John 4:12), encourage one another (Hebrews 3:13), “spur” one another to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), serve one another (Galatians 5:13), instruct one another (Romans 15:14), honor one another (Romans 12:10), and be kind and compassionate to one another (Ephesians 4:32).

When a person trusts Jesus Christ for salvation, he or she is made a member of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27).
For a church body to function properly, all of its “body parts” need to be present and working (1 Corinthians 12:14–20).
A believer will never reach full spiritual maturity without having that outlet for his gifts, and we all need the assistance and encouragement of other believers (1 Corinthians 12:21–26).
For these reasons and more, church attendance, participation, and fellowship should be regular aspects of a believer’s life.
Weekly church attendance is in no sense “required” for believers, but someone who belongs to Christ should have a desire to worship God, receive His Word, and fellowship with other believers.

 It is important to understand how the word “jealous” is used.
                                                                                         Answer
Its use in Exodus 20:5 to describe God is different from how it is used to describe the sin of jealousy (Galatians 5:20).
                                                                                         Answer
Its use in Exodus 20:5 to describe God is different from how it is used to describe the sin of jealousy (Galatians 5:20).
A person might be jealous or envious of another person because he or she has a nice car or home (possessions).
Another example would be that one person might be jealous or envious of another because of his or her beauty.

In Exodus 20:5, it is not that God is jealous or envious because someone has something He wants or needs.
In Exodus 20:5, it is not that God is jealous or envious because someone has something He wants or needs.
Exodus 20:4-5 says, “You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
It is a sin when we desire, or we are envious, or we are jealous of someone because he has something that we do not have.
It is a different use of the word “jealous” when God says He is jealous.
It is a different use of the word “jealous” when God says He is jealous.
God is possessive of the worship and service that belong to Him.
It is a sin (as God points out in this commandment) to worship or serve anything other than God.
It is a sin when we desire, or we are envious, or we are jealous of someone because he has something that we do not have.
It is a different use of the word “jealous” when God says He is jealous.
This type of jealousy is not sinful.
Perhaps a practical example will help us understand the difference.
If a husband sees another man flirting with his wife, he is right to be jealous, for only he has the right to flirt with his wife.
Rather, it is entirely appropriate.

 At the very heart of this question lies a fundamental misunderstanding of what both the Old and New Testaments reveal about the nature of God.
Another way of expressing this same basic thought is when people say, “The God of the Old Testament is a God of wrath while the God of the New Testament is a God of love.” The fact that the Bible is God’s progressive revelation of Himself to us through historical events and through His relationship with people throughout history might contribute to misconceptions about what God is like in the Old Testament as compared to the New Testament.

For example, throughout the Old Testament, God is declared to be a “compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,” (Exodus 34:6; Numbers 14:18; Deuteronomy 4:31; Nehemiah 9:17; Psalm 86:5, 15; 108:4; 145:8; Joel 2:13).
Yet in the New Testament, God’s loving-kindness and mercy are manifested even more fully through the fact that “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
Throughout the Old Testament, we also see God dealing with Israel the same way a loving father deals with a child.

Yet, each time He would deliver them once they had repented of their idolatry.
So, clearly, God is no different in the Old Testament than He is in the New Testament.
For example, Hebrews 12:6 tells us that “the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”
Throughout the Old Testament, we also see God dealing with Israel the same way a loving father deals with a child.
For example, Hebrews 12:6 tells us that “the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”
As we read and study the Bible, it becomes clear that God is the same in the Old and New Testaments.
God by His very nature is immutable (unchanging).
While we might see one aspect of His nature revealed in certain passages of Scripture more than other aspects, God Himself does not change.
God by His very nature is immutable (unchanging).
As we read and study the Bible, it becomes clear that God is the same in the Old and New Testaments.
Even though the Bible is 66 individual books written on two (or possibly three) continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years by more than 40 authors, it remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction.
In it we see how a loving, merciful, and just God deals with sinful men in all kinds of situations.
Truly, the Bible is God’s love letter to mankind.
God’s love for His creation, especially for mankind, is evident all through Scripture.
Throughout the Bible we see God lovingly and mercifully calling people into a special relationship with Himself, not because they deserve it, but because He is a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.
Yet we also see a holy and righteous God who is the Judge of all those who disobey His Word and refuse to worship Him, turning instead to worship gods of their own creation (Romans chapter 1).
Because of God’s righteous and holy character, all sin—past, present, and future—must be judged.
Throughout the Bible we see God lovingly and mercifully calling people into a special relationship with Himself, not because they deserve it, but because He is a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.
We see this wonderful truth in verses like 1 John 4:10: “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.” In the Old Testament, God provided a sacrificial system whereby atonement could be made for sin.
However, this sacrificial system was only temporary and merely looked forward to the coming of Jesus Christ who would die on the cross to make a complete substitutionary atonement for sin.
The Savior who was promised in the Old Testament is fully revealed in the New Testament.
Only envisioned in the Old Testament, the ultimate expression of God’s love, the sending of His Son Jesus Christ, is revealed in all its glory in the New Testament.
Both the Old and the New Testaments were given “to make us wise unto salvation” (2 Timothy 3:15).
When we study the Testaments closely, it is evident that God “does not change like shifting shadows” (James 1:17).

 The doctrine of the virgin birth is crucially important (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:27, 34).
First, let’s look at how Scripture describes the event.
In response to Mary’s question, “How will this be?” (Luke 1:34), Gabriel says, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you” (Luke 1:35).
Matthew states that the virgin “was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 1:18).
Matthew states that the virgin “was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 1:18).
Galatians 4:4 also teaches the Virgin Birth: “God sent His Son, born of a woman.”
 From these passages, it is certainly clear that Jesus’ birth was the result of the Holy Spirit working within Mary’s body.
The immaterial (the Spirit) and the material (Mary’s womb) were both involved.
Mary, of course, could not impregnate herself, and in that sense she was simply a “vessel.” Only God could perform the miracle of the Incarnation.
 From these passages, it is certainly clear that Jesus’ birth was the result of the Holy Spirit working within Mary’s body.
However, denying a physical connection between Mary and Jesus would imply that Jesus was not truly human.
Scripture teaches that Jesus was fully human, with a physical body like ours.
This He received from Mary.
The Virgin Birth circumvented the transmission of the sin nature and allowed the eternal God to become a perfect man.
At the same time, Jesus was fully God, with an eternal, sinless nature (John 1:14; 1 Timothy 3:16; Hebrews 2:14-17.)
Jesus was not born in sin; that is, He had no sin nature (Hebrews 7:26).
It would seem that the sin nature is passed down from generation to generation through the father (Romans 5:12, 17, 19).
The Virgin Birth circumvented the transmission of the sin nature and allowed the eternal God to become a perfect man.

For one thing, prayer is a form of serving God (Luke 2:36-38) and obeying Him.
If Jesus thought it was worthwhile to pray, we should also.
We pray in preparation for major decisions (Luke 6:12-13); to overcome demonic barriers (Matthew 17:14-21); to gather workers for the spiritual harvest (Luke 10:2); to gain strength to overcome temptation (Matthew 26:41); and to obtain the means of strengthening others spiritually (Ephesians 6:18-19).
If Jesus thought it was worthwhile to pray, we should also.
Another reason to pray is that God intends prayer to be the means of obtaining His solutions in a number of situations.

We come to God with our specific requests, and we have God’s promise that our prayers are not in vain, even if we do not receive specifically what we asked for (Matthew 6:6; Romans 8:26-27).
He has promised that when we ask for things that are in accordance with His will, He will give us what we ask for (1 John 5:14-15).
Sometimes He delays His answers according to His wisdom and for our benefit.
In these situations, we are to be diligent and persistent in prayer (Matthew 7:7; Luke 18:1-8).
Prayer should not be seen as our means of getting God to do our will on earth, but rather as a means of getting God’s will done on earth.
God’s wisdom far exceeds our own.
For situations in which we do not know God’s will specifically, prayer is a means of discerning His will.
If the Syrian woman with the demon-influenced daughter had not prayed to Christ, her daughter would not have been made whole (Mark 7:26-30).
If the blind man outside Jericho had not called out to Christ, he would have remained blind (Luke 18:35-43).
God has said that we often go without because we do not ask (James 4:2).
In one sense, prayer is like sharing the gospel with people.
We do not know who will respond to the message of the gospel until we share it.
In the same way, we will never see the results of answered prayer unless we pray.
A lack of prayer demonstrates a lack of faith and a lack of trust in God’s Word.
We pray to demonstrate our faith in God, that He will do as He has promised in His Word and bless our lives abundantly more than we could ask or hope for (Ephesians 3:20).
Prayer is our primary means of seeing God work in others' lives.
Because it is our means of “plugging into” God’s power, it is our means of defeating Satan and his army that we are powerless to overcome by ourselves.
Therefore, may God find us often before His throne, for we have a high priest in heaven who can identify with all that we go through (Hebrews 4:15-16).
We have His promise that the fervent prayer of a righteous man accomplishes much (James 5:16-18).
May God glorify His name in our lives as we believe in Him enough to come to Him often in prayer.

 It is a fairly well-established fact that Jesus Christ was publicly executed in Judea in the 1st Century A.D., under Pontius Pilate, by means of crucifixion, at the behest of the Jewish Sanhedrin.
The non-Christian historical accounts of Flavius Josephus, Cornelius Tacitus, Lucian of Samosata, Maimonides and even the Jewish Sanhedrin corroborate the early Christian eyewitness accounts of these important historical aspects of the death of Jesus Christ.
As for His resurrection, there are several lines of evidence which make for a compelling case.
The late jurisprudential prodigy and international statesman Sir Lionel Luckhoo (of The Guinness Book of World Records fame for his unprecedented 245 consecutive defense murder trial acquittals) epitomized Christian enthusiasm and confidence in the strength of the case for the resurrection when he wrote, “I have spent more than 42 years as a defense trial lawyer appearing in many parts of the world and am still in active practice.
I have been fortunate to secure a number of successes in jury trials and I say unequivocally the evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is so overwhelming that it compels acceptance by proof which leaves absolutely no room for doubt.”
 The secular community’s response to the same evidence has been predictably apathetic in accordance with their steadfast commitment to methodological naturalism.
For those unfamiliar with the term, methodological naturalism is the human endeavor of explaining everything in terms of natural causes and natural causes only.
If an alleged historical event defies natural explanation (e.g., a miraculous resurrection), secular scholars generally treat it with overwhelming skepticism, regardless of the evidence, no matter how favorable and compelling it may be.
In our view, such an unwavering allegiance to natural causes regardless of substantive evidence to the contrary is not conducive to an impartial (and therefore adequate) investigation of the evidence.
We agree with Dr. Wernher von Braun and numerous others who still believe that forcing a popular philosophical predisposition upon the evidence hinders objectivity.
Or in the words of Dr. von Braun, “To be forced to believe only one conclusion… would violate the very objectivity of science itself.”
 Having said that, let us now examine several lines of evidence for Christ’s resurrection.
 To begin with, we have demonstrably sincere eyewitness testimony.
Early Christian apologists cited hundreds of eyewitnesses, some of whom documented their own alleged experiences.
Many of these eyewitnesses willfully and resolutely endured prolonged torture and death rather than repudiate their testimony.
This fact attests to their sincerity, ruling out deception on their part.
According to the historical record (The Book of Acts 4:1-17; Pliny’s Letters to Trajan X, 97, etc) most Christians could end their suffering simply by renouncing the faith.
Instead, it seems that most opted to endure the suffering and proclaim Christ’s resurrection unto death.
Granted, while martyrdom is remarkable, it is not necessarily compelling.
It does not validate a belief so much as it authenticates a believer (by demonstrating his or her sincerity in a tangible way).
What makes the earliest Christian martyrs remarkable is that they knew whether or not what they were professing was true.
They either saw Jesus Christ alive-and-well after His death or they did not.
This is extraordinary.
If it was all just a lie, why would so many perpetuate it given their circumstances?
Why would they all knowingly cling to such an unprofitable lie in the face of persecution, imprisonment, torture, and death?
While the September 11, 2001, suicide hijackers undoubtedly believed what they professed (as evidenced by their willingness to die for it), they could not and did not know if it was true.
They put their faith in traditions passed down to them over many generations.
In contrast, the early Christian martyrs were the first generation.
It certainly was not financial gain.
Among the most illustrious of the professed eyewitnesses were the Apostles.
They collectively underwent an undeniable change following the alleged post-resurrection appearances of Christ.
Immediately following His crucifixion, they hid in fear for their lives.
Following the resurrection they took to the streets, boldly proclaiming the resurrection despite intensifying persecution.
What accounts for their sudden and dramatic change?
It certainly was not financial gain.
The Apostles gave up everything they had to preach the resurrection, including their lives.
 A second line of evidence concerns the conversion of certain key skeptics, most notably Paul and James.
Paul was of his own admission a violent persecutor of the early Church.
After what he described as an encounter with the resurrected Christ, Paul underwent an immediate and drastic change from a vicious persecutor of the Church to one of its most prolific and selfless defenders.
Like many early Christians, Paul suffered impoverishment, persecution, beatings, imprisonment, and execution for his steadfast commitment to Christ’s resurrection.
James was skeptical, though not as hostile as Paul.
A purported post-resurrection encounter with Christ turned him into an inimitable believer, a leader of the Church in Jerusalem.
We still have what scholars generally accept to be one of his letters to the early Church.
Like many early Christians, Paul suffered impoverishment, persecution, beatings, imprisonment, and execution for his steadfast commitment to Christ’s resurrection.
Like Paul, James willingly suffered and died for his testimony, a fact which attests to the sincerity of his belief (see The Book of Acts and Josephus’ Antiquities of the Jews XX, ix, 1).
 A third line and fourth line of evidence concern enemy attestation to the empty tomb and the fact that faith in the resurrection took root in Jerusalem.
Jesus was publicly executed and buried in Jerusalem.
It would have been impossible for faith in His resurrection to take root in Jerusalem while His body was still in the tomb where the Sanhedrin could exhume it, put it on public display, and thereby expose the hoax.
Instead, the Sanhedrin accused the disciples of stealing the body, apparently in an effort to explain its disappearance (and therefore an empty tomb).
How do we explain the fact of the empty tomb?
Here are the three most common explanations:
 First, the disciples stole the body.
If this were the case, they would have known the resurrection was a hoax.
Like Paul, James willingly suffered and died for his testimony, a fact which attests to the sincerity of his belief (see The Book of Acts and Josephus’ Antiquities of the Jews XX, ix, 1).
All of the professed eyewitnesses would have known that they hadn’t really seen Christ and were therefore lying.
With so many conspirators, surely someone would have confessed, if not to end his own suffering then at least to end the suffering of his friends and family.
The first generation of Christians were absolutely brutalized, especially following the conflagration in Rome in A.D. 64 (a fire which Nero allegedly ordered to make room for the expansion of his palace, but which he blamed on the Christians in Rome in an effort to exculpate himself).
 “Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace.
Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.
Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind.
Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths.
Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired.” (Annals, XV, 44)
 Nero illuminated his garden parties with Christians whom he burnt alive.
Surely someone would have confessed the truth under the threat of such terrible pain.
The fact is, however, we have no record of any early Christian denouncing the faith to end his suffering.
Instead, we have multiple accounts of post-resurrection appearances and hundreds of eyewitnesses willing to suffer and die for it.
 Finally, a fifth line of evidence concerns a peculiarity of the eyewitness testimony.
Some have suggested that Christ faked His death and later escaped from the tomb.
This is patently absurd.
According to the eyewitness testimony, Christ was beaten, tortured, lacerated, and stabbed.
He suffered internal damage, massive blood loss, asphyxiation, and a spear through His heart.
There is no good reason to believe that Jesus Christ (or any other man for that matter) could survive such an ordeal, fake His death, sit in a tomb for three days and nights without medical attention, food or water, remove the massive stone which sealed His tomb, escape undetected (without leaving behind a trail of blood), convince hundreds of eyewitnesses that He was resurrected from the death and in good health, and then disappear without a trace.
 Finally, a fifth line of evidence concerns a peculiarity of the eyewitness testimony.
In all of the major resurrection narratives, women are credited as the first and primary eyewitnesses.
This would be an odd invention since in both the ancient Jewish and Roman cultures women were severely disesteemed.
Their testimony was regarded as insubstantial and dismissible.
Given this fact, it is highly unlikely that any perpetrators of a hoax in 1st Century Judea would elect women to be their primary witnesses.
Of all the male disciples who claimed to see Jesus resurrected, if they all were lying and the resurrection was a scam, why did they pick the most ill-perceived, distrusted witnesses they could find?
Dr. William Lane Craig explains, “When you understand the role of women in first-century Jewish society, what’s really extraordinary is that this empty tomb story should feature women as the discoverers of the empty tomb in the first place.
Women were on a very low rung of the social ladder in first-century Israel.
Women’s testimony was regarded as so worthless that they weren’t even allowed to serve as legal witnesses in a Jewish court of Law.
 Finally, a fifth line of evidence concerns a peculiarity of the eyewitness testimony.
In light of this, it’s absolutely remarkable that the chief witnesses to the empty tomb are these women... Any later legendary account would have certainly portrayed male disciples as discovering the tomb - Peter or John, for example.
The fact that women are the first witnesses to the empty tomb is most plausibly explained by the reality that - like it or not - they were the discoverers of the empty tomb!
This shows that the Gospel writers faithfully recorded what happened, even if it was embarrassing.
This bespeaks the historicity of this tradition rather than its legendary status."
(Dr. William Lane Craig, quoted by Lee Strobel, The Case For Christ, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1998, p. 293)
 These lines of evidence: the demonstrable sincerity of the eyewitnesses (and in the Apostles’ case, compelling, inexplicable change), the conversion and demonstrable sincerity of key antagonists- and skeptics-turned-martyrs, the fact of the empty tomb, enemy attestation to the empty tomb, the fact that all of this took place in Jerusalem where faith in the resurrection began and thrived, the testimony of the women, the significance of such testimony given the historical context; all of these strongly attest to the historicity of the resurrection.
We encourage our readers to thoughtfully consider these evidences.
What do they suggest to you?
Having pondered them ourselves, we resolutely affirm Sir Lionel’s declaration:
 “The evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is so overwhelming that it compels acceptance by proof which leaves absolutely no room for doubt.”

 A dictionary definition of “religion” would be something similar to “belief in God or gods to be worshiped, usually expressed in conduct and ritual; any specific system of belief, worship, etc., often involving a code of ethics.” In light of this definition, the Bible does speak of organized religion, but in many cases the purpose and impact of “organized religion” are not something that God is pleased with.
In Genesis chapter 11, perhaps the first instance of organized religion, the descendants of Noah organized themselves to build the tower of Babel instead of obeying God’s command to fill the entire earth.
They believed that their unity was more important than their relationship with God.
God stepped in and confused their languages, thus breaking up this organized religion.
In Exodus chapter 6 and following, God “organized” a religion for the nation of Israel.
The Ten Commandments, the laws regarding the tabernacle, and the sacrificial system were all instituted by God and were to be followed by the Israelites.
Further study of the New Testament clarifies that the intent of this religion was to point to the need for a Savior-Messiah (Galatians 3; Romans 7).
They believed that their unity was more important than their relationship with God.
Throughout Israel’s history, many of the conflicts experienced by the Israelites involved conflict with organized religions.
Examples include the worship of Baal (Judges 6; 1 Kings 18), Dagon (1 Samuel 5), and Molech (2 Kings 23:10).
God defeated the followers of these religions, displaying His sovereignty and omnipotence.
In the Gospels, the Pharisees and Sadducees are depicted as the representatives of organized religion at the time of Christ.
Jesus constantly confronted them about their false teachings and hypocritical lifestyles.
Jesus constantly confronted them about their false teachings and hypocritical lifestyles.
In the Epistles, there were organized groups that mixed the gospel with certain lists of required works and rituals.
They also sought to put pressure on believers to change and accept these “Christianity plus” religions.
Galatians and Colossians give warnings about such religions.
In the book of Revelation, organized religion will have an impact on the world as the Antichrist sets up a one-world religion.
In many cases, the end result of organized religion is a distraction from the intent of God.
However, the Bible does speak of organized believers who are part of His plan.
God calls these groups of organized believers “churches.” The descriptions from the book of Acts and the Epistles indicate that the church is to be organized and interdependent.
In the book of Revelation, organized religion will have an impact on the world as the Antichrist sets up a one-world religion.
The organization leads to protection, productivity, and outreach (Acts 2:41-47).
In the case of the church, it could better be called an “organized relationship.” 
 Religion is man’s attempt to have communion with God.
The Christian faith is a relationship with God because of what He has done for us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
There is no plan to reach God (He has reached out to us—Romans 5:8).
There is no pride (all is received by grace—Ephesians 2:8-9).
There should be no conflict over leadership (Christ is the head—Colossians 1:18).
There should be no prejudice (we are all one in Christ—Galatians 3:28).
Being organized is not the problem.
Focusing on the rules and rituals of a religion is the problem.

 Our hearts go out to those who have thoughts of ending their own lives through suicide.
If that is you right now, it may speak of many emotions, such as feelings of hopelessness and despair.
You may feel like you are in the deepest pit, and you doubt there is any hope of things getting better.
No one seems to care or understand where you are coming from.
Life just is not worth living...or is it?
If you will take a few moments to consider letting God truly be God in your life right now, He will prove how big He really is, “for nothing is impossible with God” (Luke 1:37).
Perhaps scars from past hurts have resulted in an overwhelming sense of rejection or abandonment.
That may lead to self-pity, anger, bitterness, vengeful thoughts, or unhealthy fears that have caused problems in some of your most important relationships.
Why should you not commit suicide?
Friend, no matter how bad things are in your life, there is a God of love who is waiting for you to let Him guide you through your tunnel of despair and out into His marvelous light.
His name is Jesus.
This Jesus, the sinless Son of God, identifies with you in your time of rejection and humiliation.
The prophet Isaiah wrote of Him in Isaiah 53:2-6, describing Him as a man who was “despised and rejected” by everyone.
His life was full of sorrow and suffering.
He was pierced, wounded, and crushed, all because of our sin.
His life was full of sorrow and suffering.
Friend, Jesus Christ endured all this so that you might have all your sins forgiven.
Friend, no matter how bad things are in your life, there is a God of love who is waiting for you to let Him guide you through your tunnel of despair and out into His marvelous light.
“...Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you...” (Psalm 50:15).
Nothing you have ever done is too bad for Jesus to forgive.
Some of His choicest servants committed gross sins like murder (Moses), murder and adultery (King David), and physical and emotional abuse (the apostle Paul).
He promises to restore the joy you have lost and give you a new spirit to sustain you.
“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
Why should you not commit suicide?
Friend, God stands ready to repair what is “broken,” namely, the life you have now, the life you want to end by suicide.
In Isaiah 61:1-3, the prophet wrote, “The LORD has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor…to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve…to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.”
 Come to Jesus, and let Him restore your joy and usefulness as you trust Him to begin a new work in your life.
He promises to restore the joy you have lost and give you a new spirit to sustain you.
Your broken heart is precious to Him: “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise” (Psalm 51:12, 15-17).
Will you accept the Lord as your Savior and Shepherd?
He will guide your thoughts and steps—one day at a time—through His Word, the Bible.
In Isaiah 61:1-3, the prophet wrote, “The LORD has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.
“He will be the sure foundation for your times, a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is the key to this treasure” (Isaiah 33:6).
In Christ, you will still have struggles, but you will now have hope.
He is “a friend who sticks closer than a brother” (Proverbs 18:24).
May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you in your hour of decision.
If you desire to trust Jesus Christ as your Savior, speak these words in your heart to God: “God, I need you in my life.
Please forgive me for all that I have done.
I place my faith in Jesus Christ and believe that He is my Savior.
Thank You for Your love for me and for Jesus’ death on my behalf.”

 We should read and study the Bible because it is God’s Word to us.
The Bible is literally "God-breathed" (2 Timothy 3:16).
In other words, it is God’s very words to us.
There are so many questions that philosophers have asked that God answers for us in Scripture.
Where did I come from?
Is there life after death?
How do I get to heaven?
Why is the world full of evil?
Why do I struggle to do good?
In addition to these "big" questions, the Bible gives much practical advice in areas such as: What do I look for in a mate?
How can I be a good friend?
How can I have a successful marriage?
What is success and how do I achieve it?
How can I change?
What is the purpose to life?
How can I live so that I do not look back with regret?
How can I handle the unfair circumstances and bad events of life victoriously?
We should read and study the Bible because it is totally reliable and without error.
The Bible is unique among so-called "holy" books in that it does not merely give moral teaching and say, "Trust me."
How can I change?
Rather, we have the ability to test it by checking the hundreds of detailed prophecies that it makes, by checking the historical accounts it records, and by checking the scientific facts it relates.
Those who say the Bible has errors have their ears closed to the truth.
Jesus once asked which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven you," or "Rise, take up your bed and walk."
Similarly, we are given assurance that God’s Word is true when it discusses spiritual areas that we cannot test with our senses by showing itself true in those areas that we can test, such as historical accuracy, scientific accuracy, and prophetic accuracy.
Similarly, we are given assurance that God’s Word is true when it discusses spiritual areas that we cannot test with our senses by showing itself true in those areas that we can test, such as historical accuracy, scientific accuracy, and prophetic accuracy.
We should read and study the Bible because God does not change and because mankind’s nature does not change; it is as relevant for us as it was when it was written.
While technology changes, mankind’s nature and desires do not change.
We find, as we read the pages of biblical history, that whether we are talking about one-on-one relationships or societies, "there is nothing new under the sun" (Ecclesiastes 1:9).
And while mankind as a whole continues to seek love and satisfaction in all of the wrong places, God—our good and gracious Creator—tells us what will bring us lasting joy.
His revealed Word, the Bible, is so important that Jesus said of it, "Man does not live on bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).
In other words, if we want to live life to the fullest, as God intended, we must listen to and heed God’s written Word.
We should read and study the Bible because there is so much false teaching.
It tells us what God is like.
To have a wrong impression of God is to worship an idol or false god.
We are worshiping something that He is not.
Similarly, we are given assurance that God’s Word is true when it discusses spiritual areas that we cannot test with our senses by showing itself true in those areas that we can test, such as historical accuracy, scientific accuracy, and prophetic accuracy.
The Bible tells us how one truly gets to heaven, and it is not by being good or by being baptized or by anything else we do (John 14:6; Ephesians 2:1-10; Isaiah 53:6; Romans 3:10-18, 5:8, 6:23, 10:9-13).
Along this line, God’s Word shows us just how much God loves us (Romans 5:6-8; John 3:16).
And it is in learning this that we are drawn to love Him in return (1 John 4:19).
The Bible equips us to serve God (2 Timothy 3:17; Ephesians 6:17; Hebrews 4:12).
It helps us know how to be saved from our sin and its ultimate consequence (2 Timothy 3:15).
Meditating on God’s Word and obeying its teachings will bring success in life (Joshua 1:8; James 1:25).
Meditating on God’s Word and obeying its teachings will bring success in life (Joshua 1:8; James 1:25).
God’s Word helps us see sin in our lives and helps us get rid of it (Psalm 119:9, 11).
It gives us guidance in life, making us wiser than our teachers (Psalm 32:8, 119:99; Proverbs 1:6).
It is a book for studying so that it can be applied.
Reading and studying the Bible helps us see beyond the attractive "bait" to the painful "hook" in sinful temptations, so that we can learn from others' mistakes rather than making them ourselves.
Experience is a great teacher, but when it comes to learning from sin, it is a terribly hard teacher.
It is so much better to learn from others' mistakes.
For example, David, in his defeat of Goliath, teaches us that God is greater than anything He asks us to face (1 Samuel 17), while his giving in to the temptation to commit adultery with Bathsheba reveals just how long-lasting and terrible the consequences of a moment’s sinful pleasure can be (2 Samuel 11).
God’s Word helps us see sin in our lives and helps us get rid of it (Psalm 119:9, 11).
The Bible is a book that is not merely for reading.
It is a book for studying so that it can be applied.
Otherwise, it is like swallowing food without chewing and then spitting it back out again—no nutritional value is gained by it.
The Bible is God’s Word.
As such, it is as binding as the laws of nature.
We can ignore it, but we do so to our own detriment, just as we would if we ignored the law of gravity.
It is a book for studying so that it can be applied.

 Many people say that the first thing they want to do when they arrive in heaven is see all their friends and loved ones who have passed on before them.
In eternity, there will be plenty of time to see, know, and spend time with our friends and family members.
However, that will not be our primary focus in heaven.
Our reunions with loved ones are more likely to be filled with recounting the grace and glory of God in our lives, His wondrous love, and His mighty works.
Our reunions with loved ones are more likely to be filled with recounting the grace and glory of God in our lives, His wondrous love, and His mighty works.
We will rejoice all the more because we can praise and worship the Lord in the company of other believers, especially those we loved on earth.

King Saul recognized Samuel when the witch of Endor summoned Samuel from the realm of the dead (1 Samuel 28:8-17).
The Bible declares that when we arrive in heaven, we will “be like him [Jesus]; for we shall see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).
David assumed that he would be able to recognize his son in heaven, despite the fact that he died as a baby.
In Luke 16:19-31, Abraham, Lazarus, and the rich man were all recognizable after death.
At the transfiguration, Moses and Elijah were recognizable (Matthew 17:3-4).
In these examples, the Bible does seem to indicate that we will be recognizable after death.
The Bible declares that when we arrive in heaven, we will “be like him [Jesus]; for we shall see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).
Just as our earthly bodies were of the first man Adam, so will our resurrection bodies be just like Christ’s (1 Corinthians 15:47).
In these examples, the Bible does seem to indicate that we will be recognizable after death.
For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality” (1 Corinthians 15:49, 53).
Many people recognized Jesus after His resurrection (John 20:16, 20; 21:12; 1 Corinthians 15:4-7).
If Jesus was recognizable in His glorified body, we also will be recognizable in our glorified bodies.
Being able to see our loved ones is a glorious aspect of heaven, but heaven is far more about God, and far less about us.
What a pleasure it will be to be reunited with our loved ones and worship God with them for all eternity.
