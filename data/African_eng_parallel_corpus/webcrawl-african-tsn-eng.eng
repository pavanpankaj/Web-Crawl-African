3. Destruction of public property

4. Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) Report
4.1. Cabinet is concerned about the audit outcomes of municipalities released by the AGSA recently. The unacceptably high levels of poor governance, particularly the management of public funds in a number of municipalities, suggest ineffective and poor execution of service-delivery programmes.
4.2. The Public Audit Amendment Act, 2018 (Act 5 of 2018), gives the AGSA the authority to hold those found responsible for poor financial management accountable and to curb the abuse of state resources, especially in municipalities which have consistently shown no improvement in their respective outcomes.
4.3. Additionally, working through the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, and National Treasury, Cabinet endorses the Back to Basics implementation plan which drives capacity-building in municipalities. The plan, amongst others, seeks to build the competency of personnel through training and skills transfer, and the enforcement of minimum compliance standards for municipal managers and senior officials.
4.4. Working with the provincial leadership, Minister Dlamini Zuma will continue to provide the necessary support to municipalities.
5. Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)
5.1. Cabinet is pleased that South Africa has successfully hosted its first Digital Economy Summit, held in Johannesburg on 5 July 2019, as a critical milestone in shaping a coherent 4IR plan for the country. President Ramaphosa, future forecaster George Friedman, labour, academia and civil society attended the summit, which stimulated dialogue, understanding and action plans that will position South Africa as a competitive global player.
5.2. Cabinet also welcomes the plans by Google to build a new undersea cable from Portugal to South Africa that will deliver 20 times more network capacity, ensuring faster Internet service. The cable is expected to be completed in 2021. Such interventions will contribute towards making South Africa conducive to potential domestic and international investors.

10. Gauteng freeway electronic tolling (e-tolling)
10.2. The consultations within government over the coming weeks are expected to produce workable outcomes, which will be submitted to Cabinet by the end of August 2019.
10.3. A united response across government is required on issues such as e-tolling to ensure South Africans have confidence in the work of government.
11. Budget votes
11.1. During July 2019, departments are tabling their budget votes, which provide concrete financial plans on the commitments highlighted by President Ramaphosa in his first State of the Nation Address of the sixth democratic administration.
11.2. The budget votes provide a detailed account of departments’ respective plans for the year, which give effect to the 2019-2024 Medium Term Strategic Framework.
11.3. Cabinet encourages citizens to engage with the budget votes and hold departments to account. Budget votes ensure that public funds are spent according to government’s priorities and in ways that will most benefit South Africans.

16.1. Cabinet approved the publication of the policy for public comment. The policy provides for a credible and transparent process for land allocation and beneficiary selection.
16.2. Notably, it addresses the gender inequity in land allocation and access, and a lack of mechanisms to enable poor communal residents and villagers to access land in case of natural disasters and other emergency situations.
C. Bills
18. Cabinet also approved the Social Services Practitioners Bill of 2019 to be gazetted for public comment. The Bill was developed to expand the regulation of social service practitioners by recognising that there are both professional and auxiliary levels within the social service occupations. This Bill once it is legislated, will repeal the current Social Service Professional Act, 1978 (Act 110 of 1978). The Department of Social Development will at a later stage unpack the two proposed bills.
21. Cabinet approved the publication of the Municipal Fiscal Powers and Functions Amendment Bill for public comment. The Bill amends the Municipal Fiscal Powers and Functions Act, 2007 (Act 12 of 2007). It regulates the powers of municipalities to levy development charges in respect of land development applications submitted to the municipality.
Development charges are one of the instruments that municipalities can use to finance the development of municipal infrastructure. This enables municipalities to execute their role of providing well-maintained and functioning infrastructure services to unlock economic growth.
22. Cabinet approved the submission to Parliament the Auditing Profession Amendment Bill. The Bill amends the Auditing Profession Act, 2005 (Act 26 of 2005). The Bill proposes that the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors be empowered to subpoena any person with any information required to complete an investigation on improper conduct by auditors. The amendments also empower the Minister of Finance to determine the maximum amount which can be imposed on an auditor with a guilty finding following a disciplinary hearing.

Fellow South Africans,
It is 30 years since Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela walked out of the gates of Victor Verster Prison, a moment in our history that signalled perhaps more vividly than any other that freedom was at hand.
As he stood on the balcony of Cape Town City Hall to address the masses who had come in their tens of thousands to welcome him, he said:
‘Our march to freedom is irreversible. We must not allow fear to stand in our way.’
Now, 30 years later, as we continue our onward march to improve the lives of our people, as we confront great challenges, as we endure troubled times, we too cannot allow fear to stand in our way.
We must forge ahead, permitting neither adversity nor doubt to divert us.
As we gather to reflect on the state of our nation, we are joined by the family of Basil February, a courageous young freedom fighter who lost his life in Zimbabwe in the Wankie campaign of 1967.
For half a century his resting place, like those of several of his comrades, has, until now, remained unknown.
His contribution, his sacrifice, has never been forgotten.
This evening, we gather here humbled by the memories of those men and women who gave their lives for our freedom, deeply aware of the great responsibility we carry to
realise their dreams.
There are times when we have fallen short, there are times when we have made mistakes, but we remain unwavering in our determination to build a society that is free and equal and at peace.
Our history tells us that when we are united in peace and faith, we can conquer all obstacles and turn our country into a place in which we all feel safe and comfortable.
It is in that spirit that we now approach the present moment.
Our country is facing a stark reality.
Our economy has not grown at any meaningful rate for over a decade.
Even as jobs are being created, the rate of unemployment is deepening.
The recovery of our economy has stalled as persistent energy shortages have disrupted businesses and people’s lives.
Several state owned enterprises are in distress, and our public finances are under severe pressure.
It is you, the people of South Africa, who carry this burden, confronted by rising living costs, unable to escape poverty, unable to realise your potential.
Yet, at the same time, there is another part to our reality.
It is the reality of a youthful population that has more access to education than ever before and which is achieving steadily improving outcomes.
It is the reality of 2.4 million children in early childhood development and pre-school.
It is about the 81% of learners who passed matric last year, with an increasing proportion coming from rural and township schools.
For this great achievement, we applaud the Class of 2019.
Our reality is also that of the 720,000 students who received state funding for TVET colleges and universities last year.
It is about the 6.8 million South Africans who know their HIV status, about the 5 million people who have been initiated on antiretroviral treatment and the 4.2 million people whose HIV viral load is, as a consequence, undetectable.
These are not just statistics.
These are lives being improved.
They are signs of progress.
Our reality is also one of unbounded potential.
Of a soil that is rich in minerals and in a diversity of plant and animal life that has few equals in the world.
Of a deep capital base, extensive infrastructure, sound laws and robust institutions.
We also welcome Springbok captain Siya Kolisi, who led a group of determined and united South Africans to become the 2019 World Rugby Champions.
We are joined this evening by another remarkable young person, Miss Sinoyolo Qumba, a Grade 11 learner from Lenasia South, who spent much of yesterday helping me to write this State of the Nation Address.
Her intellect, her social awareness, her passion and her diligence give me great confidence in the future of this country.
In my first two addresses to the nation I spoke at length about the necessity of social compacting, and the great responsibility we shoulder as government to drive collaboration and consensus.
In 1994 we chose the path of negotiation, compromise and peaceful settlement, instead of hatred and revenge.
The greatest strength of our constitutional democracy, and the reason it has endured, is because we have been able to forge broad-based coalitions and social compacts, be they with business, labour, special interest groups or wider civil society.
Achieving consensus and building social compacts is a not demonstration of weakness. It is the very essence of who we are.
In his inaugural address on the 10th of May 1994, President Nelson Mandela said:
“Today we enter into a covenant that we shall build a society in which all South Africans, both black and white, will be able to walk tall, without fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to human dignity.”
Even if we were to marshal every single resource at our disposal, and engage on a huge expenditure of public funds, we would not alone be able to guarantee employment to the millions of people who are out of work.
What we have achieved, we have achieved together.
Over the course of the last two years – since I first stood here to deliver a State of the Nation Address – we have worked to forge compacts among South Africans to answer the many challenges before us.
Through the Jobs Summit, we brought labour, business, government and communities together to find solutions to the unemployment crisis, and we continue to meet at the beginning of every month to remove blockages and drive interventions that will save and create jobs.
We have come together, as government and civil society, as communities and faith-based groupings, to confront the violence that is perpetrated by men against women.
We have brought business, labour and government together to craft master plans for those industries that have the greatest potential for growth.
We have come together as different spheres of government, as different state entities, as business associations and community groups under a new district development model that is fundamentally changing our approach to local development.
We have been building social compacts because it is through partnership and cooperation that we progress.
Together, over these last two years, we have worked to stabilise our economy and build a foundation for growth.
We have been deliberate in rebuilding institutions and removing impediments to investment.
We have acted decisively against state capture and fought back against corruption.
We have steadily improved the reach of education, improved the quality of health care and tended to the basic needs of the poor.
Yet, that has not been enough.
It has not been enough to free our economy from the grim inheritance of our past, nor from the mistakes that we ourselves have made.
It has not been enough to spare us from the debilitating effects of load-shedding, nor from an unstable and subdued global economy.
And so we find ourselves today at a decisive moment.
We have a choice.
We can succumb to the many and difficult and protracted problems that confront us, or we can confront them, with resolve and determination and with action.
Because we choose to confront our challenges, our immediate, vital and overarching task is to place our economy on a path of inclusive growth.
Without growth there will be no jobs, and without jobs there will be no meaningful improvement in the lives of our people.
This State of the Nation Address is therefore about inclusive growth.
It is about the critical actions we take this year to build a capable state and place our economy on the path to recovery.
This year, we fix the fundamentals.
We pursue critical areas of growth.
And we ensure excellence in planning and execution in government.
Fellow South Africans,
For over a decade, South Africans have had to contend with the effects of a constrained energy supply.
I have spoken extensively about the critical role that Eskom plays in the economy of our country and in the livelihood of every South African.
The load shedding of the last few months has had a debilitating effect on our country.
It has severely set back our efforts to rebuild the economy and to create jobs.
Every time it occurs, it disrupts people’s lives, causing frustration, inconvenience, hardship.
At its core, load-shedding is the inevitable consequence of Eskom’s inability over many years – due to debt, lack of capacity and state capture – to service its power plants.
The reality that we will need to accept is that in order for Eskom to undertake the fundamental maintenance necessary to improve the reliability of supply, load-shedding will remain a possibility for the immediate future.
Over the next few months, as Eskom works to restore its operational capabilities, we will be implementing measures that will fundamentally change the trajectory of energy generation in our country.
We are taking the following measures to rapidly and significantly increase generation capacity outside of Eskom:
The social partners organised under Nedlac have been meeting over the last two weeks to agree on the principles of a social compact on electricity.
This is a historic and unprecedented development since it demonstrates the commitment of all social partners to take the necessary actions and make the necessary sacrifices to secure our energy needs.
Through this compact the social partners seek an efficient, productive and fit-for-purpose Eskom that generates electricity at affordable prices for communities and industries.
This requires both a drastic reduction in costs – including a review of irregular contracts – and measures to mobilise resources that will reduce Eskom’s debt and inject fresh capital where needed.
The social partners – trade unions, business, community and government – are committed to mobilising funding to address Eskom’s financial crisis in a financially sustainable manner.
They would like to do this in a manner that does not put workers pensions at risk and that does not compromise the integrity of the financial system.
While they work to finalise this agreement, the reality is that our energy system will remain constrained until new energy generation comes on stream.
Through these immediate measures and the work underway to fundamentally restructure our electricity industry, we will achieve a secure supply of reliable, affordable and, ultimately, sustainable energy.
We undertake this decisive shift in our energy trajectory at a time when humankind faces its greatest existential threat in the form of climate change.
Yesterday I met Ayakha Melithafa, a young climate activist from Eerste Rivier who attended the World Economic Forum in Davos this year to call on world leaders to stand firmly for climate justice.
Ayakha asked me to make sure no African child is left behind in the transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient and sustainable society; and it is a promise I intend to keep.
The Presidential Commission on Climate Change will ensure that as we move towards a low carbon growth trajectory that we leave no one behind.
We will finalise the Climate Change Bill, which provides a regulatory framework for the effective management of inevitable climate change impacts by enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change – and identifying new industrial opportunities in the green economy.
Honourable Members,
We need to fix our public finances.
Low levels of growth mean that we are not generating enough revenue to meet our expenses, our debt is heading towards unsustainable levels, and spending is misdirected towards consumption and debt-servicing rather than infrastructure and productive activity.
We cannot continue along this path. Nor can we afford to stand still.
We are engaged with labour and other stakeholders on measures to contain the public wage bill and reduce wastage.
By working with the Auditor-General to reduce irregular expenditure, by shifting government spending from consumption expenditure to investment in infrastructure, we aim to improve the state of public finances.
We have decided to establish a sovereign wealth fund as a means to preserve and grow the national endowment of our nation, giving practical meaning to the injunction that the people shall share in the country’s wealth.
We are also proceeding with the establishment of a state bank as part of our effort to extend access to financial services to all South Africans.
The Minister of Finance will provide details on these in his Budget Speech.
We will be undertaking far-reaching economic reform measures that we will include those contained in the paper produced by National Treasury, entitled ‘Economic Transformation, Inclusive Growth and Competitiveness’.
This year, we are moving from the stabilisation of state-owned enterprises to repurposing these strategic companies to support growth and development.
After years of state capture, corruption and mismanagement, we are working to ensure that all SOEs are able to fulfil their developmental mandate and be financially sustainable.
In consultation with the Presidential SOE Council, we will undertake a process of rationalisation of our state owned enterprises and ensure that they serve strategic economic or developmental purposes.
The extent of capture, corruption and mismanagement in SOEs is best demonstrated at South Africans Airways, which was placed in business rescue late last year.
The business rescue practioners are expected to unveil their plans for restructuring the airline in the next few weeks.
In the interests of South Africa’s aviation industry and our economy, it is essential that a future restructured airline is commercially and operationally sustainable and is not dependent on further government funding.
Our rail network daily transports over a million commuters to and from work.
As we work to fix the capabilities of the state, we know that growth and job creation will in large measure be driven by private enterprise.
We are therefore building an operating environment that is favourable to doing business.
Water use licences, which are so essential to operations on farms, factories and mines, have previously taken an inordinately long time to process, sometimes up to 5 years.
We are able to announce that water use licences are now issued within 90 days.
Our ports are congested and inefficient.
During the course of this year, we will undertake a fundamental overhaul of the Durban port – the third largest container terminal in the Southern Hemisphere – to reduce delays and costs.
The most significant contribution we can make to inclusive economic growth is in the development of appropriate skills and capabilities.
The investments we make now in early childhood development and early school learning will yield great economic benefits in the next two decades – and beyond.
But there are immediate interventions that we are making to improve the quality and the relevance of our educational outcomes.
We are making progress with the introduction of the three-stream curriculum model, heralding a fundamental shift in focus towards more vocational and technical education.
Various technical vocational specialisations have already been introduced in 550 schools and 67 schools are now piloting the occupational stream.
We are building nine new TVET college campuses this year, in Sterkspruit, Aliwal North, Graaff Reinet and Ngungqushe in the Eastern Cape, and in Umzimkhulu, Greytown, Msinga, Nongoma and Kwagqikazi in KwaZulu-Natal.
Through bilateral student scholarship agreements we have signed with other countries, we are steadily building a substantial cohort of young people who go overseas each year for training in critical skills.
This programme is a living monument to these two great revolutionaries.
Last year I spoke about our plan to issue tablet computers to school students.
We said that every 10-year-old needs to be able to read for meaning.
Our early reading programmes are gathering momentum.
This year, we will be introducing coding and robotics in grades R to 3 in 200 schools, with a plan to implement it fully by 2022.
This will enable young people in that metro to be trained in high-impact and cutting-edge technological innovation for current and future industries.
Investment and growth require a safe, stable and crime-free environment.
More importantly, it is fundamental to the aspirations of all our people to live in security, peace and comfort.
Police visibility, effective training and better resourcing of police stations are our priorities.
I have prioritised our response to the growing problem of criminal groups that extort money from construction and other businesses.
To support the growth of the tourism industry, the SAPS will increase visibility at identified tourist attraction sites.
It is training Tourism Safety Monitors and will establish a reserve police capacity to focus on the policing of tourist attraction areas.
Anti-Gang Units will be further strengthened, with priority given to the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Gauteng and Free State.
Following the graduation of 5,000 police trainees last year, 7,000 new police trainees have been enlisted this year to strengthen local policing.
To improve the quality of general and specialised SAPS investigations, we are establishing a Crime Detection University in Hammanskraal.
Fellow South Africans,
Through building social compacts across society to fight this scourge we will be able to achieve much more.
But it is only the beginning of the struggle.
We implemented an emergency action plan and reprioritised R1.6 billion to support this plan until the end of the current financial year.
There has been progress in several areas.
We will amend the Domestic Violence Act to better protect victims in violent domestic relationships and the Sexual Offences Act to broaden the categories of sex offenders whose names must be included in the National Register for Sex Offenders, and we will pass a law to tighten bail and sentencing condition in cases that involve gender-based violence.
We will not let up in the fight against corruption and state capture.
We should upgrade our culture of reporting crime when we see it being committed.
This battle can only succeed if it is taken on by the whole of society, if we build a formidable social compact of all formations.
We therefore welcome the work of the joint government and civil society working group charged with developing a national anti-corruption strategy and implementation plan, which is close to completion of this phase of its work.
We plan to launch the strategy by mid-year.
The Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture continues with its critical work with the full support of government and other institutions.
I will make it available to the public together with a plan on taking the findings and recommendations forward in a few days.
Fellow South Africans,
As we fix the fundamentals, as we deepen the reforms we have made, we pursue critical areas of inclusive growth.
The team has a project pipeline with potential investments of over R700 billion over the next 10 years, including both government and non-government contributions.
The cranes and yellow equipment that we have longed to see across the landscape of our country will once again soon be an everyday sight.
The social housing programme to build rental housing for low-income families is at implementation stage, which could leverage as much as R9 billion of private investment in the construction of 37 000 rental apartments.
These building projects are ready to start.
We have been speaking about the Umzimvubu Dam in the Eastern Cape for almost a decade, with little to show on the ground.
We are determined to overcome the financial and other challenges that have held back progress and denied the people of this areas such a vital resource.
Road construction on the site has commenced, and I will soon be visiting the site to ensure that we take this work forward.
It will not only be smart and 5G ready, but will be a leading benchmark for green infrastructure continental and internationally.
This initiative will ensure cost effective solutions for the State, meaningful skills transfer and higher potential for labour intensive job creation than conventional roads construction methods.
Fellow South Africans,
More than half of all young people are unemployed.We need to make this country work for young people, so that they can work for our country.
The solution to this crisis must be two-pronged - we must all create opportunities for youth employment and self-employment.
On youth employment, as from today, we begin the implementation of the Presidential Youth Employment Intervention – six priority actions over the next five years to reduce youth unemployment.
This will allow them to receive active support, information and work readiness training to increase their employability and match themselves to opportunities.
Second, we are fundamentally changing how we prepare young people for the future of work, providing shorter, more flexible courses in specific skills that employers in fast-growing sectors need.
Third, we are developing new and innovative ways to support youth entrepreneurship and self-employment.
Fourth, we are scaling up the Youth Employment Service and working with TVET colleges and the private sector to ensure that more learners receive practical experience in the workplace to complete their training.
Fifthly, we are establishing the first cohort of a Presidential Youth Service programme that will unlock the agency of young people and provide opportunities for them to earn an income while contributing to nation building.
This will be through top slicing from the budget, which will require that we all tighten our belts and redirect resources to address the national crisis of youth unemployment.
The Minister of Finance will prioritise this initiative and give specific details when he delivers the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement later this year.
These six actions will together ensure that every young person in this country has a place to go, that their energy and capabilities are harnessed, and that they can contribute to the growth of their communities and their country.
We are introducing the SheTradesZA platform to assist women-owned businesses to participate in global value chains and markets.
Over the next five years, the Industrial Development Corporation is targeting R10 billion of own and partner funding for women empowered businesses.
To create a larger market for small businesses, we plan to designate 1,000 locally produced products that must be procured from SMMEs.
This year, we intensify our investment drive with the establishment of an integrated investment promotion and facilitation capability coordinated from the Presidency.
We will hold our third South Africa Investment Conference in November to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.
At the second South Africa Investment Conference last year, over 70 companies made investment commitments of R364 billion in industries as diverse as advanced manufacturing, agro-processing, infrastructure, mining, services, tourism and hospitality.
In the first two years of our ambitious investment drive, we have raised a total of R664 billion in investment commitments, which is more than half of our five-year target of R1.2 trillion.
More importantly, these investments are having a real impact.
Already, projects with an investment value of R9 billion have been completed and 27 projects worth just over R250 billion are in implementation phase, with more coming on-stream this year.
We have been to the opening of facilities producing goods ranging from power cables to sanitary products, from tyres to food.
These master plans bring government, labour and business together to develop practical measures to spur growth at sector level and each partner contributes to making it work.
The Clothing and Textiles Master Plan, which was signed last year, aims to create 121,000 new jobs in the retail-clothing textile and footwear sector over the decade.
This suit that I am wearing today, like last year, was proudly made by South African workers.
The industry is now focused on growth, greater production and more investment.
This will help even the playing field for small businesses and emerging entrepreneurs.
Market inquiries into data services, the grocery retail market and health care have provided the basis for measures to reduce costs to consumers and make these sectors more competitive.
This is an important step to improve lives, bring people into the digital economy and stimulate online businesses.
The digital economy will increasingly become a driver of growth and a creator of employment.
The Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution has made far-reaching recommendations that impact on nearly every aspect of the economy and in many areas of our lives.
The Commission’s report provides us with the tools to ensure that we extract the greatest benefit of these revolutionary technological changes.
An important condition for the success of our digital economy is the availability of high demand spectrum to expand broadband access and reliability.
Because of additional requirements, the licensing of the wireless open access network – or WOAN – is likely to completed during the course of next year.
Agriculture is one of the industries with the greatest potential for growth.
To date, we have released 44,000 hectares of state land for the settlement of land restitution claims, and will this year release round 700,000 hectares of state land for agricultural production.
A new beneficiary selection policy includes compulsory training for potential beneficiaries before land can be allocated to them.
Because of the drought in many parts of the country, farmers lost crops and livestock and many workers have lost their livelihoods.
Working with the Agricultural Research Council and other scientific and agricultural bodies, we have developed drought mitigation strategies that focus on developing drought resistant seeds, planting and storing fodder, removing of invasive plantsand management strategies to prevent soil degradation.
The regulatory steps will soon be announced by the relevant ministers.
A fundamental condition for growth and development is a healthy and productive population, with access to quality, affordable health care.
In preparation for NHI, we have already registered more than 44 million people at over 3,000 clinics in the electronic Health Patient Registration System, and are now implementing this system in hospitals.
I have established the Presidential Working Group on Disability to advise my office on measures to advance the empowerment of persons with disabilities as government plans, budgets and implements programmes.
Following the recognition by the Department of Basic Education in 2018 of South African Sign Language as a home language and the recommendation by the Parliamentary Constitutional Review Committee that it be the 12th official language, we are now poised to finalise the matter.
Fellow South Africans,
Earlier this week, I returned from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, where South Africa assumed the chairship of the African Union for 2020.
We take up this responsibility at an important time for our continent.
This year, the African Continental Free Trade Area will come into effect.
Allow me to take this opportunity to congratulate our compatriot, Mr Wamkele Mene, who was this past weekend elected as the first Secretary-General of the African Continental Free Trade Area, and assure him of our full support as he assumes this historic and challenging responsibility.
South Africa has therefore prioritised the economic empowerment of Africa’s women during its term as AU chair, working with all member states on measures to promote financial inclusion, preferential procurement and preferential trade arrangements for women.
The AU Heads of State have pledged their support for measures to end gender-based violence on the continent, and will work towards the adoption of an AU Convention on Violence against Women during the course of this year.
Through the African Peer Review Mechanism, South Africa will work with other countries to advance good governance and democracy.
We will use all the means at our disposal – including our membership of the UN Security Council – to promote peace and security on the continent.
Honourable Members,Fellow South Africans,
Everything we do must be underpinned by effective implementation.
It builds the capability of the state where it has been most broken.
Provincial and national government will re-double their support and strengthen the capacity of municipalities as required by Section 154 of the Constitution and provide for the monitoring and support of municipalities.
Currently there are 40 municipalities in the country subjected to such intervention.
The measures that will be taken will complement the objectives of the new district-based model of development, that seeks to take an integrated approach to` service delivery
Residents of the Mamusa Municipality in North West have already seen this approach in action, where the District Development Model was effectively utilised to clear illegal dumping sites, refurbish pump stations to stop sewage spilling in the streets, build roads and lay water pipes, and provide water and toilets to local schools.
This year, we plan to expand the district development model to 23 new districts, drawing on lessons from the three pilot districts – OR Tambo District Municipality, Ethekwini and Waterberg District Municipality.
To strengthen the capacity of the state and increase accountability, I will be signing performance agreements with all Ministers before the end of this month.
These agreements – which are based on the targets contained in the Medium-Term Strategic Framework – will be made public so that the people of South Africa can hold those who they elected into office to account.
We see these performance agreements as the cornerstone of a new culture of transparency and accountability, where those who are given the responsibility to serve – whether as elected office bearers or public servants – do what is expected of them.
It is a culture where corruption, nepotism and patronage are not tolerated, and action is taken against those who abuse their power or steal public money.
Fellow South Africans,
We find ourselves at a decisive moment in our history.
It is a time of great difficulty and doubt, but also a time laden with great opportunities.
Over the last two years, we have worked together to build a foundation for progress.
Now is the time for us to build on that foundation, to unite, to work, to perservere.
We will continue our onward march to freedom.
We will embrace change.
We will cherish life.
We will fear nothing.
As we do so, we will recall the inspired lyrics of one of South Africa’s most treasured musicians, uBab Joseph Shabalala, the founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whose passing we mourn this week.
Written in a different era, his words still ring true:
I thank you.
A virtual Special Cabinet Meeting was held today, 15 April 2020, to discuss the socio-economic recovery plan post the COVID-19 National Lockdown.
This follows the announcement made by President Cyril Ramaphosa two weeks ago, that the Cabinet would have a full discussion to come up with an economic recovery plan for the country.
Five presentations were received from the clusters: (1) Economic Sectors, Investment, Employment and Infrastructure Development; (2) Governance, State Capacity and Institutional Development; (3) Social Protection, Community and Human Development; (4) International Cooperation, Trade and Security; and (5) Justice, Crime Prevention and Security.
All the Cabinet clusters have been asked to work together to produce one consolidated document on key priorities of the country’s economic recovery plan, to be completed before the next Cabinet Meeting scheduled to take place on Monday, 20 April 2020.
Cabinet has also directed Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to prepare an updated report on the South African Airways, for discussion at the upcoming meeting. Thereafter, Cabinet will finalise the country’s economic recovery plan.
Cabinet thanks all people across the country for staying at home during the lockdown period.

1.2. Accompanied by various Ministers, he met with community, labour and business sectors, South African Council of Churches; leadership of interfaith communities; Mayors; Premiers; South African Local Government Association, traditional leadership and political parties represented in Parliament.
1.5. Cabinet reiterated its support for the inclusive consultations undertaken by President Ramaphosa since the start of the national state of disaster on 15 March 2020. These consultations have made it possible for all sectors of society to play a role in the fight against the Covid19 pandemic, saving of lives and protecting livelihoods.
1.7. The COVID-19 NATJOINTS is built on work streams that comprise scientists; health specialists; engineers; representatives of the National Disaster Management centres; legal advisors; leadership of the country’s security and law-enforcement agencies, and teams from departments that make up the economic and social clusters of the Forum of South African Directors-General.
1.8. NATJOINTS receives reports from different departments and submits proposals to Directors-General (DGs) to develop recommendations that are presented to the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC).
1.9. The NCCC deliberates DGs’ recommendations and also makes its own recommendations to Cabinet where proposals, including regulations, are approved. This process ensures that the Executive takes collective decisions that are consensual and inclusive. Therefore, Cabinet condemns in the strongest possible terms false suggestions that individual members of the Executive are responsible for recommendations that emanate from the NCCC or decisions taken by Cabinet.
1.10. Cabinet appeals for the unity in action by all sectors of society against a common and dangerous enemy, the COVID-19 pandemic.
1.12. The drastic containment measures resulted in significantly slowing and reduction of the infectious trajectory. The lockdown gave South Africa the time and space to put measures in place in the public and private health sectors to deal with an inevitable increase in infections.
1.13. Cabinet continues to appeal to all South Africans to take greater personal responsibility to protect themselves and others to reduce the spread of the virus.
Cabinet Decisions

3.3. In general, it also seeks to align it with other legislations passed post 1994 and which relate to local government. A wide consultation with all the relevant stakeholders and general public has been undertaken.
4.1. Cabinet approved that under Level 3, which starts from Monday, 1 June 2020, it would adopt a blended approach which includes both physical and virtual Cabinet meetings.
4.2 Cabinet also approved the monitoring teams comprising Ministers and Deputy Ministers. They have been allocated to each of the 52 districts and metros to monitor the measures that have been put in place to combat the spread of COVID-19.

Statement on the Virtual Cabinet Meeting held on Thursday, 4 June 2020
1. North High Court Judgment of Tuesday, 2 June 2020
1.2. After obtaining legal advice and listening to numerous comments made by members of the legal fraternity in reaction to the judgement, we are of the view that another court might come to a different conclusion on the matter.
1.3. Cabinet has therefore decided to appeal the North Gauteng High court decision.
1.4. Government will ask that its appeal be heard on an urgent basis so that it can obtain certainty on the regulations. The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma will be joined in this appeal by President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize.
1.5. Cabinet wishes to assure the nation that all interventions introduced since the declaration of a state of national disaster in March 2020 by President Cyril Ramaphosa have been directed primarily at saving lives.
1.6. In implementing these interventions, government has consistently consulted all sectors of society, as the fight against COVID-19 is a national effort that requires unity in action between Government and all South Africans.
1.7. While government appeals the court judgment, current regulations remain in force and we appeal and urge all our people to observe all the health protocols that have been put in place including washing of hands, social distancing, wearing of masks in public as well as screening and referral for testing where necessary.

1. South African Airways (SAA) Business Rescue Plan
1.1. Cabinet received a progress report on the SAA business rescue process from the IMC on the SAA, chaired by the Public Enterprises Minister Mr Pravin Gordhan.
5.4. These projects will be funded mainly from either of the three streams –commercial, blended financing and fiscal allocations. As part of the economic recovery package, the country’s spirit of public-private collaboration continues to focus on addressing spatial disparities, transforming the economy and creating much-needed jobs.
5.3. Eighty-eight of these projects are investment-ready and include industries with proven superior multiplier effects in energy; water; transport; information and communication technology infrastructure; human settlements; agriculture and agro processing.
4.2. Cabinet is unwavering in its commitment to fully implement a range of interventions developed from the National Strategic Plan on GBV and Femicide. The Inter-Ministerial Committee chaired by Minister in The Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Ms Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, continues to drive the multidisciplinary government interventions. However, the most effective intervention requires all South Africans to play their part in ending the culture of violence against the most vulnerable members of society.
2.2. Cabinet is optimistic that the commitments announced by Minister Mboweni will put our economy firmly on a solid and sustainable path, particularly if everyone joins government in implementing them.
2. Economy

3.3. Cabinet reiterates the call to all of us to work together to stop the spread of infections within our communities by observing the health protocols such as regularly washing hands, social distancing and wearing a mask when in public.
5.4. These projects will be funded mainly from either of the three streams –commercial, blended financing and fiscal allocations. As part of the economic recovery package, the country’s spirit of public-private collaboration continues to focus on addressing spatial disparities, transforming the economy and creating much-needed jobs.

A. Issues in the environment
2. Gender-based violence (GBV)
2.1. The scourge of GBV continues to plague our nation with the senseless violent assault and murder of women. The recent victims of this heinous crime include actress Thandeka Mdeliswa (34) who was shot at her family home in Evander, Mpumalanga and the 28-year-old woman who was killed by her husband while reporting a domestic violence at the Madeira Police Station in the Eastern Cape. Cabinet calls for justice to be served on these crimes and others that are reported.
3.1. Cabinet has noted with great concern an extremely disturbing advertisement published on the Clicks website, which justifiably triggered widespread public outrage. Cabinet considers the advertisement profoundly offensive and racist.
3.5. All sectors of our society must endorse partnerships between government departments and Chapter Nine institutions in implementing anti-racism and anti-discrimination educational campaigns.
3.7. South Africa is working towards growing the economy and cannot afford to risk the loss of jobs due to business closures. Lawlessness and vandalism of private and public property should not be condoned as they are not a responsible and progressive option to resolve a conflict.
4. Economy
4.2. This affirms the correctness of government’s decision to urgently embark on an economic recovery plan, working together with all our social partners to get the economy on a better growth trajectory.
4.3. The plan, which will be infrastructure led, will also include implementation of much-needed structural reforms.
5. Death of Nathaniel Julius
5.3. Cabinet calls on the community of Eldorado Park to assist the IPID and continue to work within the criminal justice system to ensure that justice prevails.

6.2. The findings will be handed over to the multi-agency Fusion Centre that is tasked with investigating COVID-19-related fraud and corruption. Findings include overpricing, government employees applying for relief they were not entitled to, potential fraud and the sidestepping of supply chain management rules and regulations.
6.3. Cabinet reiterates its resolve to continue to decisively pursue all those found to have abused these funds irrespective of who they are. The discrepancies that are exposed by the public through the information published on the National Treasury website (www.treasury.gov.za) will be followed up with the relevant departments.
B. Cabinet decisions
1. National Climate Change interventions
1.1. Cabinet approved the establishment of the Presidential Climate Change Coordinating Commission. This is in line with the Presidential Job Summit Framework Agreement signed during the Presidential Job Summit in 2018. The commission will coordinate the just transition of our country to a low carbon climate and resilient economy and society by 2050.
1.3. Cabinet also approved the submission of the country’s Low Emission Development (LED) Strategy to the UNFCCC Secretariat. This LED Strategy will advance the national climate change and development policy in a more coordinated, coherent and strategic manner. It provides mitigation measures focusing on four key sectors of the economy, namely Energy; Industry; Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use; and Waste.
2. National Waste Management Strategy (NWMS) 2020
2.1. Cabinet approved the 2020 NWMS to replace the 2011 NWMS. The waste management strategy gives into effect the terms of the National Environmental Management: Waste Act, 2008 (Act 59 of 2008). It directs the environmental protection programmes. It drives a sustainable and an environmentally friendly, inclusive economic growth, with three focus pillars – waste minimisation, effective and sustainable services, and waste awareness and compliance.
3.2. The agricultural colleges – which are currently under the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development – provide programmes that are aligned to higher education qualifications which include skills training and vocational programmes. The relocation of these colleges to the Department of Higher Education and Training will align them to the prescribed Higher Education Act of 1997 and will improve their governance and management.
5. Draft White Paper on Audio and Visual Content Services Policy Framework
5.2. The White Paper, amongst others, proposes new policy and regulatory changes and recommendations intended to reposition the audio-visual media sectors for future growth and promote investments.
6. Transformation of the Heritage Landscape
6.3. Cabinet endorses this process, which will contribute towards nation-building and ensure public spaces reflect the constitutional values of a post-colonial and post-apartheid democratic order. The cultural nation building parks will relocate all the historical details that depict colonialism and apartheid artefacts for future generations.

Distinguished Guests,
Fellow South Africans,
On this day, 31 years ago, President Nelson Mandela walked out of the gates of Victor Verster prison a free person, a living embodiment of the resilience and courage of the South African people.
For nearly 40 million years an extraordinary ecosystem has existed here at the southernmost tip of our continent.
The fynbos biome, which stretches across the Cape, has among the most distinctive features of any plants found on earth.
It can adapt to dry, hot summers and cold rainy winters. It is wondrous in its diversity.
Our national flower the Protea is a species of fynbos.
When I opened the third National Investment Conference last year I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.
What is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.
At least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.
Throughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.
Like a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.
We, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.
Like a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.
And yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.
For three centuries we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.
And for three centuries we resisted.
The flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.
The rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.
We have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.
As we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.
Nearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.
Since then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.
More than 45,000 people are known to have died.
Beyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.
There is no family, no community, and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with, and loved.
It is also a story of courage and resilience.
The resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they themselves are at risk of infection.
It is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.
It is a story of solidarity and compassion.
Of a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.
More than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.
It has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.
It is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.
The year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.
It must be a year in which we rise.
This is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary State of the Nation Address.
I will therefore focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.
First, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.
Second, we must accelerate our economic recovery.
Third, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.
And finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the state.
In the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.
Fundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.
South Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.
Driven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.
Nevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.
Had we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.
This year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.
This means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.
It also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.
Earlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.
This is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.
We applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.
Since this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.
While it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.
The first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.
We have secured 9 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
The first batch, of 80,000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.
Further consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500,000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
All provinces have roll-out plans in place as the first vaccines come through.
I wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.
In addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.
This will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the AU’s African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team facility as well.
Pfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.
We are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.
The health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.
All medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.
We will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.
The success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.
We are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes in particular in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.
As we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.
But it is not just this disease that we must defeat.
We must overcome poverty and hunger, joblessness and inequality.
We must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.
When I delivered the State of the Nation Address in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.
Our plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.
Budgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.
Over the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.
Poverty is on the rise. Inequality is deepening.
In the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% percent smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.
There were 1.7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.
Our unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30.8%.
As a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of 2020.
As we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.
The social and economic relief package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.
It identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our GDP – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.
A total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.
It is estimated that this grant lifted more than 5 million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.
To date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4.5 million workers through the Special UIF TERS scheme.
More than R1.3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.
In addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.
Around R18.9 billion in loans have been approved for 13,000 businesses through the loan guarantee scheme.
Fellow South Africans,
It is nearly four months since I stood here before a Joint Sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.
This evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must now take to restore growth and create jobs.
Since the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:
This evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must now take to restore growth and create jobs.
We knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.
We have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.
Construction has started and progress is being made on a number of projects.
Since the announcement of the Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68,000 households in the Gauteng province.
Similar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.
Two years ago I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.
New post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.
The Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.
The draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350,000 to 500,000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.
Progress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.
These include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.
The Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.
Work is underway to finalise project finance structuring for these projects.
Resources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2, and N3 highways.
These infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.
The R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.
This Fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.
Its approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300,000 student beds.
Another approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.
The second priority intervention of the Recovery Plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.
This will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.
Key to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.
This commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.
All social partners who participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan as part of our social compact have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.
They have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.
If we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.
Last year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1,000 locally produced products that must be procured from SMMEs.
As the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.
To this end, Cabinet approved the SMME Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1,000 products.
Furthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.
This will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.
In the State of the Nation Address last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.
Four master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.
Through the implementation of the poultry master plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.
South Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.
The sugar master plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.
Through the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85,000 workers.
Support for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.
Since the signing of the clothing, textile, footwear and leather masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.
We have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.
By the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.
Last week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.
This investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.
Nearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1.7 billion in procurement opportunities.
Toyota has invested in their KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.
This follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.
This year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.
This will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.
This year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area, which came into operation on the 1st of January following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the African Union.
The AfCFTA provides a platform for the South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.
To address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.
Last year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.
In November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.
Even under difficult economic circumstances, the Investment Conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.
Together with investment confirmed from the two previous investment conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our 5-year target of R1.2 trillion.
Firms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.
This shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.
We have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including by making it easier to start a business.
In the past year, more than 125,000 new companies have been registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.
We are making it easier for business to do business.
Our third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.
The largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.
We continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.
Our compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.
However, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.
The Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.
By the end of January 2021, over 430,000 opportunities have already been supported through the stimulus.
A further 180,000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.
These opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development, and small-scale and subsistence farming.
It involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.
These programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.
Nearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.
We will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.
In the State of the Nation last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1,000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.
While the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1,000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.
This provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15,000 start-ups by 2024.
Last year, we said we would establish a national Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.
I want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1.2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.
Of the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.
Despite this they persevered.
It is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.
The fourth priority intervention of the Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.
Restoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.
Eskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.
This will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.
Eskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.
We are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.
This requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.
In December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.
Over the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:
- The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities.
As part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2,600 megawatts from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.
This will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.
Recent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5,000 megawatts of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.
We will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.
This will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.
Eskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.
As we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socio-economic development and economic growth.
We are therefore working to fulfil our commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
Eskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.
Eskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.
This will be done in a way that stimulate investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.
Our work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.
The Commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.
We will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.
These reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.
This work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in National Treasury and the President’s office.
Operation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.
The completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.
After many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue TV transmitters from next month.
It is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.
The process for the licensing of high demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.
We hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.
In the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.
We will finalise and implement the revised raw water pricing strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national Water Resources Infrastructure Agency.
Our ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.
We are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the southern hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.
The rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.
These are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.
Work is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.
As international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full roll-out of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.
The revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs within one week to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.
The momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.
We will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.
To support our reform process, the Presidential State Owned Enterprises Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.
Overarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and Parliament in the next the financial year.
A centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.
The mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.
In the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.
In 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.
The favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.
This provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.
It is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution, expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.
To date, government has redistributed over 5 million hectares of land, totalling around 5,500 farms, to more than 300,000 beneficiaries.
This is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2.7 million hectares.
We are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.
During the course of the next financial year, we will establish a Land and Agrarian Reform Agency to fast-track land reform.
The public service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism doesn’t just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.
Advancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the public service is critical if we are to build a capable state.
Through the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.
In October last year, I signed off on Ministerial Performance Agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.
This will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the executive.
We remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.
We are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.
The Model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.
Working with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.
We are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.
As we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID so that we can ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.
Fellow South Africans,
Corruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.
The revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.
Testimony at the Commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.
It is therefore vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.
There has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.
Critical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.
There is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.
We have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.
We will shortly be appointing the members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.
When reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.
We established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.
The Fusion Centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.
The Special Investigating Unit was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.
As it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3.5 billion.
In a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act will come into operation on the 1st of April this year.
This will regulate public and private funding of political parties. Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.
Crime and violence continues to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.
Tackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.
Crimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.
We have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.
Task teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.
We are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.
Ending gender-based violence is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.
When I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence in April last year I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the criminal justice system to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.
To give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting gender-based violence.
To ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of gender-based violence cases.
We continue to provide care and support to survivors of gender-based violence.
In the State of the Nation Address last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.
Last year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses.
Several departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.
Last week we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.
Several South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.
Over the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.
Gender-based violence will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.
Equally we need to give attention to issues affecting children including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.
In the year ahead we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.
As we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.
Businesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.
Over the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business and labour, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.
We have therefore decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.
This has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.
We have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021 only for those sectors that have not been able to operate.
The conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at NEDLAC.
The National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the loan guarantee scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.
We will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.
Fellow South Africans,
Just as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.
Rebuilding our country requires a common effort.
It requires that every South African takes responsibility and plays their part.
Let us work together as government, as business, as labour and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.
Above all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.
On the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.
Madiba said:
“Now is the time to intensify the struggle on all fronts.”
“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”
In counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.
Just as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.
I am referring not to the glorious lineage of struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.
It is your resilience that will help this country recover.
In addition to the many challenges that beset our people we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days.
I wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.
It is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.
As we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem ‘I rise’.
She writes:
Out of the huts of history’s shame
I rise
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain
I rise
I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
People of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.
Let us march forward together to equality, to dignity and to recovery.
May God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.
I rise

A. Issues In The Environment
1. Attacks and killings of police officers condemned
1.1. Cabinet condemned the continued attacks and killings of police officers as not only barbaric but also a threat to national security. Members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) and other law-enforcement agencies, including private security companies, put their lives on the line daily to keep us safe; and they also deserve our support and protection.
1.3. Cabinet also commended the SAPS action in seizing cocaine with a street value of over R500 million from a fishing vessel on the Saldanha coast. The operation was led by detectives from the Organised Crime Narcotics Unit, in collaboration with other SAPS units.
1.4. The SAPS was also commended for seizing 400 vials, equivalent to about 2 400 doses, of fake Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine at a warehouse in Germiston, Gauteng. Officers also recovered fake masks and arrested three individuals.
1.5. Cabinet urges the public to avoid buying fake vaccines from unscrupulous peddlers who endanger the lives of unsuspecting citizens. Through the Department of Health, government has started to implement a free vaccination programme that will reach all South Africans who volunteer to be vaccinated. To date, Phase 1 of the vaccination programme at designated vaccination sites throughout the country has covered over 100 000 people.
2. Unfortunate death of a man in Braamfontein, Johannesburg

3.3. Farmers are advised to pre-cook any swill for at least an hour before feeding it to pigs, to ensure the inactivation of the ASF virus and other diseases of concern.
4. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures for the fourth quarter of 2020
4.1. Cabinet noted the GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2020 that were released by Statistics South Africa on Tuesday, 9 March 2021. Real GDP grew by 6.3%, largely as a result of the further easing of COVID‑19 lockdown restrictions. The outcome reflected strong growth in household final consumption and manufacturing output. As a result, for the full year of 2020, real GDP contracted by 7.0% – a better outcome than expected.
4.4. Cabinet remains confident that the economy will recover through the prioritised health interventions as well as continued collaborative efforts of government, business, workers and communities in implementing our Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.
5. Proudly South African Buy Local Summit & Expo
5.1.

5.3. Cabinet calls on South Africans and businesses to support our home-grown products and services, particularly during this economic recovery period, to boost economic growth and job creation.
6. Visit to the Biovac Storage facility
6.2. The Biovac Institute, a Cape Town-based biopharmaceutical company, is jointly owned by government and the private sector.

B. Cabinet decisions
1. National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS)
1.1. Cabinet received a briefing from the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology, Dr Blade Nzimande, on the current funding shortfall challenges faced by the NSFAS. These challenges have delayed the finalization of the registration of first-year university students.
2. Draft Position Paper for Land Administration and Land Tenure Reforms in Communal Areas
2.1. Cabinet approved the draft Position Paper on Land Administration and Land Tenure Reforms in Communal Areas for further consultations with relevant stakeholders. The proposed reforms provide a legal framework to initiate the process of transferring communal land to persons or communities whose tenure of land is legally insecure.
2.2. These reforms will also expand the communal asset base to empower communities to engage in cultural, social and economic activities of their choice. The consultations will culminate in the convening of the envisaged National Land Summit.
3. Vaccine procurement
3.1. Cabinet received a briefing by Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize and Finance Minister Tito Mboweni regarding contract negotiations for vaccine acquisition with different pharmaceutical companies. Cabinet considered some of the difficult terms in the contracts that are not aligned to the provisions of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act 1 of 1999) and acknowledged the deviations already granted by National Treasury in the interests of the lives of South Africans.
3.2. The deviations included prepayment provisions to ensure that South Africans have access to the vaccines as soon as possible. Cabinet supported the efforts of National Treasury and the National Department of Health to continue with the negotiations and ensure quick access to vaccines for all.
4. National State of Disaster
4.1. Cabinet approved the extension of National State of Disaster to 15 April 2021. This is done in terms of Section 27(5) (C) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act 57 of 2002).

1.2. The Bill introduces the provisions that empower employees to withhold their labour should they feel the environment is dangerous and unsafe, without being victimized by the employers.

A. ISSUES IN THE ENVIRONMENT
1. Temporary suspension of the Sisonke Vaccination Programme and the recommendation to lift it
1.1 Cabinet was briefed on the temporary suspension of the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) Sisonke Vaccination Programme, which was a precautionary measure which allowed South Africa’s scientists to review the South African data on the J&J vaccine. This followed the suspension of the J&J vaccination roll-out programme in the United States of America (USA) after six people who received the J&J vaccine developed a rare type of blood clot. Another reason for the temporary suspension was the decision by J&J to voluntarily suspend the roll-out of their vaccine in the Eurozone.
2. Vaccination roll-out programme
2.1 Cabinet welcomed the progress in the signing of the contract with J&J on the procurement of J&J vaccines for the full roll-out programme, and commended the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize and the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition, Mr Ebrahim Patel, for resolving the outstanding matters relating to the procurement of the vaccines without compromising the position of South Africa.
2.2 Furthermore, Cabinet welcomed the successful negotiation of an additional 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which brings the total doses of the Pfizer vaccine to 30 million. This means South Africa will be able to vaccinate 15 million people with the Pfizer vaccine instead of just 10 million.

9.2 The Bill of Rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 calls on us to respect the rights of all members of society without any form of discrimination.

Fellow South Africans,
This year, for the first time since the dawn of our democracy, the State of the Nation Address is not being delivered in the Chamber of the National Assembly.
As we entered this new year, a huge fire engulfed the seat of our democracy.
We all watched in outrage and sadness as the flames devoured the buildings in which our democratic Constitution was born, in which laws of transformation and progress have been passed, in which the freely-chosen representatives of the people have shaped our young nation.
For many, what happened in Parliament speaks to a broader devastation in our land.
It spoke to the devastation of a pandemic that over the past two years has taken the lives of tens of thousands of South Africans, put two million people out of work and brought misery to families.
The fire in Parliament reminded us of the destruction, violence and looting that we witnessed in parts of the country in July last year, of the more than 300 lives lost and many more livelihoods ruined.
As we reflect on the past year, we recall the words of President Thabo Mbeki who reminded us that: “Trying times need courage and resilience. Our strength as a people is not tested during the best of times.”
That we are gathered together in the Cape Town City Hall instead of the National Assembly Chamber reflects the extraordinary circumstances of this time.
It reflects the determination of the Presiding Officers of Parliament and indeed all the members of our two Houses that the work of this democratic institution should continue without interruption.
There are moments in the life of a nation when old certainties are unsettled and new possibilities emerge.
In these moments, there is both the prospect of great progress and the risk of reversal.
The path we choose now will determine the course for future generations.
That is why we are taking steps to strengthen our democracy and reaffirm our commitment to a Constitution that protects us all.
We are working together to revitalise our economy and end the inequality and injustice that impedes our progress.
We are standing together against corruption and to ensure that those who are responsible for state capture are punished for their crimes.
We are rebuilding the state and restoring trust and pride in public institutions.
There is agreement among a broad and diverse range of South Africans that fundamental reforms are needed to revive economic growth.
To achieve this, South Africa needs a new consensus.
A consensus that is born out of a common understanding of our current challenging situation and a recognition of the need to address the challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality.
But equally an environment in which South Africans can live a better life and unleash the energy of their capabilities.
This should also be a new consensus which embraces our shared responsibility to one another, and acknowledges that we are all in this together.
As the social partners – government, labour, business and communities – we are working to determine the actions we will take together to build such a consensus.
We have begun discussions on what trade-offs are needed and what contribution we will each need to make.
We have given ourselves 100 days to finalise a comprehensive social compact to grow our economy, create jobs and combat hunger.
This work will build on the foundation of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, which remains our common programme to rebuild the economy,
We remain focused on the priorities we identified in the State of the Nation Address last year:
- overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic,
- a massive rollout of infrastructure,
- a substantial increase in local production,
- an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods,
- the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.
To be effective, this social compact needs to include every South African and every part of our society.
No-one must be left behind.
Fellow South Africans,
When I last addressed the state of our nation, we were deep in the throes of the worst pandemic in more than a century.
Since COVID-19 reached our shores, we have endured successive waves of infection, the emergence of new variants and the devastating cost of nearly 100,000 recorded COVID-19 deaths.
South Africans have responded to this grave threat with courage and resilience, with compassion and restraint.
Over the past two years, we have taken unprecedented actions to strengthen our health system, build laboratory capacity and prevent infections.
The nation owes a great debt of gratitude to the dedicated health care workers and other frontline staff who put their health and their lives at risk to care for the ill and vulnerable during this pandemic.
The Fund has played a pivotal role in supporting the national health response and alleviating the humanitarian crisis.
I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the Solidarity Fund and the great many who came together in countless other initiatives to support those affected by the pandemic.
As the trajectory of the pandemic has continued to change, we have had to adapt and evolve.
Our approach has been informed throughout by the best available scientific evidence, and we have stood out both for the quality of our scientists and for their involvement in every step of our response.
So far, we have administered 30 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Consequently, nearly 42% of all adults and 60% of everyone over 50 is fully vaccinated.
We are now ready to enter a new phase in our management of the pandemic.
It is our intention to end the national state of disaster as soon as we have finalised other measures under the National Health Act and other legislation to contain the pandemic.
Nearly all restrictions on economic and social activity have already been lifted.
Vaccines have proven to be the best defence we have against illness and death from COVID-19.
If we all get vaccinated, continue to observe basic health measures and remain ever vigilant, we will be able to get on with our lives even with the virus in our midst.
The state of the nation is linked inextricably to the state of our economy.
In addition to the divides of race, geography and education, COVID-19 has exacerbated the divide between those who are employed and unemployed.
Last year, our unemployment rate reached its highest recorded level.
Unemployment has been caused by low growth, which has in turn resulted from a long-term decline in investment.
In the last year, we have benefited from a clear and stable macroeconomic framework, strong commodity prices and a better-than-expected recovery.
However, we have been held back by an unreliable electricity supply, inefficient network industries and the high cost of doing business.
We have been taking extraordinary measures to enable businesses to grow and create jobs alongside expanded public employment and social protection.
Around 80 per cent of all the people employed in South Africa are employed in the private sector.
The key task of government is to create the conditions that will enable the private sector – both big and small – to emerge, to grow, to access new markets, to create new products, and to hire more employees.
The problems in the South African economy are deep and they are structural.
When electricity supply cannot be guaranteed, when railways and ports are inefficient, when innovation is held back by a scarcity of broadband spectrum, when water quality deteriorates, companies are reluctant to invest and the economy cannot function properly.
With a view to addressing these challenges we are accelerating the implementation of far-reaching structural reforms to modernise and transform these industries, unlock investment, reduce costs and increase competitiveness and growth.
The electricity crisis is one of the greatest threats to economic and social progress.
In the last few days, we have once again been reminded of the fragility of our electricity system.
Load shedding continues to have a huge impact on the lives of all South Africans, disrupting business activities, and placing additional strains on families and communities.
Due to our aging power stations, poor maintenance, policy missteps and the ruinous effects of state capture, our country has a shortfall of around 4,000 MW of electricity.
As a result, several new energy generation projects will be coming online over the next few years. This includes:
In addition to closing the energy supply shortfall, we are implementing fundamental changes to the structure of the electricity sector.
Eskom has established a separate transmission subsidiary, and is on track to complete its unbundling by December 2022.
The utility has continued with its intensive maintenance programme, to reverse many years of neglected maintenance and underperformance of existing plants.
To regulate all of these reforms, Cabinet yesterday approved amendments to the Electricity Regulation Act for public comment.
These far-reaching amendments will enable a competitive market for electricity generation and the establishment of an independent state-owned transmission company.
Our economy cannot grow without efficient ports and railways.
Over several years, the functioning of our ports has declined relative to ports in other parts of the world and on the African continent. This constrains economic activity.
The agricultural sector, for example, relies heavily on efficient, well-run ports to export their produce to overseas markets.
Transnet will ask for proposals from private partners for the Durban and Ngqura Container Terminals within the next few months, which will enable partnerships to be in place at both terminals by October 2022.
Transnet will start the process of providing third-party access to its freight rail network from April 2022 by making slots available on the container corridor between Durban and City Deep in Gauteng.
This collaborative effort is already showing results in reduced disruptions to rail operations.
The poor state of passenger rail in South Africa has a direct and detrimental impact on the lives of our people.
We are therefore working hard to rehabilitate the passenger rail network in 10 priority corridors.
One of the greatest constraints on the technological development of our economy has been the unacceptable delay in the migration of broadcasting from analogue to digital.
As I announced in the State of the Nation Address last year, the other provinces will move to digital signal by the end of March 2022.
As part of this process, government will continue to subsidise low-income households so that they can access a set-top box and make the switch to digital TV.
Our communications regulator, ICASA, will commence with the auctioning of the high frequency communications spectrum in about three weeks from now.
This will unlock new spectrum for mobile telecommunications for the first time in over a decade.
In addition, we will facilitate the rapid deployment of broadband infrastructure across all municipalities by establishing a standard model for the granting of municipal permissions.
These reforms will revolutionise the country’s technological development, making faster broadband accessible to more people and reducing the costs of digital communications.
The world over, the ability to attract skilled immigrants is the hallmark of a modern, thriving economy.
We are therefore streamlining and modernising the visa application process to make it easier to travel to South Africa for tourism, business and work.
As we committed last year, the eVisa system has now been launched in 14 countries, including China, India, Kenya and Nigeria.
The revised Critical Skills List has been published for the first time since 2014, following detailed technical work and extensive consultations with business and labour. The updated list reflects the skills that are in shortage today, to ensure that our immigration policy matches the demands of our economy.
A comprehensive review of the work visa system is currently underway, led by a former Director-General of Home Affairs, Mr Mavuso Msimang.
This review is exploring the possibility of new visa categories that could enable economic growth, such as a start-up visa and a remote working visa.
Water is the country’s most precious natural resource.
It is vital to life, to development and to economic growth.
That is why we have prioritised institutional reforms in this area to ensure future water security, investment in water resources and maintenance of existing assets.
We have embarked on the process of institutional reform in capacitating the Department of Water and Sanitation and reviewing water boards in as far as their mandates are concerned and ensuring that they serve municipalities in terms of the District Development Model.
These reforms are being championed by the Minister of Water and Sanitation, who has visited every water source in the country.
A comprehensive turnaround plan is being implemented to streamline the process for water use license applications. The target is to clear the backlog of applications by June 2022 and to process 80% of all applications within 90 days during the next financial year.
Legislation has been prepared for the establishment of the National Water Resources Infrastructure Agency, and will be published for public comment within the next month.
The water quality monitoring system has been reinstated to improve enforcement of water standards at municipal level, and enable the Department of Water and Sanitation to intervene where water and sanitation services are failing.
We will review the policy and regulatory framework for industrial hemp and cannabis to realise the huge potential for investment and job creation.
While structural reforms are necessary for us to revive economic growth, they are not enough on their own.
This year, we are undertaking far-reaching measures to unleash the potential of small businesses, micro businesses and informal businesses.
These are the businesses that create the most jobs and provide the most opportunities for poor people to earn a living.
We have started discussions with social partners as part of the social compact process to review labour market regulations for smaller businesses to enable them to hire more people, while continuing to protect workers’ rights.
A new, redesigned loan guarantee scheme is being introduced to enable small businesses to bounce back from the pandemic and civic unrest.
This new bounce-back scheme incorporates the lessons from the previous loan guarantee scheme.
The National Treasury is working with industry stakeholders to finalise the scheme and will provide details soon.
We are reviewing the Business Act – alongside a broader review of legislation that affects SMMEs – to reduce the regulatory burden on informal businesses.
There are too many regulations in this country that are unduly complicated, costly and difficult to comply with. This prevents companies from growing and creating jobs.
We are therefore working to improve the business environment for companies of all sizes through a dedicated capacity in the Presidency to reduce red tape.
If we are to make progress in cutting unnecessary bureaucratic delays for businesses, we need dedicated capacity with the means to make changes.
Mr Nkosi has extensive experience in business, including as the CEO of Exxaro Resources, and is currently the Chairperson of the Small Business Institute.
The red tape team will identify priority reforms for the year ahead, including mechanisms to ensure government departments pay suppliers within the required 30 days.
The team will also work with other departments and agencies to unblock specific obstacles to investment and business growth. It will support current initiatives to simplify processes relating to property registration, cross-border trade and construction permits.
Infrastructure is central to our economic reconstruction and recovery.
Through innovative funding and improved technical capabilities, we have prioritised infrastructure projects to support economic growth and better livelihoods, especially in energy, roads and water management.
The Infrastructure Fund is at the centre of this effort, with a R100 billion allocation from the fiscus over 10 years.
The Infrastructure Fund is now working with state entities to prepare a pipeline of projects with an investment value of approximately R96 billion in student accommodation, social housing, telecommunications, water and sanitation and transport.
Government will make an initial investment of R1.8 billion in bulk infrastructure, which will unlock seven private sector projects to the value of R133 billion.
We are therefore upscaling the Welisizwe Rural Bridges Programme to deliver 95 bridges a year from the current 14.
Our South African National Defence Force is the implementing agent of the Welisizwe programme, and has demonstrated the expertise of SANDF engineers in bridge construction.
Earlier this week I was in Thakgalane village Limpopo to launch a new road that is going to make a huge difference in the lives of neighbouring communities. This road was constructed using block paving and other materials, which is a method that enables us to build durable roads faster and more cost-effectively.
The closing date for the first of the two-stage procurement process is scheduled to close later this month, with the preferred bidder likely to be announced in September 2022.
The new delivery mechanism will introduce a Special Purpose Vehicle, working with prominent DFIs and the private sector, to deliver school education infrastructure.
This approach is being piloted in schools in the Northern Cape and Eastern Cape.
This includes the development of a Hydrogen Society Roadmap for the next ten years as well as a Green Hydrogen Strategy for the Northern Cape, supporting the development of a green hydrogen pipeline worth around R270 billion.
The damage caused by the theft of scrap metal and cable on our infrastructure like electricity, trains and other vital services is enormous. We will take decisive steps this year both through improved law enforcement and by considering further measures to address the sale or export of such scrap metal.
An important pillar of our Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to revitalise our manufacturing base and create globally competitive export industries.
In the past year, we launched new master plans in the steel industry, furniture and global business services.
In the clothing industry, a number of retailers have announced ambitious localisation sourcing plans.
One of these retailers, Foschini, kindly made the suit that I am wearing today at its new formal wear factory, Prestige Epping.
Five years ago, more than 80 per cent of all Foschini Group merchandise came from the East. Today, nearly half of the merchandise is locally made.
The genuine leather shoes I am wearing were made by members of the National Union of Leather and Allied Workers from Bolton Footwear in Cape Town and Dick Whittington Shoes in Pietermaritzburg.
Nearly four years ago, we set ourselves a target of mobilising R1.2 trillion in new investment over five years.
By the time of the third South Africa Investment Conference in November 2020, we had reached R776 billion in investment commitments.
Next month, on the 24th of March, we will be holding the fourth South Africa Investment Conference in Johannesburg.
We will showcase the many investment opportunities available as South Africa continues its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and report back on the progress of previous commitments.
Following the resolutions of the African Union Summit over the past weekend, trading can now begin under the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement
South African companies are poised to play a key role in taking up the opportunities that this presents for preferential access to other African markets.
The Free Trade agreement is about Africa taking charge of its destiny and growing its economies faster.
We will continue to pursue Africa’s health sovereignty, working with other African countries and international partners to support the strengthening of the continent’s capacity to respond to pandemics.
We will increase our efforts to develop Africa’s ability to manufacture vaccines.
This production capability worth many billions of rands of production annually, has been put in place in less than two years.
While we help existing industries to grow, we are also nurturing new opportunities for growth and jobs.
Government and the private sector have worked closely together to grow the global business services sector from a small group of companies to one of the world’s leading players.
The global business services sector is on track to create 500,000 new jobs over the next few years.
The social economy, including early childhood development, nursing, social work and community services, has significant potential not only to create jobs, but to provide vital services that communities need.
Some of the country’s mature industries also have a lot to offer in revamping the industrial and manufacturing potential of our country.
The agriculture sector has significant potential for job creation in crops such as citrus, table and dried grapes, subtropical fruit, avocadoes, berries and nuts.
Masterplans in the sugar and poultry industries are contributing significantly to increased investment, improved production and transformation.
To attract investors into the mining minerals needed in the new global economy, we will soon be finalising our mining exploration strategy.
We will continue to support the development of the upstream gas industry, as it holds huge potential for job creation and broader economic development.
We will ensure that this is done in strict accordance with the environmental and other laws of our country, and that where there are differences, we work together to resolve them in the interest of our country and its people.
We live in one of the regions of the world that is most affected by climate change.
We frequently experience droughts, floods and other extreme weather events associated with global warming. Recently floods have affected a number of provinces including KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and the Eastern Cape.
In the last year, we have made important strides in the fight against climate change, and, at the same time, securing our economic competitiveness.
For the first time, our climate targets are compatible with limiting warming to 1.5°C.
Since I established the Presidential Climate Commission a little more than a year ago, it has done much work to support a just transition to a sustainable, inclusive, resilient and low-carbon economy.
At the international climate conference in Glasgow last November, South Africa struck a historic R131 billion deal with the European Union, France, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States.
This first-of-its-kind partnership will involve repurposing and repowering some of the coal plants that are reaching the end of their lives, and creating new livelihoods for workers and communities most impacted by this change.
To ensure that South Africa is able to derive the full benefit of this and other partnerships, I have appointed Mr Daniel Mminele, a former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, as Head of the Presidential Climate Finance Task Team to lead the mobilisation of funds for our just transition.
Properly managed, the energy transition will benefit all.
Renewable energy production will make electricity cheaper and more dependable, and will allow our industries to remain globally competitive.
Investments in electric vehicles and hydrogen will equip South Africa to meet the global clean energy future.
We will be able to expand our mining industry in strategic minerals that are crucial for clean energy, like platinum, vanadium, cobalt, copper, manganese and lithium.
We also have a unique opportunity in green hydrogen, given our world-class solar and wind resources and local technology and expertise.
All of these measures – from structural reforms to support for SMMEs, investments in infrastructure and the emergence of new sectors – will drive a turnaround in economic growth driven by the private sector growth over the coming years.
We know, however, that even with the best business environment and much faster rates of economic growth, it will take time for the private sector to create enough jobs for the millions of South Africans who need them.
Our intent is to leave no one behind.
That is why we are expanding public and social employment.
It has supported young women like Tracy Nkosi from Springs, who was employed as an education assistant at Welgedag Primary School, and who says this opportunity has motivated her to further her studies in the educational sphere.
It has also supported Mama Nosipho Cekwana from Impendle in KwaZulu-Natal who used her farming input voucher to buy maize, manure and supplements for her livestock.
The employment stimulus will also enable the Department of Home Affairs to recruit 10,000 unemployed young people for the digitisation of paper records, enhancing their skills and contributing to the modernisation of citizen services.
The Social Employment Fund will create a further 50,000 work opportunities using the capability of organisations beyond government, in areas such as urban agriculture, early childhood development, public art and tackling gender-based violence.
In addition to expanding public employment, we are providing support to young people to prepare them for work and link them to opportunities.
For several years, this has been an effective way to encourage companies to hire new work seekers. The changes to the incentive will make it easier for small businesses in particular to hire young people.
The Minister of Finance will announce the details of these changes in the budget.
We call on companies to support this effort, take up the incentive and give young people a place in the world of work.
Of these over 600,000 have been placed into employment opportunities.
A revitalised National Youth Service will recruit its first cohort of 50,000 young people during the next year, creating opportunities for young people to contribute to their communities, develop their skills and grow their employability.
The Department of Higher Education and Training will place 10,000 unemployed TVET graduates in workplaces from April 2022.
In preparing this State of the Nation address I was assisted by two young South Africans who are working as interns in the Presidency, Ms Naledi Malatji and Ms Kearabetswe Mabatle.
They told me about the pain felt by young people who find themselves with a qualification, but are unemployed because of lack of experience.
This forces many into jobs that have little or nothing to do with what they studied.
All of the measures I have outlined are essential to provide young people with the work experience that they need to take their first step into the labour market.
We are calling on the private sector to support these measures – and, wherever possible, to drop experience as a hiring requirement – to give as many young people as possible their first job.
As we work to grow the economy and create jobs, we will expand support to poor families to ensure that no person in this country has to endure the pain and indignity of hunger.
Our social protection system is among the greatest achievements of the democratic government, reaching more than 18 million people every month.
Without this support, millions more people would live in dire poverty.
Since the onset of COVID-19, the Social Relief of Distress Grant has provided support to more than 10 million unemployed people who were most vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic.
Some people used that money to start businesses.
Mr Thando Makhubu from Soweto received the R350 grant for 7 months last year, and saved it to open an ice-cream store that now employs four people.
As much as it has had a substantial impact, we must recognise that we face extreme fiscal constraints.
A fiscal crisis would hurt the poor worst of all through the deterioration of the basic services on which they rely.
Mindful of the proven benefits of the grant, we will extend the R350 SRD Grant for one further year, to the end of March 2023.
During this time, we will engage in broad consultations and detailed technical work to identify the best options to replace this grant.
Any future support must pass the test of affordability, and must not come at the expense of basic services or at the risk of unsustainable spending.
It remains our ambition to establish a minimum level of support for those in greatest need.
Expanding access to land is vital for our efforts to reduce hunger and provide people with meaningful livelihoods.
We are moving ahead with land reform in terms of the Constitution, and anticipate the approval of the Expropriation Bill during this year.
The establishment of the Agriculture and Land Reform Development Agency will be finalised this year.
The Department of Public Works and Infrastructure will finalise the transfer of 14,000 hectares of state land to the Housing Development Agency.
We have enough arable land to support millions of thriving small-scale farmers in poultry, livestock, fruit and vegetables.
Through the Presidential Employment Stimulus and the Solidarity Fund, over 100,000 farmers have already received input vouchers to expand their production.
This scheme has proven to be effective and impactful.
The agriculture sector has also recognised the importance of supporting small-scale farmers and integrating them into value chains.
Through the sugar master plan, the industry has provided R225 million to over 12,000 small-scale sugar cane growers as part of a R1 billion commitment to support black farmers.
We will be expanding the provision of input vouchers and calling on other sectors to join this effort, so that we can collectively reach up to 250,000 small-scale farmers this year.
None of our efforts to revive our economy will succeed if we do not tackle the scourge of corruption once and for all.
While the definitive conclusion has yet to be delivered at the end of this month, the first two parts of the report make it plain that there was indeed ‘state capture’.
We will, as the Commission’s first report recommends, strengthen the system to protect whistle-blowers, who are a vital safeguard in the fight against corruption and who take huge personal risk in reporting wrong-doing.
The relevant law enforcement agencies are taking the necessary steps to address the immediate concern about the safety of whistle-blowers.
Many individuals and companies that the Commission has found were responsible for state capture must now be held to account.
We will be appointing a new head of the Investigating Directorate following the departure of Adv Hermione Cronje from that position.
These empowering provisions has geared the Investigating Directorate to more effectively pursue the investigations emanating from the Commission.
To ensure that the prosecuting authority remains true to its constitutional obligation and to ensure transparency, we are developing a framework for private sector cooperation that will be managed through National Treasury.
There are also discussions underway with the Judiciary for the creation of special court rolls for state capture and corruption cases.
While we have taken decisive steps to end the era of state capture, we know that the fight against corruption is far from over.
Even as the country was suffering the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies and individuals were conspiring with public officials to defraud the government of billions of rands in COVID-related contracts.
As soon as evidence emerged of this corruption we acted.
We withdrew certain emergency procurement regulations, set up a fusion centre that brought together various law enforcement agencies, published the details of all COVID-related contracts online and instituted the most extensive investigation that the Special Investigating Unit has undertaken since its formation.
As a result, 45 matters, with a combined value of R2.1 billion, have been enrolled with the Special Tribunal.
The SIU has referred 224 government officials for disciplinary action and referred 386 cases for possible prosecution to the NPA.
The fight against corruption will take on a new intensity thanks to the outcomes of the State Capture Commission, the strengthening of law enforcement agencies and the implementation of new anti-corruption practices in the public service.
State-owned enterprises play a vital role in our economy.
From water and roads, to energy and ports, to defence and aviation, these strategic assets are necessary to keep our country running.
It is essential that we reverse their decline, and position them to contribute positively.
We have therefore embarked on several immediate measures to restore these companies to health, at the same time as we undertake far-reaching reforms that will make our SOEs more efficient, competitive, accountable and sustainable.
The Presidential SOE Council, which I appointed in 2020, has recommended that government adopt a centralised shareholder model for its key commercial state-owned companies. This would separate the state’s ownership functions from its policy-making and regulatory functions, minimise the scope for political interference, introduce greater professionalism and manage state assets in a way that protects shareholder value.
As part of this, preparatory work has begun for the establishment of a state-owned Holding Company to house strategic SOEs and to exercise coordinated shareholder oversight.
Any recommendations would be subject to extensive consultation with all stakeholders.
We are taking steps to safeguard our democracy, protect our economic infrastructure and build safer communities for all.
Earlier this week, we released the report of the expert panel into the civil unrest in July last year.
The report paints a deeply disturbing picture of the capabilities of our security services and the structures that exist to coordinate their work.
The report concludes that government’s initial handling of the July 2021 events was inept, police operational planning was poor, there was poor coordination between the state security and intelligence services, and police are not always embedded in the communities they serve.
The expert panel said that if the violence has exposed anything it was the poverty and inequality that is the root cause of the desperation of the people of South Africa.
The expert panel found that Cabinet must take overall responsibility for the events of July 2021.
This is a responsibility that we acknowledge and accept.
We will, as recommended by the panel, develop and drive a national response plan to address the weaknesses that the panel has identified.
We will begin immediately by filling critical vacancies and addressing positions affected by suspensions in the State Security Agency and Crime Intelligence.
We will soon be announcing leadership changes in a number of security agencies to strengthen our security structures.
The staffing of the public order policing unit of the South African Police Service will be brought to an appropriate level, with appropriate training courses in place.
The ongoing damage to and theft of economic infrastructure has damaged confidence and severely constrained economic growth, investment and job creation.
This requires a focused and coordinated response.
Government has therefore established specialised multi-disciplinary units to address economic sabotage, extortion at construction sites and vandalism of infrastructure.
We will make resources available to recruit and train an additional 12,000 new police personnel to ensure that the SAPS urgently gets the capacity it needs.
Another area of immediate attention will be the re-establishment of community policing forums to improve relations and coordination between local police and residents of the areas they serve.
I will be approaching Parliament’s Presiding Officers to request that Parliament plays a key role in facilitating inclusive processes of consultation.
The security services have been tasked by the National Security Council to urgently develop implementation plans that address the range of recommendations made by the expert panel.
This year, we are intensifying the fight against gender-based violence and femicide through implementation of the National Strategic Plan on GBVF and other measures to promote the empowerment of women.
Earlier this month, I signed into law three new pieces of legislation, which has strengthened the criminal justice system, promoting accountability across the state and supporting survivors.
The implementation of this legislation will go a long way to ensuring that cases are successfully prosecuted, that survivors are protected and that there are more effective deterrents in place.
We have made significant progress in reducing the backlog in DNA processing, reducing it from 210,000 exhibits in April 2021 to around 58,000 at present.
However, the fight against gender-based violence will never be won unless, as a society, we mobilise all formations and all citizens behind a sustained programme of social action.
As the COVID-19 pandemic has starkly demonstrated, a nation’s health is inextricably linked with its economic progress and social development.
We will therefore continue with the work underway to ensure universal health coverage for everyone in South Africa, regardless of their ability to pay.
While public hearings on the National Health Insurance Bill are continuing in Parliament, much progress is being made in preparing for the introduction of NHI.
More than 59 million people are registered in the Health Patient Registration System.
By September 2021, more than 56,000 additional health workers had been recruited and more than 46,000 community health workers integrated into the public health system.
For the last two years, the education of our children and young people has been severely disrupted.
As we return to normal educational activity, we will work harder to ensure that all learners and students get the quality education they need and deserve.
Fellow South Africans,
Government must work for the people.
We will soon be finalising a framework for the professionalisation of the public service.
This will include tighter measures for recruitment of public servants, continuous professional development through the National School of Government and partnerships between state bodies, professional associations and universities.
This year, we will continue with the implementation of the District Development Model.
This Model brings all three spheres of government together with other social partners in every district to grow inclusive local economies and improve the lives of citizens.
In particular, the DDM facilitates integrated planning and budgeting across spheres of government and improves integration of national projects at a district level.
While there are many parts of the state that require much work, there are institutions that continue to serve the people of this country effectively and efficiently.
One such institution is the South African Revenue Service, which will be 25 years old this year.
While SARS was badly damaged by state capture, it has made remarkable progress in restoring its integrity, credibility and performance.
Since its formation, SARS has collected some R16 trillion for the country’s social and economic development. This revenue has enabled government to improve the lives of millions through the provision of health care, education, social grants and other basic services.
A capable state is not only about the quality of public servants and the efficiency of institutions.
It is also, fundamentally, about how citizens are empowered to participate.
We must work together to ensure that platforms like schools governing bodies and community policing forums are more active and inclusive.
A vibrant civil society is crucial for a capable state and for development.
We will therefore be working with social partners to convene the long-awaited social sector summit.
This Summit will seek to improve the interface between the state and civil society and address the challenges that NGOs and CBOs face.
Our country has suffered several damaging blows in recent times.
A confluence of forces, many of them outside of our control, has brought us to where we are now.
We face steep and daunting challenges.
Indeed, we are engaged in a battle for the soul of this country.
I ask every South African to rally together in our fight against corruption, in our fight to create jobs, in our fight to achieve a more just and equal society.
We have faced many crises in our past, and we have overcome them.
We have been confronted with difficult choices, and we have made them.
In trying times, we have shown courage and resilience
Now, we must do so again.
Let us forge a new consensus to confront a new reality, a consensus that unites us behind our shared determination to reform our economy and rebuild our institutions.
Let us get to work.
Let us rebuild our country.
And let us leave no one behind.
I thank you.
Cabinet concurred with the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment to appoint the following Board members of the NFAC for three years:

Fellow South Africans,
Good evening, sanibonani, molweni, dumelang, goeienaand, lotjhani, ri perile, ndi madekwana.
Thank you for the opportunity to address Parliament and the nation.
It is also the 50th anniversary of the declaration by the National Party regime that District Six would be a whites only area, leading to the forced removals of more than 60 000 residents.
The year 2016 also marks the 20th anniversary of the signing into law by Madiba, of the Constitution of the Republic. The signing took place in Sharpeville on 10 December 1996.
We are proud of our democracy and what we have achieved in a short space of time. Our democracy is functional, solid and stable.
Compatriots, the Constitution, which has its foundation in the Freedom Charter, proclaims that South Africa belongs to all who live in it. A lot has been done to promote inclusion and a non-racial society.
However, the journey to a non-racial society has not yet been completed.
The nation was shaken last month when racism reared its ugly head on social and electronic media, causing untold pain and anger. There is a need to confront the demon of racism. Human Rights Day, 21 March, will be commemorated as the national day against racism this year. It will be used to lay the foundation for a long-term programme of building a non-racial society.
Compatriots, I would like to remind you of a few other important anniversaries.
The year 2016 marks 60 years since the women’s march to the Union Buildings to demand an end to pass laws. We are happy to have in our midst Ms Sophie de Bruyn, who was among the heroic leaders of that historic march.
We also acknowledge the former president of the Black Sash, Ms Mary Burton. We acknowledge the organisation’s track record in fighting for human rights, justice and equality.
This year also marks 40 years since the landmark 16 June student uprising in Soweto.
We welcome the photographer who shot the famous photograph of Hector Pieterson carried by Mbuyisa Makhubu with his sister Antoinette, Mr Sam Nzima.
We also salute the class of 1976 for their bravery in standing up against the brutal apartheid regime. We acknowledge one of the activists of that era, the Deputy Secretary of Parliament, Ms Baby Tyawa, who is in our midst.
This year we also mark 30 years since the ambush and brutal killing of the Gugulethu Seven by the apartheid police in March 1986.
The University of Fort Hare celebrates its centenary, which is a critical milestone in the liberation history of not only our country but the continent. The national celebrations will take place on 20 May.
Let me recognise uMntwana wakwaPhindangene, the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party who is a former student of the university.
The year 2016 also marks the centenary of the battle of Delville Wood in France, which took place during the First World War.
Scores of black soldiers fought in the war but were treated badly due to the colour of their skin.
A memorial that will restore their dignity and humanity is scheduled to be unveiled in July this year in France.
Compatriots, allow me as well to recognise three special guests who are also with us today:
• the Chairperson of the National Church Leaders Forum and Archbishop of Cape Town, Archbishop Thabo Makgoba,
• Archbishop Daniel Matebesi, the President of the National Interfaith Council of South Africa, and
• Bishop Zipho Siwa, the Presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa and the President of the South African Council of Churches.
Madam Speaker and Madam Chairperson,
A resilient and fast growing economy is at the heart of our radical economic transformation agenda and our National Development Plan (NDP).
When the economy grows fast it delivers jobs. Workers earn wages and businesses make profits.
The tax base expands and allows government to increase the social wage and provide education, health, social grants, housing and free basic services ¬– faster and in a more sustainable manner.
Our economy has been facing difficulties since the financial crisis in 2008. We embarked on an aggressive infrastructure development programme to stimulate growth.
Our reality right now is that global growth still remains muted. Financial markets have become volatile. Currencies of emerging markets have become weak and they fluctuate widely.
The prices of gold, platinum, coal and other minerals that we sell to the rest of the world have dropped significantly and continue to be low.
Because our economy is relatively small and open, it is affected by all of these developments. Our economy is also affected by domestic factors such as the electricity constraints and industrial relations which are sometimes unstable.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank predict that the South African economy will grow by less than 1% this year. The lower economic growth outcomes and outlook suggest that revenue collection will be lower than previously expected.
Importantly, our country seems to be at risk of losing its investment grade status from ratings agencies. If that happens, it will become more expensive for us to borrow money from abroad to finance our programmes of building a better life for all, especially the poor.
The situation requires an effective turnaround plan from us. It is about doing things differently and also acting on what may not have been acted upon quickly before.
I will share a few points that we believe would make a difference.
First, our country remains an attractive investment destination. It may face challenges, but its positive attributes far outweigh those challenges.
We must continue to market the country as a preferred destination for investments. This requires a common narrative from all of us as business, labour and government.
If there are any disagreements or problems between us, we should solve them before they escalate. This is necessary for the common good of our country.
We have had fruitful meetings with business, including the high level meeting with chief executive officers on Tuesday (9 February) this week.
We have heard the suggestions from the business community on how we can turn the situation around and put the economy back on a growth path.
We have heard the points about the need to create the correct investment support infrastructure.
Government is developing a One Stop Shop/Invest SA initiative to signal that South Africa is truly open for business. We will fast-track the implementation of this service, in partnership with the private sector.
Such an initiative requires that government removes the red tape and reviews any legislative and regulatory blockages.
We have established an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Investment Promotion which will ensure the success of investment promotion initiatives.
Compatriots, we have heard the concerns raised about the performance of state owned enterprises and companies.
Many of our state-owned companies (SOCs) are performing well. The South African National Roads Agency Limited has built some of the best roads in Gauteng and in many parts of the country. These make us the envy of many parts around the globe.
The Trans Caledon Tunnel Authority has constructed dams of varied capacities, thus making it possible for our people to have access to safe drinking water.
Transnet has built rail infrastructure which has enabled our country’s mines to move massive bulk of commodities through our ports to markets around the globe.
Eskom, in spite of the challenges, still manages to keep the economy going, against all odds.
Our development finance institutions such as the Industrial Development Corporation or Development Bank of Southern Africa and others have provided finance for infrastructure, various industries and agricultural businesses without fail, even in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
For the SOCs to contribute to the successful implementation of the NDP, they must be financially sound.
They must be properly governed and managed. We will ensure the implementation of the recommendations of the Presidential Review Commission on State-owned Enterprises, which outlines how the institutions should be managed.
The Deputy President chairs the Inter-Ministerial Committee which is tasked with ensuring the implementation of these recommendations.
We have to streamline and sharpen the mandates of the companies and ensure that where there are overlaps in the mandates, there is immediate rationalisation.
Those companies that are no longer relevant to our development agenda will be phased out.
Government departments to which they report, will set the agenda and identify key projects for the SOCs to implement, over a defined period. Proper monitoring and evaluation will be done.
These interventions are essential for growth and also for the reduction of national debt levels.
Compatriots, we must take advantage of the exchange rate as well as the recent changes of visa regulations, to boost inbound tourism.
SA Tourism will invest R100 million a year to promote domestic tourism, encouraging South Africans to tour their country.
We have heard concerns from companies about delays in obtaining visas for skilled personnel from abroad. While we prefer that employers prioritise local workers, our migration policy must also make it possible to import scarce skills.
The draft migration policy will be presented to Cabinet during the course of 2016.
We have heard the appeals for policy certainty in the mining sector, especially with regards to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill.
The Bill was referred back to Parliament last year. We await Parliament to conclude the processing, which we trust will be done expeditiously.
Compatriots, we need to empower small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) to accelerate their growth. Access to high-quality, innovative business support can dramatically improve the success rate of new ventures.
The Department of Small Business Development was established to provide such targeted support to small business.
We urge big business to partner with new manufacturers including businesses owned by women and the youth, as part of broadening the ownership and control of the economy.
Compatriots, we are proud of our Top 10 ranking in the World Economic Forum competitiveness report with respect to financial services.
Maintaining and indeed improving our ranking is important to our competitiveness as a country.
It is also fundamental to our ambition to become a financial centre for Africa.
The banks, through the Banking Association of South Africa, are to launch a project aimed at establishing a centre of excellence for financial services and leadership training.
This will ensure that as a country we can attract, nurture, develop and retain the best talent in financial services in our country and across our continent.
They will work with the Minister of Finance and National Treasury to get this done. We believe that this will over time ensure that we can expand the pool of financial skills and broaden the job opportunities for many young people.
This strategic project from the banking sector is a positive and encouraging outcome of our engagement with business this week.
Together we move South Africa Forward!
Compatriots, we have made an undertaking to spend public funds wisely and to cut wasteful expenditure, but without compromising on the core business of government and the provision of services to our people.
I would like to announce some measures this evening. Overseas trips will be curtailed and those requesting permission will have to motivate strongly and prove the benefit to the country.
The sizes of delegations will be greatly reduced and standardised. Further restrictions on conferences, catering, entertainment and social functions will be instituted.
The budget vote dinners for stakeholders hosted by government departments in Parliament, after the delivery of budget speeches will no longer take place. The Minister of Finance will announce more measures and further details in the budget vote speech on 24 February.
The executive management and boards of public agencies and SOCs must undertake similar measures. I also invite Premiers of all nine provinces as well as mayors to join us as we begin eliminating wasteful expenditure within government. I trust that Parliament and the judiciary will also be persuaded to consider the implementation of similar measures.
Compatriots, a big expenditure item, that we would like to persuade Parliament to consider, is the maintenance of two capitals, Pretoria as the administrative one and Cape Town as the legislative capital.
We believe that the matter requires the attention of Parliament soon. Compatriots, we all have a lot to do to turn the economy around and to cut wastage. We will go through a difficult period for a while, but when the economy recovers, we will be proud of ourselves for having done the right thing.
Compatriots, I would now like to report back on the undertakings made last year.
During the State of the Nation Address in February 2015, I announced the Nine-Point Plan to respond to sluggish growth.
The Nine-Point Plan consists of:
a. Revitalisation of the agriculture and agro-processing value-chain;
b. Advancing beneficiation adding value to our mineral wealth;
c. More effective implementation of a higher impact Industrial Policy Action Plan;
d. Unlocking the potential of SMMEs, cooperatives, township and rural enterprises;
e. Resolving the energy challenge;
f. Stabilising the labour market;
g. Scaling-up private-sector investment;
h. Growing the ocean economy;
i. Cross-cutting areas to reform, boost and diversify the economy;
i. Science, technology and innovation
ii. Water and sanitation
iii. Transport infrastructure
iv. Broadband roll-out
v. SOCs.
We have made significant progress in the implementation of the plan.
Progress has been made to stabilise the electricity supply. There has been no load shedding since August last year, which has brought relief to both households and industry alike.
Government has invested R83 billion in Eskom, which has enabled the utility to continue investing in Medupi and Kusile, while continuing with a diligent maintenance programme.
Additional units from Ingula power station will be connected in 2017, even though some of them will begin synchronisation this year. The multiple bid windows of the Renewable Independent Power Producer Programme have attracted an investment of R194 billion.
This initiative is a concrete example of how government can partner with the private sector to provide practical solutions to an immediate challenge that faces our country.
In 2016, government will select the preferred bidders for the coal independent power producer. Request for proposals will also be issued for the first windows of gas to power bids.
The nuclear energy expansion programme remains part of the future energy mix.
Our plan is to introduce 9 600 megawatts of nuclear energy in the next decade, in addition to running Koeberg Nuclear Power Plant.
We will test the market to ascertain the true cost of building modern nuclear plants.
Let me emphasise that we will only procure nuclear on a scale and pace that our country can afford.
Compatriots, our government, through the Department of Trade and Industry, introduced a number of incentives in the past few years to boost investments in the manufacturing sectors especially textiles, leather and the automotive sectors.
Progress has been made in these sectors.
The incentives for the automotive sector have attracted investments of over R25 billion over the last five years. We welcome key investments from Mercedes, General Motors, Ford, Beijing Auto Works, the Metair group, BMW, Goodyear and VW.
The clothing and textile sector has also been successfully stabilised after a difficult few years.
Multinational companies such as Nestle, Unilever, Samsung and Hisense have also affirmed South Africa as a regional manufacturing hub.
They have retained and expanded their investments in new plants.
Indeed the progress made in manufacturing has certainly demonstrated that the incentive programmes are effective and attractive to investors.
Construction has begun in at least five agri-parks, which are: West Rand in Gauteng, Springbokpan in North West, Witzenberg in the Western Cape, Ncora in the Eastern Cape and Ekangala in Mpumalanga.
The agricultural programmes must empower women farmers as well. Allow me to introduce the winner of the Female Entrepreneur of the Year 2015, Ms Julia Shungube, from Nkomazi Local Municipality in Mpumalanga.
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
Land reform remains an important factor as we pursue transformation. I spoke about the 50/50 policy framework last year, which proposes relative rights for people who live and work on farms.
Twenty-seven proposals have been received from commercial farmers and four are being implemented in the Eastern Cape and the Free State.
I also announced the Regulation of Land Holdings Bill, which would place a ceiling on land ownership at a maximum of 12 000 hectares and would prohibit foreign nationals from owning land. They would be eligible for long term leases. The draft Bill will be presented to Cabinet in the first semester of the year.
We also announced the reopening of land claims for people who had missed the 1998 deadline. The number of new land claims that have been lodged stood at close to 120 000 as of December last year.
Compatriots, as we are aware, five provinces have been seriously affected by drought, namely North West, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Limpopo and Mpumalanga.
Government provides relief to affected communities. Isomiso sixakile impela ezifundazweni eziningi. Imfuyo iyafa kanti nezolimo zisele emuva. Isikhathi esinzima lesi.
Uhulumeni uzoqhubeka nokuxhasa abalimi kanye nokusiza imiphakathi ngezimoto ezithwala zamanzi.
(The drought that is currently taking place in most of our provinces is really devastating. Livestock is dying and as a result, the agricultural sector is going through a difficult period. These are tough times indeed. Government will continue to assist farmers and also provide water-tank services to communities).
Let me take this opportunity to commend the civil society initiative, Operation Hydrate and others for the provision of water relief to many communities in distress.
The building of water infrastructure remains critical so that we can expand access to our people and industry.
The first phase of the Mokolo and Crocodile Water Augmentation project in Lephalale area in Limpopo is fully operational. It will provide 30 million cubic meters of water per annum.
The raising of the Clan William Dam wall in the Western Cape entails raising the existing dam level by 13 metres to provide additional water supply.
To curb water wastage, the Department of Water and Sanitation has begun its programme of training 15 000 young people as artisans.
Madam Speaker, Madam Chairperson,
On improving labour relations, we welcome the agreement reached by social partners at National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC) on the principle of a national minimum wage.
Deliberations continue on the level at which the minimum wage must be placed.
It is important to emphasise that the national minimum wage should be implemented in a manner that does not undermine employment creation, the thriving of small businesses or sustained economic growth.
We have heard the concerns of labour about the Tax Amendment Act that I signed into law in December, following its passing by Parliament.
Government is in discussion with the Congress of South African Trade Unions about the matter and a solution is being sought.
Compatriots, only a few years ago, our mining sector was in turmoil especially on the platinum belt. The situation has improved and we commend business and labour for the progress made.
Another positive development in the mining sector was the Leaders’ Declaration to Save Jobs which was signed by mining industry stakeholders in August 2015.
We urge the parties to implement the agreement and to continue seeking ways of saving jobs.
We appeal to business again that retrenchments should not be the first resort when they face difficulties.
Compatriots, in 2014 we launched the popular Operation Phakisa Big Fast results methodology and implemented it in the ocean economy, health, education and mining sectors.
Seven billion rand has been committed in new port facilities, following the adoption of a Public- Private-Partnership model for port infrastructure development by Transnet National Ports Authority.
Compatriots, we were concerned that South Africa did not own vessels while we are surrounded by about 3 000 km of a coastline.
Through the oceans economy segment of Operation Phakisa, we are trying to solve this challenge.
I am pleased that two bulk-carrier vessels have been registered in Port Elizabeth, and a third tanker in Cape Town under the South African flag.
Another positive Operation Phakisa development has been the launch of a fuel storage facility here in Cape Town, bringing an investment of R660 million.
Aquaculture appears to be an important growth area within the oceans economy segment of Operation Phakisa.
We continue to promote innovation within the Nine-Point Plan programme.
The Department of Science and Technology will finalise the Sovereign Innovation fund, a Public-Private funding partnership aimed at commercialising innovations that are from ideas from the public and the private sectors.
Government will fast-track the implementation of the first phase of broadband roll-out to connect more than 5 000 government facilities in eight district municipalities over a three-year period.
Funding to the tune of R740 million over a three-year period has been allocated in this regard.
Compatriots, a lot of work was done in the social sector as well in the past year.
Government has responded to the financial shortfall arising from the zero per cent university fee increase, as agreed in meeting with students and vice-chancellors last year.
The Minister of Finance will provide the details of education shortfall funding in the Budget Speech.
I have appointed a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into higher education. We urge all stakeholders to cooperate with the commission and help ensure its success.
The HIV policy turnaround in 2009 led to a massive roll-out of HIV testing and treatment for 3,2 million people living with the virus.
This has contributed immensely to healthier and longer lives for those infected.
We acknowledge the contribution of partners in the South African National AIDS Council, which is chaired by the Deputy President.
Our next step is to revive prevention campaigns especially amongst the youth. The Minister of Health will soon announce a major campaign in this regard.
I am also happy to announce that the state-owned pharmaceutical company, Ketlaphela, has been established. The company will participate in the supply of anti-retroviral drug to the Department of Health from the 2016/17 financial year.
Meanwhile, the White Paper on National Health Insurance was released in December and is aimed at improving healthcare for everyone in South Africa.
Compatriots, local government elections will be held within three months after 18 May, the date of the last elections.
We urge all citizens who are over the age of 18 to register to vote during the first registration weekend, 5 and 6 March 2016.
We urge the youth, in particular who are turning 18 years of age this year, to register in their numbers for this first-ever opportunity to cast their votes.
Our Back to Basics local government revitalisation plan was launched in September 2014 and 2015 has been the year of intensive implementation.
In this second phase of implementation, national government will engage in more active monitoring and accountability measures.
This includes unannounced municipal visits, spot checks of supply chain management processes, the implementation of recommendations of forensic reports, site visits of Municipal Infrastructure Grant funded projects, and increased interventions to assist struggling municipalities.
A 10-point plan of Back to Basics priority actions has been developed to guide this next phase.
The plan includes the promotion of community engagement, which is absolutely critical to enable communities to provide feedback on their experience of local government.
I already undertook a walkabout at Marabastad taxi and bus rank in Pretoria on Monday (8 February) to speak to informal traders and commuters.
The majority of complaints and issues raised related to municipal services.
They would like the Tshwane municipality to clean the area and also to fix some broken sewerage pipes. Traders said they needed and were prepared to pay.
They alerted me that many people in Elandspoort receive RDP houses but instead of occupying them, they either sell them or rent them out to other people.
Mrs Baloyi, who runs a stall, complained about nyaope drug addicts who steal goods from traders. Other commuters said I must visit Kwaggafontein in the former KwaNdebele and see the lack of service delivery. I will visit the area soon.
I was also able to speak to foreign nationals who said they queue daily to apply for documentation from the Department of Home Affairs. We will continue to visit communities to hear their concerns and suggestions. Issues raised during the visit will be followed up by the respective departments.
Compatriots, the South African Police Service is undergoing a turnaround and has adopted the Back to Basics approach to management to rebuild the organisation and to improve performance at all under-performing police stations.
We note sadly, as well that 57 police officers have been murdered to date during the 2015/16 financial year. We condemn this criminality strongly.
We urge the police to defend themselves when attacked, within the confines of the law.
Compatriots, the African continent remains central to our foreign policy engagements.
South Africa continued to support peace and security and regional economic integration through participation in the African Union and the Southern African Development Community initiatives.
We continued to assist sister countries in resolving their issues, for example, in Lesotho and South Sudan.
The agreement by BRICS nations on the New Development Bank or BRICS Bank came into force and the bank is envisaged to approve its inaugural projects in April this year.
We participated in the India-Africa Summit as well as the Forum on Cooperation between Africa and China as we strengthened these important partnerships.
China announced investments of US$50 billion of which South Africa will receive US$10 billion for infrastructure, industrialisation and skills development.
On North-South cooperation, we continued our engagements with the European Union (EU) as a bloc, which is our largest trading partner and foreign investor.
Over 2 000 EU companies operate within South Africa, creating over 350 000 jobs.
South Africa’s relations with the United States of America and Canada continue to strengthen, especially in the areas of economy, health, education, energy, water, safety and security, capacity building and the empowerment of women.
The renewal and expansion of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) provides a platform for the enhancement of industrialisation and regional integration. All outstanding issues around AGOA are being attended to.
Compatriots, we extend good wishes to all athletes who have qualified for the Olympic Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro. We encourage participation in several programmes aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles and nation building.
These include the National Recreation Day, the Nelson Mandela Sports and Culture Day; the World Move for Health Day, the Golden Games and the Andrew Mlangeni Golf Development Day.
Compatriots, a committee has been established to coordinate the participation of our performing arts legends in nation building activities in the country.
The Living Legends committee is chaired by playwright, Mr Welcome Msomi, working with music icon, Ms Letta Mbulu, as deputy chairperson.
We are also happy that musicians and actors, among others, heeded our call to unite and have formed the Creative Industries Federation of South Africa. The Presidency has established the Presidential Creative Industries Task Team to support our artists.
Compatriots, to achieve our objectives of creating jobs, reducing inequality and pushing back the frontiers of poverty, we need faster growth.
In the NDP, we set our aspirational target growth of 5% per year, which we had hoped to achieve by 2019.
Given the economic conditions I have painted earlier on, it is clear that we will not achieve that growth target at the time we had hoped to achieve it.
The tough global and domestic conditions should propel us to redouble our efforts, working together as all sectors. In this regard, it is important to act decisively to remove domestic constraints to growth.
We cannot change the global economic conditions, but we can do a lot to change the local conditions.
Let us work together to turn the situation around. It can be done.
I thank you.
As the year closes, Cabinet joins South Africans in commemorating the third anniversary of Nelson Mandela's passing on 5 December 2013.
“Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity’s belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul, and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for all.” – Nelson Mandela
Madiba subscribed to the values of our Constitution and the vision of a free, just and united nation that underpins the society that we must work towards. To do this, South Africans need to be united by a shared vision of a better society.
1. Implementation of government programmes
South African Economy
1.1. Cabinet commends the effective partnership of Team South Africa – constituted by government, business, labour and all South Africans – for working together to safeguard South Africa’s investment rating. Through hard work and unified action, the economy and investor confidence has been stabilised in these difficult economic times.
President Jacob Zuma initiated Team SA to get different sectors to work together to reignite our economy, attract investment and create jobs for our people. These positive developments should motivate us to work even harder to move South Africa forward.
1.2. Moody’s Investor Services, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s kept South Africa's sovereign debt credit rating status above sub-investment grade.
Concerns raised by the agencies have been noted and together with our social partners we are fast tracking interventions to turnaround the economy. Cabinet remains confident that the path set out in the National Development Plan (NDP) and government’s planned fiscal consolidation, together with the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan, will help South Africa remain an investment-grade country.
1.3. Cabinet notes that South Africa’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2% in the third quarter. The main contributors to GDP growth were the mining and quarrying sector, finance, real estate and business services, and general government services. The agriculture, forestry and fishing sector contracted by -0.3%; manufacturing by -3.2%; electricity, gas and water by -2.9%; and trade, catering and accommodation by -2.1%. Drought is still the largest contributor to the decline in the agriculture sector.
1.4. The handover of title deeds to five Bahurutshe communities by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform, Mr Gugile Nkwinti, is one of the biggest land claims to be settled at Motsane Game Farm outside Zeerust in the North West.
More than fifty-four thousand (54 280) hectares of land, which includes a game farm, is being restored.
Also, the launch of the pilot project of the Policy Framework on Strengthening the Relative Rights of People Working the Land (50/50 policy) for North West at the Stars Away Farm in Ottoshoop, Zeerust, follows the conclusion of an agreement which will see farmworkers and the farmer become co-owners of the farming enterprise.
1.5. Water infrastructure is part of government’s National Infrastructure Plan to transform our economic landscape while creating new jobs and strengthening the delivery of basic services.
The launch of the Mokolo and Crocodile River (West) Water Augmentation Project demonstrates government’s commitment to respond to the needs of citizens. The water transfer infrastructure supplies water to the Lephalale Local Municipality, Eskom's power stations (Matimba and Medupi), the Zeeland water treatment plant, and Exxaro's Grootegeluk Mine. It also transfers water from the Crocodile River West near Thabazimbi to the Lephalale area.
1.6. The Welgedacht Wastewater Treatment Works near Springs, Gauteng, underwent an extension to cope with the increased demand for wastewater treatment.
In order to alleviate the pollution in the Vaal River System, the Department of Water and Sanitation refurbished the Oranjeville Waste Water Treatment Plant in the Metsimaholo District Municipality and Leeuwkuil Waste Water Treatment Plant in the Emfuleni District Municipality at a cost of R44.4 million. Also, over R300 million has been set aside to upgrade 26 dysfunctional waste water treatment works in parts of Gauteng and the Free State.
1.7. The Orange-Senqu River Basin Commission is currently underway from 5 to 9 December 2016 at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park. South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana and Namibia are the member countries to the commission. The commission implements the strategic trans-boundary water resources management framework and works towards the long-term development goals in the basin.
1.8. The new Pan-African platform, Africa Trade Week 2016 was held from 28 November to 2 December under the theme: “Advancing Socio-Economic Structural Transformation through Intra-Africa Trade”. This provided a comprehensive, integrated and inclusive platform for policy dialogue between various trade-related constituencies.
The Minister of Trade and Industry, Dr Rob Davies, engaged on the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) Negotiations, which was launched during the African Union (AU) Assembly held in South Africa on 15 June 2015. The CFTA aims to boost intra-Africa trade and to build an integrated Africa of one billion people and GDP of approximately 2.6 trillion US dollars.
1.9. The second edition of Science Forum South Africa is being held under the theme “Igniting conversations about science” from 8 to 9 December at the CSIR International Convention Centre. Scientists, policy-makers, students, academics and the public are engaging on pertinent issues around science, technology and innovation.
The focus is on social sciences, and debates include the minimum living wage and the reported 60% dropout rate at South Africa’s universities. Other topics include climate change-induced migration, public perceptions of genetically modified organisms, food security, and how social science can shape Africa’s future.
Local Government
1.10. The recently held South African Local Government Association (SALGA) National Conference from 28 November to 1 December 2016 concluded with a recommitment to the Back to Basics programme and to promote inclusive living through the implementation of the Integrated Urban Development Framework (IUDF). The IUDF espouses the vision of creating “liveable, safe, resource-efficient cities and towns that are socially integrated, economically inclusive and globally competitive, where residents actively participate in urban life”.
Activism for no violence against women and children
1.11. The current 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children 2016 campaign under the theme: “Count Me In: Together Moving a Non-Violent South Africa Forward”, launched by President Zuma, has set in motion the #365 days of Activism. As part of broadening access of government services to all, especially those who are vulnerable, the launch of a disability enhancement tool for the 24-hour Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Command Centre will enable members of the deaf community to access and use the professional counselling services of the centre.
1.12. Cabinet underscores its condemnation to any and all acts of violence motivated by prejudice. Government continues to address the safety issues of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. The Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill, which is in the consultative phase, will strengthen enforcement and prosecution.
Health
1.13. The World AIDS Day commemoration on 1 December 2016, under the theme “It is in our hands to end HIV and TB”, led by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, was boosted by the launch of new clinical trials for the HIV and AIDS vaccine known as HVTN 702.
Cabinet applauds the South African scientists who are leading this critical research. The trial is one of the biggest in the world and bears testimony to the competency of the scientific and medical fraternity.
1.14. Government continues in its partnership with all stakeholders – including PHILA and the South African National AIDS Council – to achieve an AIDS-free generation, stop all new HIV infections, end the TB epidemic and encourage all our citizens to make healthy, responsible choices.
South Africa has achieved its targets for antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and we now have the largest ARV programme in the world, with 3.4 million people on treatment in 2015. The prevention of mother-to-child transmission target was reached, with a marked decline from more than 3.5% in 2010 to 1.8% in 2014. Sexual transmission of HIV among youth aged 15-24 years declined from 410 000 in 2011 to 330 000 in 2014. New TB infections and TB deaths declined, but the targets to achieve a 50% reduction in TB deaths were not reached.
Over 800 million male condoms and over 20 million female condoms were distributed in the last financial year. The HIV-testing campaign saw 35 million HIV tests done over the five-year period. South Africa has over 300 GeneXpert machines deployed countrywide and over 2.1 million GeneXpert tests have been conducted. In 2016 South Africa implemented the universal test and treat programme where every HIV-positive person is put on treatment regardless of their CD4 cell count.
Disaster Management
1.15. A meeting of SADC Ministers responsible for disaster risk management took place on 26 November 2016 in Mauritius chaired by the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Mr Des Van Rooyen.
The meeting approved the Regional Disaster Preparedness and Response Strategy and set up a Task Force to finalise the proposal on the disaster preparedness and response fund. The SADC secretariat will convene a joint meeting of Ministers for Disaster Management and Finance to consider the proposed disaster preparedness and response fund.
Youth
1.16. As part of the programme to develop young people, the fifth national Youth Camp at the 3 South African Infantry Battalion, was opened next to Kimberley in the Northern Cape by the departments of Social Development and Defence and Military Veterans, under the theme #40YearsOn – Youth still moving South Africa forward.
This brings together 1 000 young people across race, ethnicity, gender, class and language from all provinces with a view to promote national identity, nation-building, social cohesion, patriotism and active citizenry among young people of South Africa. Discussions will be held around the many challenges they face as youth.
Since the first National Youth Camp in 2012, youth participants have undertaken a number of projects in their communities aimed at bringing about development. The Youth Camp provides an opportunity for young people, who are now leaders in their own right in their communities, to share their experiences with other youth.
National Development Plan
1.17. The NDP is a long-term vision and plan that serves as a blueprint for the work that needs to be done to achieve a prosperous society for South Africa by 2030. The core priorities of the NDP are to reduce poverty, unemployment and inequality.
1.18. Cabinet calls on all sectors of society, business, labour and civil society to play their part in advancing the brand identity of the NDP by highlighting the implementation of the NDP through co-branding initiatives that are catalytic in implementing the plan.
1.19. Cabinet undertook a photoshoot to symbolise a call to action that sees all sectors of society using the NDP brand identity.
2. Cabinet decisions
2.1. Cabinet supports the Minister of Transport, Ms Dipuo Peters, in directing Transnet National Ports Authority, in terms of Section 79, subsection (1) of the National Ports Act, 2005 (Act 12 of 2005), to amend the Terminal Operator’s Agreement to allow the Strategic Fuel Fund to handle cargoes of Liquefied Petroleum Gas at the Port of Saldanha Bay. The Strategic Fuel Funds current lease and license will also be extended with a minimum of 25 years to provide commercial and operational certainty for sustainable investment in the oil and gas sector.
This is in line with government priorities relating to Operation Phakisa on growing the Oceans Economy and broader goals outlined in the NDP, to promote economic growth and to boost job creation.
2.2. Cabinet was briefed on the status of the Acid Mine Drainage “Emergency Works” project that was implemented as a short-term solution for Acid Mine Drainage mitigation in the Witwatersrand goldfields. A long-term solution will be implemented in line with recommendations set down by the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC).
Being a water-scarce country, the Acid Mine Drainage project capitalises on water conservation and reuse, ensuring the provision of adequately treated drinking water and a move away from the sole reliance on clean water in industrial applications. Further, the project also mitigates pollution and other negative impacts.
2.3. Cabinet approved the National Sanitation Policy, 2016 for implementation. This follows an extensive period of consultation for inputs. The policy places the well-being of people at the centre of development and is forward looking in terms of improved levels of services, innovation and appropriate technology to ensure sustainability to improve the lives of the poor.
2.4. Cabinet approved the release of the National Crime Statistics report for the first two quarters of 2016/17, by the Minister of Police, Mr Nkosinathi Nhleko. The quarterly releases enables government to monitor key targets, in particular the reduction of reported serious crimes, as set out in the MTSF and could be used as early warning to strengthen the crime-prevention operations and strategies of various government departments. Minister Nhleko will release these crime statistics before 31 January 2017.
2.5. Cabinet approved the Second Country Report on the implementation of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (Children’s Charter) for submission to the AU in January 2017.
The Children's Charter was adopted by the African Union in 1990 and is a comprehensive instrument that sets out rights and defines universal principles and norms for the status of children. The Second Country Report outlines progress made on the implementation of a suite of government-wide policies and legislation to promote, protect and realise children’s rights. The report also recognises the continuous and progressive efforts to strengthen implementation of programmes and projects to promote the rights of children.
2.6. Cabinet was briefed on the outcomes from the 17th Meeting of the Conference of Parties (CoP17) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which was hosted by South Africa from 24 September to 5 October 2016.
Parties agreed to measures and actions to be implemented within the mandate of the Convention to ensure legal international trade remains sustainable and illegal trade is eradicated. Parties also agreed to recognise that people need to benefit from the sustainable utilisation of its natural resources, including from legal international trade.
2.7. Cabinet approved South Africa’s negotiating positions for the 13th Meeting of the CoP to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP13) and its protocols to be held in Cancun, Mexico from 4 to 17 December 2016.
CBD COP13 will consider the following key issues: Resource Mobilisation; Mainstreaming and the Integration of Biodiversity within and across sectors; and Marine and Coastal Biodiversity.
2.8. Cabinet was briefed on progress made by government in responding to the attacks on foreign nationals and addressing the root causes. Guided by the IMC on Migration, government implemented Operation Fiela, which brought the violence under control. From 1 July to 30 September 2015, 702 operations were conducted, which led to 9 741 arrests of which 3 158 were of foreign nationals.
Work on the root cause of the attacks determined that there was an increased competition for economic opportunities, resources and public services between foreign nationals and poor unemployed South Africans residing in townships and informal settlements.
Final approval of the White Paper on International Migration is planned for March 2017, and will include the “First Safe Country” principle that will assist in managing refugees and asylum seekers. Cabinet also approved the Refugee Amendment Bill in September 2015 for tabling in Parliament and Home Affairs submitted a document to the Southern African Development Community inviting discussion on how to deal with migration in the region. Land was also acquired in Lebombo, Mpumalanga in 2015 to set up asylum-processing centres closer to the border.
2.9. Cabinet was updated on implementation of the National Evaluation System detailed in the Annual Report on Evaluation 2016 to 2017 and also approved the sixth National Evaluation Plan 2017 to 2018.
The National Evaluation System is being institutionalised across government and is building a body of evidence following 16 economic evaluations: six agricultural/ rural evaluations; seven human settlements evaluations and an evidence map; five children evaluations; and four safety evaluations (with two additional safety evaluations starting).
Cabinet reinforced that departments should allocate necessary funding for effective and efficient monitoring and evaluation to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of programmes.
2.10. Cabinet was briefed on the findings and recommendations from the study conducted by the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) on the geographic accessibility of Thusong Service Centres, government’s one-stop service centres providing information and services to communities.
The study recommends a more equitable distribution of Centres and the clustering of existing service points of key departments so as to maximise the number of people who can access services, reduce the distance and cost of travelling; and minimise the need for additional infrastructure investment. In addition to the 197 existing Thusong Centres, the study identified and recommends 67 additional locations where access to service needs to be improved to meet population demands and reduce travel distances to Service Centres.
2.11. Cabinet was briefed on the provisions of the directive on compulsory capacity development, mandatory training days and maximum entry requirements for the Senior Management Service (SMS). This will improve the quality of human resources, which is a critical factor in the capacity of government to deliver on its mandate and contributes to the NDP focus on building a capable and developmental state.
2.12. Cabinet approved the 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment to the remuneration levels of members from the South African Human Rights Commission, with effect from 1 April 2016.
3. Bills
Cabinet approved for the introduction of the following Bills into Parliament:
3.1. Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill of 2016, which strengthens the criminal justice system as envisaged in the NDP, by combatting cybercrime, establishing capacity to deal with cybersecurity and protecting critical information infrastructures.
It contributes towards building safer communities as envisaged in the National Development Plan. In this regard, government is committed to put in place measures to build confidence and trust in the secure use of Information Communications Technologies.
3.2. Traditional Courts Bill of 2016, contributes to realising a developmental, capable and ethical state by regulating the role and functions of the institution of traditional leadership in the resolution of disputes, in accordance with the Constitution of South Africa.
This will improve access to justice services by all with the view to promote social cohesion.
3.3. Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill of 2016, which amends the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 (Act 51 of 1977).
The amendments provide the courts with wider discretion in issuing orders in respect of vulnerable groups, namely persons with a mental disability. The courts will also be assisted to make legally and procedurally correct decisions that are based on reports of expert panels that have been correctly constituted.
4. Upcoming events
4.1. Zambia’s President Edgar Lungu is on a State Visit to South Africa from 8 to 9 December 2016. It is expected that a Joint Permanent Commission between the two countries will be inaugurated, which will oversee the 1996 General Agreement and the 1999 Declaration of Intent which gives effect to bilateral agreements.
The two countries have good bilateral and economic relations, with Zambia remaining one of South Africa’s top three trading partners on the African continent. South African exports to Zambia in 2014 were R29.5 billion, while Zambia‘s exports to South Africa reached R3.6 billion.
4.2. Cabinet approved for South Africa to host the Information and Communications Technology Africa 2017 Summit in partnership with AfricanBrains in July 2017. This will be led by the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services.
4.3. On 9 December 2016, our government in partnership with the United Nations (UN) Office on Drugs and Crime and the University of South Africa, will once again mark International Anti-Corruption Day under the theme: “United Against Corruption”. which resonates with the injunction of the National Development Plan to foster an active citizenry that will partner with government in the fight against corruption.
Since 2014 we have ensured the conviction of a total of ninety (90) persons and legal entities for corruption and corruption related matters. Thirty-two were for cases where the total amount involved is R5 million per case amounting to about R3.8 billion. The remaining fifty-eight (58) persons convicted were for amounts less than R5 million per case, the total amount involved was in the order of R188 million.
In the same period, we have been able to obtain eight hundred and seventy-one (871) freezing orders totalling R7.65 billion as well as one thousand and eighty-nine (1089) forfeiture/confiscation orders to the value of R2.86 billion.
Corruption is being addressed through a suite of mechanisms, which include: the Code of Conduct for the Public Service; the establishment of specialised anti-corruption units such as the South African Police Service (SAPS) Organised Crime Unit; the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation; the National Prosecuting Authority’s Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit; the Asset Forfeiture Unit and the Financial Intelligence Centre. Efforts are boosted by Specialised Commercial Crime Courts and the creation of the national and sectoral anti-corruption hotlines.
4.4. 2016 marks the 20th anniversary of the signing into law of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 by former President Nelson Mandela in Sharpeville on 10 December 1996.
The Constitution laid the foundation for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the people. It is the product of a long process of struggle and multiparty political negotiations in which politicians, lawyers and representatives of civil society played a role. It is regarded as one of the most progressive and transformative constitutions in the world.
To commemorate the 20th anniversary under the theme “Celebrating 20 years of the Constitution – transforming society and uniting the nation”, government will undertake a series of community engagements and programmes to increase awareness and knowledge of the Constitution, its values and human rights. A national event will be held at the George Thabe Stadium in Sharpeville on Saturday, 10 December 2016.
4.5. The national event to commemorate the Day of Reconciliation on Friday, 16 December 2016 under the theme “Bridging the Divide towards a Non-Racial Society”, will take place at Gopane Black Aces Ground, Zeerust in North West.
4.6. Cabinet extends its best wishes to all South Africans for the upcoming festive season. We call on our fellow South Africans to assist individuals and families in their communities, especially children, older persons and people with disabilities.
4.7. The announcement by the SAPS that shopping malls will also become a priority during the festive season goes further in ensuring that South Africans are and feel safe. The deployment of police members and trainees at various malls across the country forms part of the Back-to-Basics approach of the SAPS to improve visibility, enhance policing and curb various crimes which tend to spike during the festive season.
Cabinet urges all South Africans, in line with the responsibilities outlined in our NDP, to be part of the solution and ensure a safe and enjoyable festive season for all.
As South Africans take to the road to visit loved ones and family members, please be alert and ensure that vehicles are roadworthy. Adherence to the speed limit, wearing safety belts and not driving while under the influence are non-negotiables in ensuring your own safety and that of other people around you. As we enjoy the upcoming festive period, please continue to use water wisely and efficiently as water remains a scarce resource.
5. Past year
The past year witnessed a growing number of investment initiatives that have been announced in the country, which demonstrate confidence by the international investment community in South Africa’s economy. It further demonstrates that our country is on a path to recovery and continues to be a viable investment destination. Implementation of the Nine-Point Plan, the MTSF and interventions such as Operation Phakisa have placed us on a higher trajectory to realise Vision 2030 of the NDP.
We created new trade opportunities aimed at opening market access and deepening existing economic ties. This was implemented through bilateral meetings with targeted Government Ministries, meetings with potential investors, engagements with various Chambers of Commerce as well as taking part in national pavilions and tourism promotion events.
These initiatives yielded increased sales of manufactured value-added exports by R 1.2 billion which brings the cumulative total for the year to R3.8 billion. Further, the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows pipeline represents potential FDI of R13.1 billion particularly in the energy and chemicals sector. This brings the total potential FDI for 2016 to R30 billion.
International tourism continues to be an important part of our economic diplomacy efforts, contributing to job creation and economic growth. Tourist arrivals figures went up by 14, 8% in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. A total of about R39.3 billion foreign direct spend was achieved during the first months of 2016, which contributes to job creation and sustains the local economy. This information confirms that South Africa remains a popular destination for international tourists.
As part of the National Infrastructure Plan we have seen infrastructure investments in education, health, water, energy and transport. All of which have created employment and improved the lives of our people. The stabilisation of the grid has strengthened reliable electricity supply for South Africa.
Various international agenda engagements resulted in a suite of memorandums of understanding and agreements being signed. These serve as a catalyst for economic development initiatives and to meet our goals from the NDP.
We held a successful Local Government Election and also hosted, in the spirit of Ubuntu, various mega events. These included: AfricaCom; Africa Internet Governance Forum; COP17) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); the 35th International Geological Congress; the 21st International AIDS Conference and many others. South Africa has become an international destination of choice.
Cabinet is pleased that many students in higher education institutions across the country have responded positively to calls to save the 2016 academic programme and commends the thousands of students who wrote their final year examinations.
Our national sporting teams and athletes held our flag high with their performances and spirit at the 2016 Rio Olympics as well as other sporting events. South Africans in various fields have inspired us with their skills and talents and received national and international accolades. South Africa is a winning nation.
6. Sympathy and congratulatory messages

The Commission on Restitution of Land Rights has, during the period 1 April 2016 to 31 October 2016 paid-out close to a billion rand in compensation to land claimants who were dispossessed of their rights in land.
1.11. The findings of the recent Institute of Race Relations report: “Life in South Africa: Reasons for Hope” shows that life in South Africa is better today compared to 20 years ago.
In 2015 real per capita GDP was 33 per cent higher than in 1994; disposable income growth per capita increased from R23,686 in 1994 to R33,660 in 2015 (an increase of 42 per cent), the total number of people with jobs doubled from 7.9-million in 1994 to 15.6-million in 2015; access to formal housing increased by 131.3 per cent from 1996 to 2016; university enrolment rates increased by 281.4 per cent from 211,756 in 1985 to 807,663 in 2014; the number of new HIV infections dropped from 646,806 in 1999 to 321,497 in 2015; there has been a 62.5 per cent increase in healthcare professionals in the public sector between 2000 to 2015; and the murder rate has fallen by 49.3 per cent since 1994.
These highlight that while there are challenges, life for South Africans has improved over the past two decades. Cabinet encourages all sectors of society to continue to build on the advances of our nation since the dawn of democracy. There remain more positives for the country than there are negatives.
IMPLEMENTATION OF GOVERNMENTS PROGRAMME OF ACTION:
1.12. Government’s fifth National Imbizo Focus Week which was held from 7 to 13 November 2016 under the theme “Together we move South Africa forward: Our future – make it work“ saw South Africans actively engaging with government. This period of intense interaction further contributes to an informed and active citizenry; a critical element in delivering the National Development Plan (NDP) Vision 2030.
President Jacob Zuma initiated the week during an Imbizo at Marhulana Primary School in Tembisa, Gauteng where a fully equipped computer laboratory was handed over.
1.13. The opening of the Swartkopfontein road and bridge between South Africa and Botswana unlocks a new chapter in linking the South African border posts at Swartkopfontein to Botswana’s border post at Ramotswa. The upgraded road and bridge infrastructure, at an investment of R78.5 million resulted in 51 full time jobs being created over the 23-month contract period, with labour sourced from both countries.
1.14. The Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme, under the Minister of Trade and Industry, Rob Davies is creating jobs in and around townships and rural communities. The programme was implemented in response to a call by President Jacob Zuma to work towards full scale industrialisation and inclusive growth amongst others. The Department of Trade and Industry has so far invested R22.5m in the revitalisation of the Komani Industrial Park. During the 1st phase of the revitalisation programme, seven small micro medium enterprises were appointed as sub-contractors to the value of R5, 3million. Seventy-one local labourers were employed, of which 63 per cent were youth.
The Black Industrialist programme, with an objective to increase role-players in the manufacturing sector, has to date supported 22 Black Industrialists and 1500 jobs have been created. R1.5 billion has been injected to support these industrialists.
1.15. The Global Entrepreneurship Week was launched in Johannesburg last Friday by Deputy President, Cyril Ramaphosa, supported by Minister Lindiwe Zulu. It is taking place from 14 to 20 November 2016, and is the largest gathering of innovators and entrepreneurs who launch start-ups by bringing ideas to life, driving economic growth and stimulating socio-economic development. Cabinet recognises business and social partners in bringing GEW to South Africa, namely the Gauteng Provincial Government, City of Johannesburg, Hollard, Microsoft, IDC, SABS, SAB, SEA Africa, the Global Entrepreneurship Network and the Kauffman Foundation. Over 80 partner events will take place during this period. The GEW is a lead-up to the Global Entrepreneurship Congress (GEC) which will be hosted for the first time on the African continent in Johannesburg during March 2017, where over 5 000 delegates from 160 countries are expected to attend.
1.16. Minister Nomvula Mokonyane on 14 November 2016 launched the Drakenstein Waste Water Treatment Plant and handed it over to the Drakenstein Municipality in the Western Cape. The project value is approximately R 171 000 000 and has benefited the local authority and community by providing experience and training in construction; recruitment of local people; and sourcing of materials from local suppliers and manufacturers.
The provision of a basic water service to the community contributes to the improvement of the quality of water in the Berg River and alleviates the negative impact of poor quality irrigation water.
1.17. Water and sanitation are at the very core of sustainable development. The Department of Water and Sanitation is embarking on a Sanitation Campaign which will culminate with World Toilet Day on 19 November 2016, which is used to create awareness, to educate and apply efforts to ensure that everyone has access to decent sanitation services.
South Africa has committed itself to accelerate the provision of water and sanitation services, and as such restore the dignity particularly of those people from previously disadvantaged communities. The Bucket Eradication Programme is aimed at addressing the legacy of bucket toilets as a form of sanitation system in four provinces, namely the Eastern Cape, Free State, North West and the Northern Cape. A total of 25 091 buckets have been eradicated to date and a total of 27 147 buckets remain to be completed.
1.18. The graduation of young people from the four-year National Rural Youth Corps (NARYSEC) programme on 17 November 2016 complements government's job creation programmes and initiatives. The programme, which was launched in 2010, is a youth skills development and employment programme that helps to transform young people in the rural areas from being job seekers to creators of jobs.
1.19 The Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) Municipal Summit is underway from 15 to 17 November 2016 under the theme “See, Feel and Experience Public Employment Programmes”, at St George Conference Centre in Gauteng. EPWP is a key government initiative, which contributes to decent work and sustainable livelihoods, education, health, rural development, food security and land reform, including the fight against crime and corruption.
The summit focuses on the practical components of the programme by providing an opportunity to share experiences and best practices. This enhances government efforts of providing employment opportunities and skills acquisition through training which in turn revitalises poor communities.
More than 7 million work opportunities have been created through EPWP from 2004 to 2016. This indicates successful implementation of the programme by all spheres of government, municipalities and civil society. EPWP Phase 3 is in its third year of implementation – and has seen the introduction of universal principles which govern the implementation of the programme and its main task is to promote community involvement where EPWP projects are implemented. This also allows transparency in terms of recruitment.
1.20. The successful migration from analogue to digital broadcasting for residents within the Square Kilometre Array area in the Northern Cape, means that these residents are among the first to experience the full range of benefits of improved sound and picture quality associated with digital television.
The announcement by Minister Muthambi to complete the process of migrating to the broadcasting digital system by December 2018 in a provincial phased approach is underway, having already started in the Northern Cape and Limpopo. Registrations are open in the Free State, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. Registrations will also open in the North West, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape and Gauteng at a later stage.
1.21. The analogue switch off forms part of the country’s Broadcasting Digital Migration process in the country. Poor households who qualify for the government subsidy are urged to register for free STBs at their local Post Office branches.
1.22. Cabinet was also briefed on the plan to exhume the remains of political activists who were hanged during apartheid. There were at least 130 political prisoners who were hanged for politically-related offences between 1960 and 1990, after which the death penalty was suspended. These patriots will be properly buried in their places of origin.
This process follows the public launch of the Gallows Exhumation Project on 23 March 2016 at the Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre, to commence with the exhumation of the remains of 83 political activists over a period of six months before the end of 2016/17.
1.23. Cabinet welcomed the successful conclusion of the 3rd Session of the Bi-National Commission between Botswana and South Africa led by President Jacob Zuma and his counterpart President Seretse Khama Ian Khama to further deepen economic cooperation between the two countries.
Fast tracking work on the Lesotho Highlands Water Transfer Project, implementation of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Industrialisation Strategy and Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan to create regional value chains and manufacturing capacities, and cooperation in border management to combat cross-border crimes such as rhino and elephant poaching, were among the areas explored.
South Africa reaffirmed its support for the SADC candidate for the post of the AU Commission Chairperson, Honourable Dr. Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, the Minister of International Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of Botswana.
1.24. President Jacob Zuma concluded a successful Working Visit to Addis Ababa, in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia where he attended the African Union (AU) High Level Committee on Libya meeting to review and discuss the peace and security situation in Libya. The Committee discussed and agreed on a number of issues that would help find a lasting solution to challenges facing the people of Libya. As members of the African Union we want to see peace and stability in Libya and the committee agreed that as Africa we need to extensively persuade all involved parties in Libya to find an African solution to the problems facing the country.
President Zuma also participated in the Second Extraordinary Summit of the Volunteering Nations of the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC). The aim of this Summit was to discuss the status of the ACIRC Force following the conduct of the UTULIVU AFRICA I and II Command Post Exercises (CPX) and the verification of the pledged capabilities from May 2014 to April 2015. Volunteering countries to the ACIRC, which include South Africa, resolved to take a lead in bringing about African solutions for African challenges without the intervention of external forces.
2. Upcoming events
2.1. The 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children takes place annually from 25 November (International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women) to 10 December (International Human Rights Day). Other key commemorative days during this period include World Aids Day on 1 December and the International Day for People with Disabilities on 3 December.
The 2016 theme for the 16 Days of Activism is “Count me in: together moving a non-violent South Africa forward” and is being sustained through a year-long approach in working continuously with communities.
President Jacob Zuma will on 25 November 2016 launch the National Dialogues which will see District Municipalities convene dialogues throughout the year. The dialogues will incorporate skills development and empowerment for communities, especially for women, as well as service delivery improvement in terms of access to justice and counselling and health services. All South Africans have a duty to be active participants in the fight against violence against women and child abuse.
2.2. International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane and the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation, Mr Sergey Donskoy, will co-chair the 14th Session of the Joint Intergovernmental Committee on Trade and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) between South Africa and the Russia on Friday, 18 November 2016, in Pretoria.
This session is expected to agree on specific plans of action to expedite implementation of existing commitments within all the sectors of ITEC, including trade, investment and banking; mineral resources; energy; agriculture, forestry and fisheries; transport; science, technology and space; water resources; and education and justice.
2.3. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will lead a delegation of ministers and non-governmental stakeholders on 19 November 2016 to the Youth Career Development Expo at the Nkowankowa Stadium in the Greater Tzaneen Local Municipality, Limpopo.
The expo will provide career guidance and information on further education and training opportunities to learners who are in Grades 10 to 12, to unemployed youth, and to youth who have dropped out from high school. The Youth Career Development Expo is part of government’s work to advance young people, particularly their participation in the economy, so that they can take their rightful place in our society.
2.4. Following the Local Government Elections, public participation in the governance of communities remains critical to influence municipal planning, in a manner which best addresses the needs of citizens.
The Local Government Municipal Structures Act, 1998, requires amongst others municipalities to develop mechanisms to consult communities and community organisations in performing their functions and exercising their powers. These structures are commonly known as Ward Committees, and provide a vital link between Ward Councillors, the community and the municipality.
In the coming months Ward Committees will be elected to serve their communities and citizens must avail themselves to participate in these elections and to serve on these structures.
Cabinet welcomed the successful and peaceful municipal ward by-elections held recently in six provinces. South Africans have again demonstrated their commitment to political tolerance which is a testament to the maturity of our constitutional democracy.
2.5. The SA Sport Awards Ceremony 2016 will be held on 27 November 2016 at the Sand du Plessis Theatre, Mangaung, Free State. Voting lines for the People’s Choice Sports Star of the Year with its broadcast partner SABC Sport are open and will close on 27 November 2016 at 21h00. Cabinet commends all the People’s Choice Sports Star of the Year Nominees.
3. Cabinet’s position on issues in the environment
3.1. The impact of Climate Change is being felt through the severe weather conditions in the form of inconsistent rainfall, drought conditions, excessive heat and flash flooding. The flash floods in Gauteng and Mpumalanga resulted in the loss of lives, displaced communities especially in informal areas and destroyed infrastructure such as roads, bridges and property.
Cabinet conveys its condolences to the family and friends of those who lost their lives in the flooding and wishes those injured a speedy recovery. The nations thoughts and prayers are with those whose loved ones are still missing. The country’s Disaster Management teams remain on alert across the country, especially in areas where more rains are expected. All people must respect and respond to early warning of harsh weather.
President Jacob Zuma accompanied by Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen inspected the area and visited homes that were flooded at the Stjwetla informal settlement along the Jukskei River. President Zuma has directed an intergovernmental intervention led by Minister van Rooyen to harness the Jukskei River and buttress its banks to reduce the impact of flash floods on communities. Cabinet thanks Community based NGOs, Ward Councillors and volunteers who came to the aide of residents.
The recent rains should however not draw South Africans into a false sense of security as various parts of the country continue to experience drought conditions. Government has released water from the Sterkfontein Dam to Vaal Dam as a short term measure to help ease the situation and made an additional R212-million available in drought aid to support farmers in provinces that have been declared drought disaster areas.
Cabinet calls on South Africans to be conscious of the impact their actions have on the environment and do all they can to save water.
3.2. International ratings agencies Moody’s, Fitch and Standard and Poors will in the coming weeks announce their decision on the country’s investment rating grade. Government has been working with business, civil society and labour to translate the country’s plans into concrete actions that will ensure South Africa remains an investment grade country.
Cabinet calls on all sectors to join government in a united front to protect our country’s investment status.
3.3. The release of the 2015/16 audit results by the Auditor-General, Kimi Makwetu of national and provincial departments and their entities underscores the importance of performing the following basics properly and consistently: implementing plans to address deficiencies in financial controls based on commitments already made; providing effective leadership and monitoring achievement of performance targets; and reviewing and monitoring compliance with key laws and legislation over financial matters.
Audit outcomes of national auditees showed an overall improvement of 8 per cent, 30 per cent of the auditees had a clean audit status and 14 per cent were either outstanding, disclaimed or had adverse opinions.
The provincial level showed that the majority of departments had findings on compliance with key legislation and on the quality of their annual performance reports.
Cabinet noted with concern the risks and challenges as highlighted in the audit results. It has committed government to address the pressing issues that have been identified and strengthen financial controls towards better audit outcomes.
3.4. Cabinet welcomed the approximately 11 000 delegates who are participating at the 19th AfricaCom conference which is being held in Cape Town from 15 to 17 November 2016 under the theme “Harnessing the transformative power of Africa’s digital revolution: the internet as an engine for economic development and social empowerment”. The conference was addressed by Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services Dr Siyabonga Cwele and had over 350 speakers.
AfricaCom has become a broad platform in developing the digital economy in Africa for socio-economic development and empowerment in support of Africa’s Agenda 2063 programme. The conference attracts leaders of ICT, entrepreneurs and innovators from Africa and decision makers from over 140 countries. This year’s conference focused on digital skills development, empowering women in technology, technology to tackle disabilities and supporting the African Tech Start-up Ecosystem. This provided a vehicle to realise the objectives of the NDP in terms of digital transformation, economic development and social empowerment.
3.5. Cabinet is pleased that many students in higher education institutions across the country have responded positively to calls to save the 2016 academic programme. A number of institutions have started their final year examinations.
We encourage students to remain focused on completing their studies and allow the Commission into the Feasibility of Fee-Free Higher Education and Training to complete its work.
The work undertaken through NEDLAC is acknowledged, where the National Treasury presented proposals on how we could realise free education for tertiary students. A declaration will be finalised at the end of November 2016.
The call by national church leaders and other faith leaders for solutions to the challenges in higher education are most welcome. Their support in mediation, prayer and peace efforts, along with their call for the 2016 academic year to be successfully concluded are welcomed.
3.6. Cabinet welcomes the Constitutional Court decision on the Electronic National Traffic Information System (eNATIS) which will now be administered by government.
3.7. We also noted the Constitutional Court Ruling that the application by Terry Crawford-Browne, to have the arms deal commission set aside, was not in the interest of justice. The Seriti Commission of Inquiry that probed the 1999 multi-billion-rand deal found that there was no evidence that any of the contracts were tainted by evidence of corruption, fraud or irregularities, this report was released by President Jacob Zuma in April 2016.
3.8. Cabinet is concerned at the incitement of racial tensions and violence by public figures which detracts from our hard won freedom. South Africans must condemn detrimental influences such as the racist assault of Rethabile Mlotshwa which only serves to harm our fellow South Africans and does not add to the Ubuntu of our nation. We should also continue to respect the rule of law and speak out against unconstitutional calls to illegally occupy land in our communities.
3.9. Cabinet respects the resignation of Mr. Brian Molefe as Group Chief Executive of Eskom and wishes him well in his future endeavours. Mr. Molefe has been instrumental in developing Eskom’s turnaround strategy which is beginning to yield positive results. Cabinet is confident that he has left behind a strong executive team who will continue to deliver on Eskom’s mandate and implementation of the turnaround strategy.
3.10. Cabinet noted the allegations in an Al Jazeera documentary against Minister of State Security, Mr David Mahlobo, and noted that the South African Police Services are investigating the allegations.
3.11. Cabinet highlighted that government has been at the forefront in the fight against environmental crimes, this includes work done within the security services as part of government’s efforts to curb transnational organised crime and to ensure that justice prevails against those involved in syndicates.
Cabinet congratulated the following:
3.12. Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan who was recognised at the 2016 Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Awards by South Africa’s captains of industry. This acknowledgement by the business community signals that we are in this together, and that collectively we have the will to change South Africa into a better place. The collective efforts of government, business, labour and civil society is moving onto higher trajectory to realising Vision 2030 of the NDP.
3.13. Francois Groepe who was re-appointed as the Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, by President Jacob Zuma, for a period of five years with effect from 1 January 2017.
3.14. Gift of the Givers foundation founder Imtiaz Sooliman, who was awarded the Global Citizen Award by the international advisory firm Henley & Partners. This demonstrates that South African citizens are flying the flag high by giving so selflessly to people in need.
3.15. Executive Chef Martin Kobald, a culinary extraordinaire in South Africa, who has been elected as vice -president of the World Association of Chefs Societies.
3.16. Africa’s Greenest Hotel, Hotel Verde situated at Cape Town International Airport was voted the global winner in the Urban Accommodation category during the 15th annual Skål International Sustainable Tourism Awards, held in Monaco.
3.17. South African Sevens star Seabelo Senatla, who was named World Rugby Men's Sevens Player of the Year for his stellar performances in 2016. The South African flyer crossed for 66 tries in 10 events in the 2015-16 series - the second-highest in the 17-year history of the series, this is an inspiration to young rugby players. This is also the second year in a row that a South African has won the award.
3.18. South African gold medalist Wayde van Niekerk who was named male athlete of the Olympic Games by the Association of National Olympic Committee’s Awards which were held in Doha.
3.19. Brad Binder who capped off his title-winning Moto3 campaign with victory in the season finale at Valencia racing circuit in Spain.
3.20. Cabinet congratulated the Proteas on their Test series victory over Australia as well as Bafana Bafana with their victory over Senegal in a World-Cup qualifier match. Cabinet wishes the Springboks well in their match against Italy and is confident that the defeat by England only serves to strengthen the team.
Cabinet thanks all South Africans who once again united behind our national teams by watching the various matches and wearing the colours of our flag or the shirt of their favourite team. Let us continue to embrace and capture the sense of our national pride as our teams fly the country’s flag.
3.21. Cabinet joins President Jacob Zuma in congratulating Donald John Trump who was elected as the 45th President of the United States of America (USA) and is confident that future engagements between South Africa and the USA will be of benefit to both countries.

1. Implementation of Key Government Programmes
1.1. President Jacob Zuma led a South African Government delegation to the 36th Ordinary Southern African Development Community (SADC) Summit of Heads of State which took place from 30 to 31 August 2016 under the theme: “Resource Mobilisation for Investment in Sustainable Energy Infrastructure for an Inclusive SADC Industrialisation and for the Prosperity of the Region”.
The Summit focused on the need to improve both industrial and infrastructure development to enhance integration and foster intra-regional trade in addressing SADC’s sustainable development agenda.
On the political and security situation in the region, the focus was on constitutional, public and security sector reforms in the Kingdom of Lesotho, national reconciliation, implementation of the SADC Roadmap on Madagascar and the national dialogue towards preparations for national elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Cabinet joins President Jacob Zuma is extending gratitude to SADC Member States for the trust and confidence in electing South Africa as the incoming Chair of SADC in August 2017.
1.2. Cabinet welcomed the historic R11 billion investment by the Beijing Automobile International Corporation (BAIC) to establish an automotive manufacturing plant in the Coega Industrial Development Zone.
The deal is the biggest automotive investment in Africa in the last 40 years and reaffirms the country as a top investment destination for global automotive producers.
This was made possible through South Africa’s supportive policy environment, in particular the Automotive Production and Development Programme which has attracted automotive producers from across the world.
The BAIC investment is an outcome of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) that was held in Johannesburg in December 2015, where President Jacob Zuma and Chinese Prime Minister Xi Jinping signed no less than 26 bilateral agreements valued at approximately R100 billion.
The project positions the Eastern Cape as an automotive hub and has the potential of deepening the component supply chain, job creation and economic development. It is expected to create 2 500 jobs directly and more than 10 600 jobs indirectly.
Earlier this year Toyota announced that it would manufacture the new Toyota Hilux and Fortuner models as part of a R6.1 billion investment while BMW is to construct a R6 billion a state-of-the-art body shop.
These investments help advance our national priorities of reigniting economic growth, preserving existing and creating more jobs in the economy.
1.3. Cabinet welcomes the launch of the first Co-operative Financial Institution for Rural Women in Arts and Craft by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform, Gugile Nkwinti. The Mzansi Rural Arts and Craft Financial Institution Cooperative, which was registered earlier this year, will serve as a banking platform for rural crafters who are members of cooperatives that have been established in KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape, Limpopo and Mpumalanga.
The Institution allows these women access to the National Payment System, automated operations, accurate prudential reporting and will enable members to transact at point of sale, ATM and with other co-operative financial institutions across South Africa. Some of the key outcomes of the support provided include the acquisition of valid registration certificates, bank accounts, tax clearance certificates and linkages to new markets local and international markets. The initiative is part of a holistic effort to empower women in rural areas with skills and knowledge to create successful enterprises.
1.4. The launch of the 50/50 policy by Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform, has seen the first farm entering the pilot phase of the Policy Framework on Strengthening the Relative Rights of People Working the Land, in KwaZulu-Natal.
The 514 hectares Westcliffe farm comprises of 270 hectares of sugar cane, 140 hectares of timber and 10 hectares of irrigated cabbage operation. The agreement will see workers and farm owners become co-owners of the farming enterprise in uMshwathi local municipality, near Greytown.
Among other things, the policy aims to secure tenure for farm workers while seeking to transform land ownership patterns in the country and empowering workers to acquire shares in farming enterprises. The 50/50 policy framework also aims to improve economic transformation of the agricultural sector.
1.5. The 2016 Colloquium on Print Media Transformation which was hosted by the Department of Communications to discuss transformation and diversity in the country’s media provided a platform to a range of stakeholders active in the media environment to discuss the country’s media transformation, accountability and diversity priorities.
The colloquium, which focused on the entire value chain in the print media space, from ownership through to printing, distribution, research and advertising, will inform a concept paper related to the transformation and reform of traditional and new media in South Africa.
1.6. South Africa marks Tourism Month in September under the theme: “Tourism for All” to promote the country’s rich tourism offerings to all South Africans.

1.8. Cabinet was briefed on the 2016 Public Service Month during September under the theme “Public Services for the Inclusive Growth Matter: Taking Batho Pele to the next level in moving the Public Service Forward”.
This year’s Public Service Month also takes place mid-way through the fifth administration and a month after the local government elections. The month-long programme is an integral part of the Batho Pele Revitalisation Strategy which aims to rebuild good ethics, morale, pride and professionalism of government employees in the provision of public goods and services.
Public Service employees across government will use this month to engage and interact with citizens and other public stakeholders about the need for efficient delivery of services. This forms part of strengthening the implementation of the National Development Plan by contributing towards building a capable state that plays a developmental and transformative role.
1.9. Thusong Service Centre Annual Week from 19 to 23 September 2016 will be held under the theme “Thusong Service Centres – Moving the Public Service forward: We Belong, We Care, We Serve”.

2.1. Cabinet approved South Africa’s overarching approach for its participation in this year’s G20 which under the Chinese Presidency, adopted an overarching theme of working “Towards an Innovative, Invigorated, Interconnected and Inclusive World Economy”.
The primary focus of the G20 is to increase multilateral cooperation for the recovery of the global economy, to bring stability to the global financial system, to promote long-term sustainable growth and to strengthen global economic governance.
President Jacob Zuma will attend the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, China on 4 and 5 September 2016 hosted. South Africa’s participation in the G20 is to provide strategic foresight in establishing an economic and international policy platform that will drive and negotiate the best possible outcomes for South Africa, Africa and the developing world. The G20 Summit will, for the first time in history, have a record number of developing countries in attendance.
2.2. The release of the 2015/16 National Annual Crime Statistics, which are generated from crime data that are reported at station level was also approved and will be published on 2 September 2016.
The crime statistics are in important indicator of governments fight against crime in partnership with communities, labour and business. The statistics should be viewed within the context of population growth and economic circumstance.
2.3. Cabinet received a report on the Outcomes of the Twelfth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP12) which was held in Ankara, Turkey from 12 to 23 October 2015.
South Africa was identified as one of the beneficiaries of the UNCCD target setting support programme, which will assist countries to formulate it national voluntary targets in line with national circumstances and development priorities.
South Africa embraces the universality of the Convention and the need to serve all countries affected by desertification, land degradation and drought which will in turn ensure that such issues are taken care of wherever they happen both at national and global levels. This will ensure inclusivity and improve North-South relations and cooperation.
2.4. Cabinet approved the co-hosting of the 2nd World Breastfeeding Conference by the Department of Health and the International Baby Food Action Network, from 11 to 14 December 2016, under the theme “Let’s invest in creating an enabling environment for mothers and babies”.
This signals South Africa’s commitment to strengthen the call to protect, promote and support breastfeeding and further enhance the infant and young child nutrition agenda.
This contributes to achieving one of the nine long term health goals set out in the National Development Plan; reducing maternal, infant and child mortality. The Sustainable Development Goals also place emphasis on improving nutrition. The Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition, has one of six global targets for nutrition to increase the rates of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months to at least 50% by 2025.
This contributes to achieving one of the nine long term health goals set out in the National Development Plan; reducing maternal, infant and child mortality. The Sustainable Development Goals also place emphasis on improving nutrition. The Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition, has one of six global targets for nutrition to increase the rates of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months to at least 50% by 2025.
Breastfeeding is one of the best value investments in child survival. Sub-optimal breastfeeding practices contribute annually to 800 000 deaths (13% of all deaths) among under-five children in the developing world as well as to the high prevalence of malnutrition, which is a major public health challenge in Africa.
2.5. Cabinet approved for the Department of Health to host the 17th International Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities, from 27 November to 2 December 2016, in cooperation with the World Health Organisation (WHO). This reflects government’s commitment in addressing global health challenges on harmonisation of regulations and improve the safety, efficacy and quality of medicines and medical devices.
This consultative forum for medicine regulatory authorities of the 194 WHO member countries aims to address the regulation of medicines and medical devices and harmonisation of regulatory principles.
Hosting will strengthen the national medicines regulatory authority, the Medicines Control Council, and systems for medical products. Discussions will also contribute towards informing harmonisation and uplifting regulatory standards in Africa and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
It also gives recognition of South Africa as a global role-player in the regulatory oversight of medicines and related products. The country will have an opportunity to participate in the formulation of international drug policies that may become mandatory on WHO member countries.
2.6. Cabinet was also briefed on progress made on the implementation of the Public Administration Management Act, No 11 of 2014. This Act establishes a uniform system of public administration at all three spheres of government to promote and entrench the values and principles governing public administration as in section 195 (1) of the Constitution.
The Act provides for the establishment of two structures namely: (i) Office of Standards and Compliance and (ii) Technical Assistance Unit. A staggered implementation approach has been adopted to establish these.
The Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) compiled a first set of regulations which were gazetted for public comment on 15 July 2016. Collaboration is underway with the South African Bureau of Standards and other national setting bodies to develop a legal instrument which will lead to the operationalisation and establishment of the Office of Standards and Compliance.
DPSA is also in the process of investigating and developing a framework of norms and standards, including the establishment of the governance arrangements model that will allow for the implementation of the applicable norms.
2.7. Cabinet was briefed on a report on the asylum statistics for the period January to December 2015. Cabinet supported the establishment of a multi-departmental task team to discuss the process on managing final rejected asylum seekers.
The Report contributes to informed management of immigration so as to improve the management of asylum seekers and refugees.
According to information sourced from the National Immigration Information System, 62 159 new asylum seekers were registered, against 71 914 registered in 2014 and 70 010 in 2013. 60 640 registered asylum cases were adjudicated and finalised at the Refugee Status Determination level between January and December 2015. Of these adjudicated cases: 2 499 asylum cases were approved, 4 093 asylum cases were rejected as unfounded and 44 048 asylum cases were rejected as manifestly unfounded, abusive and fraudulent.
2.8. Cabinet was briefed on progress made with the Border Management Authority (BMA) Bill, 2016 which was approved for submission to Parliament on 23 September 2015. This Bill was originally submitted to Parliament on 8 October 2015. The socio-economic implications, of the envisaged establishment of the Border Management Authority, required that it also be submitted to NEDLAC, this was done on 13 October 2015.
There was an extensive NEDLAC consultations process on the Bill between November 2015 and May 2016. On 12 May 2016 a final NEDLAC report on the BMA Bill, 2016 was approved by the NEDLAC Management Committee. The Bill was certified on 18 May 2016 by the Office of the Chief State Law Advisor for introduction into Parliament. Cabinet noted that the BMA Bill, 2016 was subsequently introduced into Parliament on 25 May 2016 and the first deliberations on this Bill took place in Parliament on 6 August 2016.
Cabinet approved that the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) and the South African Revenue Service (SARS) fast-track the finalisation of the Memorandum of Understanding relating to the secondment of relevant SARS staff to DHA to support current border management and coordination efforts in the border environment.
3. Bills
3.1. Cabinet approved for the introduction of the Communal Property Associations Amendment Bill, 2016 to Parliament. The Bill amends the Communal Property Associations Act, 1996 (Act No 28 of 1996), by aligning it to the broader land reform mandate of the country.
It promotes democratic governance and sustainable use of communal land administered by communal property associations on behalf of communities. It strengthens the regulation of governance institutions and enhances state support to them. The Bill seeks to establish a Communal Property Associations Office that is headed by a Registrar of Communal Property Associations.
Communities will be better enabled to acquire, hold and manage properties through effective statutorily established community resource and allocation management and administration entities, supported by government.
3.2. The introduction of the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill, 2016 into Parliament which seeks to amend numerous laws having a bearing on the administration of justice in order to address practical and technical issues, to ensure the smooth administration of justice has also been approved.
The amendments are of such a nature that it is not practical to promote individual Amendment Acts to effect these amendments to the laws in question. The amendments are of a diverse nature and can be linked to the following key targets of the National Development Plan, namely to ensure that all people are and feel safe based on an independent and fair criminal justice system; social cohesion; to realise a developmental, capable and ethical state that treats citizens with dignity; and economic inclusion.
4. Upcoming events
4.1. President Jacob Zuma will lead South Africa’s delegation to the 71st United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 71) between 13 and 26 September in New York under the theme: "The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world."
This presents an opportunity for member states to take stock of the effectiveness of the United Nations, particularly as the organisation recently celebrated its 70th anniversary. Deliberations are expected on UN reform, including on the revitalisation of the UNGA; improvement of the work of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); and reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC) to expand its membership in both the permanent and non-permanent categories.
This will also be the last time that Ban Ki-moon addresses the UN General Assembly as its Secretary-General.
4.2. The South African Police Service (SAPS) will host the annual National Commemoration Day on 4 September 2016, to remember all members of the SAPS who lost their lives between the 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016, while performing their duties in an endeavour to ensure safety and security in South Africa.
5. Cabinet’s position on key issues in the environment
5.1. Cabinet expressed its concern over continued public spats between various parties on the matter related to the Hawks investigation into SARS-related issues. Cabinet called on all those concerned, including members of Cabinet acting in various capacities, to exercise restraint and cease making public statements directed at any protagonist in this matter. Cabinet calls on all parties to act with dignity and decorum and to respectfully approach the relevant parties instead of taking to public platforms.
5.2. Cabinet joins President Zuma in expressing full confidence in the Minister of Finance who, together with various other members of the Executive, business, Labour and civil society, has been doing a sterling job in building confidence in our economy among domestic and foreign investors. Cabinet equally called on all parties to respect and cooperate with state organs tasked with law enforcement.
5.3. The Executive continues to do all it can to protect the economy, and the important developmental work that state-owned entities are responsible for. All state agencies have a responsibility to carry out their mandate in a manner that does not destabilise the work of government or negatively affect the economy.
5.4. President Jacob Zuma attended the Sixth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD VI) Summit was held in Nairobi, Kenya from 27 to 28 August 2016. This was the first time that TICAD was held in Africa since its inception in 1993.
TICAD-VI afforded the Heads of State and Governments from Africa an important opportunity to monitor the progress and implementation of previous TICAD agreements which aim to speed up the growth and development of Africa.
TICAD-VI also took place in the first year of the implementation of the global and regional development agendas, namely the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063 and its First Ten-Year Implementation Plan. Being fully in line with these development agendas, TICAD-VI discussed thematic issues that Africa has been facing since the last TICAD-V in Yokohama, Japan in 2013. These include industrialisation, health, and social stability.
Cabinet welcomes Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s pledge that Japan will mobilise a total of $30 billion in private- and public-sector funds to invest in Africa over next three years to boost infrastructure building in Africa.
The assembly made extensive and deep discussions on private-sector investment, the industrialisation of economies in Africa, creating sustainable economic structures, health and prevention against pandemics such as Ebola and Zika, the fight against terrorism, educating and empowering poverty-stricken youths to prevent them from being lured to extremist groups and terrorism.
The heads of state and government reiterated their commitment to continue strengthening TICAD process with the guiding principles of open and inclusive forum, engagement of multi-stakeholders, alignment with African prior agendas, emphasis on people centered development, and effective implementation with integrated follow-up mechanisms.
5.5. The incidents of racism levelled against Pretoria High School for Girls are of concern. Cabinet commends the bravery of the learners for exposing the racism and prejudice at the school. They are indeed activists of social change, who are needed in taking our country away from its divisive past and closer to realising the objectives of a more united South Africa.
We call on all South Africans to respect each other and unite against the divisiveness of racism in our society. Our democratic journey is built on tolerance and respect.
5.6. We also join millions of South Africans in congratulating Team South Africa for a sterling performance at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. The team did the country proud by winning ten medals across various disciplines, including two gold medals. The blistering performance by Wayde Van Niekerk in winning gold in the 400m and smashing the world record, and the stunning run by our golden girl Caster Semenya in the 800m will live long in our collective memories.
5.7. Cabinet congratulates South Africans and the IEC for their part in ensuring yet another successful Local Government Election. Across the country, councils have met to elect mayors, speakers and chief whips in a resounding vote for democracy in action.
Cabinet encourages citizens to continue to participate through Ward Committees and other mechanisms that include communities in local government.
5.8. The announcement of a R1, 5 billion fine payable by ArcelorMittal, the country's largest steel-maker, for price-fixing and collusion in the steel industry is the largest single fine imposed against a single company by the competition authorities.
The company also undertook, as part of the settlement with the authorities, to invest R4,6 billion in new capital spending to upgrade its plants and improve competitiveness. The settlement further provides for a pricing mechanism that will cap the company's margin on flat steel products for a period of five years.
This is part of a crackdown against abuse of market power and price-fixing that undermines the performance of the economy, imposes unnecessary costs on downstream factories and damages local jobs. Government remains committed to promoting investment-led economic growth, not collusion-induced economic stagnation.
5.9. We call on all South Africans to use water efficiently and conserve it. By working together we can ensure a steady supply of water and also protect our vital water infrastructure.
There are persistent drought conditions in several parts of the country with Gauteng now being impacted with the Integrated Vaal River System under severe pressure.
To deal with the current situation, the Department of Water and Sanitation working with SALGA, CoGTA and municipalities will impose restrictions on water consumption in Ekurhuleni, Johannesburg, Tshwane and Mogale City.
Urban supply will be reduced by 15 per cent and water for irrigation will be reduced by 20 per cent. The restrictions are unavoidable and will remain in place to secure water supply until the situation eases.
5.10. The findings of the Mid-Year Population Estimates by Statistics SA showed South Africa’s population grew to 55.9 million people with life expectancy at 62 years and infant mortality estimated at 33.7 per 1 000 live births.
Cabinet was concerned over the increase in the HIV prevalence rate from 11.2 per cent last year to 12.7 per cent in 2016 translating into an estimated 7.03 million people living with HIV.
Cabinet appeals to all South Africans to work with government to prevent new infections by getting tested at least once a year, practising safer sex and for men and boys to heed the call and to consider medical circumcision.
5.11. Cabinet noted the Constitutional Court ruling on the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, which was enacted in 2014, to reopen the country’s land restitution process.
The Court gave Parliament two years to re-enact the law or to pass a new Act. The ruling means no new applications can be lodged until a new Act re-opening the lodgement of claims is passed.
The Commission on Restitution of Land Rights will be conducting a media briefing to guide the way forward following the ruling.
5.12. South Africa is hosting the 35th International Geological Congress at the Cape Town International Convention Centre from 27 August to 4 September 2016.
The Congress aims to contribute to the advancement of fundamental and applied research in the geological sciences. The event will showcase the region’s world-famous geology and geoheritage together with its geological and scenic sites. Geological challenges in the field will also be examined.
5.13. Cabinet conveys its condolences to the family and friends of the former Cabinet Minister and Premier of the Eastern Cape Province, Reverend Arnold Makhenkesi Stofile. Reverend Stofile was a veteran political activist who participated in all pillars of the South African struggle, from the underground and mass mobilisation drives, to international solidarity and the formal constitution of government structures.
Cabinet also expresses its condolences to the families of the South African National Defence Force members who lost their lives in the bus accident at Clarens in the Free State.
Cabinet joins President Jacob Zuma in sending condolences to H.E President Sergio Mattarella, the Government and the people of Italy following the earthquake that struck central Italy, which resulted in the deaths of citizens and extensive damage in several towns. We also wish the injured a speedy recovery.

Cabinet held its Lekgotla from 16 to 19 August 2016 at Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria.
The August 2016 Cabinet Lekgotla marked the halfway point of the Fifth Administration’s term of office.
Cabinet Lekgotla took time to congratulate South Africa for a peaceful, free and fair Local Government Election that took place on the 3rd of August 2016.
The Lekgotla took place in the context of a continuing sub-optimal economic outlook occasioned by various internal and external factors, as well as an ever-present threat to our sovereign credit ratings.
The Lekgotla provided an opportunity for Cabinet to collectively reflect on the implementation of Government’s programme of action and provided crucial lessons for a much nuanced and effective implementation of the National Development Plan, which underpins the Medium Term Strategic Framework 2014-2019.
Firm decisions were taken on concrete actionable plans which will take implementation of the Medium-Term Strategic Framework 2014-2019 and the Nine Point Plan to a higher level. These plans require all sectors, which includes government, civil society, business and labour, to roll up their sleeves and work together to ensure that together we take South Africa on a sustainable social development and economic growth trajectory.
Concrete plans have been put in place to deepen implementation in the next financial year, which also allows government to align its Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan.
The Cabinet Lekgotla focused on six key areas:
1. First, a global and domestic macro-economic analysis was deliberated on together with further proposals for economic and fiscal consolidation in the next year and beyond. This enabled Cabinet to locate its economic growth and fiscal decisions within the global economic context.
1.1. Global recovery is still expected to strengthen but to a lesser degree than previously estimated, as Brexit impacts unfavourably on global growth. Sub-Saharan Africa is reflecting challenging macroeconomic conditions as its major economies adjust to lower commodity process.
1.2. Other risks include potential vulnerability in the Euro banking system; financial stability in emerging markets, geopolitical risks, climatic and health risks.
1.3. The medium-term framework sustains social gains in a weakening economic environment. Government remains committed to meeting its medium-term fiscal targets and will take additional steps to do so as conditions warrant.
1.4. Future commitments of the state will depend on reforms that are based on effective governance, and with participation from the private-sector.
2. Second, the Cabinet Lekgotla Cabinet also reflected on the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan to grow the South African economy which was announced by President Jacob Zuma in his State of the Nation Address in February 2015.
2.1. The focus was on key programmes and projects to deepen the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan in the next financial year. This led to the adoption of key high-impact projects for the next financial year and beyond which aim to have a substantial positive impact on the economy through unlocking key levers.
2.2. Cabinet took strategic decisions to secure higher impact implementation of the Industrial Policy Action Plan including:
That the Department of Public Enterprises and National Treasury will consolidate procurement for locomotives into a single institution (Transnet) to ensure efficiency and compliance with the localisation requirements.
Finalising the evaluation of financial incentives for business to strengthen conditionalities and achieve greater value for money to enhance more inclusive growth.
A trade statistics architecture developed by the South African Reserve Bank, National Treasury, SARS and Stats SA will identify and hold illicit financial flows.
Introducing legislative amendments to implement the 30% set asides (a new Procurement Bill developed by National Treasury) by March 2017 and unlock the potential of SMME’s, cooperatives and the township and rural enterprises.
Implementing the new Preferential Procurement Regulations by end August 2016 as an interim measure to this radical intervention.
2.3. Government will continue to focus on labour-intensive sectors, including the need for various mechanisms to support greater impact on jobs, such as the use of our incentive programmes, amongst others: clothing, textiles, leather and footwear value-chain, agro-processing and business process services.
2.4. The successful Oceans Economy intervention will scale up projects to expand coastal and marine tourism in order to realise significant job creation.
2.5. To resolve the energy challenges in country, the Department of Energy will complete the Integrated Energy Plan and Integrated Resource Plan for Electricity by the end of 2016 to provide certainty on electricity pricing and investment in the generation capacity.
2.6. The Inter Ministerial Committee on Investment, Chaired by President Jacob Zuma will coordinate 40 priority investment projects across government. These 40 projects include the agro-processing and agri-parks, energy and infrastructure, manufacturing and services projects. These projects were selected based on having a high-scale economic impact linked to the Nine-Point Plan; being able to take-off within the next two years; and able to crowd-in further investment and community benefits.
2.7. Department of Trade and Industry will finalise the strategy for the deployment of locally developed technologies by the end of 2016. Further, the Department of Science and Technology and the National Treasury will secure additional funds to sustain and expand the Sector Innovation Fund through the Economic Competitive Support Package.
2.8. Priority continues to be placed on water saving and minimisation of water losses. By September 2016, agreements are to be completed with municipalities with high water losses, to facilitate placement of agents, and a clear funding model is to be completed.
2.9. In fast tracking the implementation of the South African Connect Strategy to connect schools, health facilities and government offices, the ICT Policy will be finalised and approved. A Broadband War Room will be established to accelerate implementation.
3. Thirdly, the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission (PICC) MANCO presented the Lekgotla with a high-level report on the implementation of the national infrastructure development programme as well as concrete infrastructure implementation plans in the next financial year and beyond. The work of the PICC is closely aligned to that of the Nine-Point Plan.
4. Fourthly, a summarised progress report on the implementation of the Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2014-2019 was presented, which concentrated on a review of key aspects of the MTSF 2014-2019 so as to improve implementation in the next financial year.
4.1. Whilst acknowledging the work done to date in the 9-Point Plan, it was also acknowledged that accelerated implementation is necessary to enhance economic growth.
4.2. An action plan to ensure greater expenditure on municipal infrastructure maintenance and to enforce proper financial asset management will be developed and implemented to extend the lifespan and quality of our infrastructure assets.
4.3. Cabinet resolved to initiate a national process towards the negotiation of a Social Compact between labour, business and government to stimulate economic growth and mitigate job losses.
5. Fifth, over and above the alignment of the MTEF to the Nine-Point Plan, the National Treasury and the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation presented their recommendations on work done in the past year to align the national budget to the National Development Plan as well as to the Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2014-2019.
5.1. Government has identified a set of budget priorities for 2017/18 which focusses on maintaining infrastructure spend, strengthening support for skills development and maintaining real levels of spending on the poor.
5.2. Work on identifying efficiencies and savings over the remainder of the MTEF will continue.
6. Sixth, the Lekgotla also reflected on progress made and the next steps in the reform of state-owned companies (SOCs) since the Cabinet Lekgotla of February 2015. This is in view of the important role played by SOCs in the radical socio-economic transformation advocated in the programme of the Fifth Administration.
6.1. The implementation of the stabilisation programme has progressed with varying degrees. Strengthening of leadership to execute the turnaround strategies remains critical.
6.2. Eskom has largely been stabilised with both operational and financial performance improving.
6.3. The Inter Ministerial Committee will continue to oversee thirteen (13) other SOC specific interventions.
6.4. The Lekgotla placed priority on the finalisation of the Shareholder Ownership Model, which will inform the legislative framework for SOC reform by November 2016.
6.5. Work will also start for the creation of the Presidential SOCs Coordinating Council which will provide President Zuma line of sight on strategic decisions and interventions to create SOCs that play a transformative role in a capable developmental state.
The decisions and plans from the Cabinet Lekgotla will bolster implementation of government’s programme of action and gives confidence that South Africa is on a sustainable social development and economic growth trajectory.
7. Special Official Funeral
7.1 Cabinet is saddened by the passing away of the former Minister of Sports and Recreation, Reverend Arnold Makhenkesi Stofile. As a veteran political activist, he participated in all pillars of government, at various provincial, national and international structures.
7.2 President Jacob Zuma declared that Reverend Stofile will be accorded a Special Official Funeral in terms of Category 2 of the State Official and Provincial Official Funeral Policy. As we remember this great leader of our country, the official memorial service for the late Rev. Stofile is being held today, 11am at the Abbotsford Christian Centre in East London. President Zuma ordered that the National Flag be flown at half-mast at all flag posts in the Republic of South Africa on the day of the funeral.
7.3 The late Rev. Stofile will be laid to rest at the funeral service taking place at University of Fort Hare where he was Chancellor, on Thursday 25 August 2016 in Alice, Eastern Cape Province. President Zuma will deliver the eulogy at the funeral of the late Reverend Stofile.
We convey our deepest condolences to his family and friends during this painful and difficult period.

Fellow South Africans,
Good evening, sanibonani, molweni, dumelang, goeie naand, lotshani, riperile, ndimadekwana,
Thank you Madam Speaker and Madam Chairperson for this opportunity to address the joint sitting of Parliament.
An illustrious son of our country, President Oliver Reginald Tambo, would have turned 100 years old this year, had he lived. This selfless patriot his adult life to a tireless pursuit of the liberation of our country and its people. He left a lasting legacy for all South Africans, and not only for his organisation, the ANC.
In his honour, we have declared the year 2017, the Year of Oliver Reginald Tambo. It is the year of unity in action by all South Africans as we move South Africa forward together. We have the pleasure to host members of the Tambo family this evening, Mr Dali Tambo with his wife Rachel, and their son Oliver Tambo Junior.
We also fondly remember Mama Africa, Miriam Makeba, who made history when she addressed the United Nations in 1963, appealing for action against the apartheid regime. We extend a warm welcome to her grand-daughter Zenzile Makeba Lee and great-grandson Lindelani.
Compatriots,
In this 23rd year of our freedom, our mission remains the quest for a united, democratic, non-sexist, non-racial and prosperous South Africa. Guided by the National Development Plan, we are building a South Africa that must be free from poverty, inequality and unemployment.
While the global economic environment remains uncertain, indications are that we have entered a period of recovery. We anticipate an economic growth rate of 1.3 per cent in 2017 following an estimated 0.5 per cent in 2016.
However, the economy is still not growing fast enough to create the jobs we need. There are some of our people, including youth, who have not worked for years.
It is for this reason that we decided to focus on a few key areas packaged as the Nine Point Plan to reignite growth so that the economy can create much-needed jobs.
The focus areas include industrialisation, mining and beneficiation, Agriculture and agro Processing, energy, SMMEs, managing work place conflict, attracting investments, growing the oceans economy and tourism.
We also added cross-cutting areas such as science and technology; Water and sanitation Infrastructure; Transport Infrastructure; and Broadband Rollout. I would like to provide a report back on the work done in some of these areas in the past year.
The interaction that we started last year between government, business and labour, known as the CEO Initiative, has been most helpful. We were able to address some domestic challenges together. We successfully avoided credit ratings downgrades which would have had significant impact on our economy.
Our labour market environment is also showing signs of stability, due to cooperation by social partners. The manner in which parties conducted and carried themselves during the wage negotiations in the platinum sector in particular, must be applauded.
Unity in action was also demonstrated again this week with the conclusion of the agreement on the National Minimum Wage and on measures to stabilise labour relations. This follows a call I had made in the State of the Nation Address on 14 June 2014.
We congratulate the Deputy President and the team at NEDLAC for this milestone and wish them well for work that still needs to be done.
Compatriots,
The extension of basic services to the people continued in the past year as we pursued a better life for all. To date nearly 7 million households have been connected to the grid and now have electricity.
The successful execution of the Eskom’s build and maintenance programmes helped ensure stability and an end to load-shedding.
Work is continuing to ensure energy security. Renewable energy forms an important part of our energy mix, which also includes electricity generation from gas, nuclear, solar, wind, hydro and coal.
Government is committed to the overall Independent Power Producers Programme and we are expanding the programme to other sources of energy including coal and gas, in addition to renewable energy.
Eskom will sign the outstanding power purchase agreements for renewable energy in line with the procured rounds.
Government is working hard to ensure reliable bulk water supply in the various areas of the country to support economic growth whilst increasing access to vulnerable and rural municipalities.
In an effort to curb the high water losses which in some municipalities far exceeds the national average which is currently at 37%; about ten thousand unemployed youth are being trained as plumbers, artisans and water agents. More will be recruited this year to reach the total of fifteen thousand. We call upon municipalities to support the War on Leaks programme.
We continue to build modern schools replacing mud structures and other inappropriate buildings through the Accelerated Schools Infrastructure delivery Initiative, (ASIDI). This gives our children dignity.
A total of one hundred and seventy three inappropriate structures have been eradicated since 2011. In total, 895 new schools now provide a conducive learning environment for our children.

President OR Tambo was a maths and science teacher. Government will thus prioritise maths and science more than ever before this year, in his memory. We are encouraged by recent international test results.
The results in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and the Southern and East African Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality show that the performance of South African learners is improving.
Amongst the participating countries, South Africa has shown the largest improvement of 87 points in Mathematics and 90 points in Science. This is very encouraging as we don’t want our children to be left behind.
Our investment in science and technology is yielding results. Since South Africa, supported by its eight African partners, won the bid to host the Square Kilometre Array telescope, significant progress has been made in building this mega science project and reaping its benefits.
Together with its precursor, the MeerKAT telescope, the SKA project continues to make important contributions to socio-economic development in South Africa.
Working closely with the industry, the Department of Science and Technology is implementing a technology localization strategy. This has ensured that the two billion rand MeerKAT telescope is constructed with seventy five percent local content.
On road infrastructure, Sanral has started with the planning phase of the 4.5 billion rand project to upgrade the current Moloto road. Sakha umgwaqo kanye nololiwe ku Moloto Road ukuze kuphephe izimpilo zabantu ngoba izingozi sezithathe imiphefumulo eminingi kuleyandawo.
During 2016, South Africa also signed a co-operation agreement with the People’s Republic of China to build the Moloto Rail Development Corridor.
In 2014 we launched the Operation Phakisa Big Fast results methodology in the ocean economy, health, education and mining sectors. The purpose was to find a few key projects where we could unlock growth in implementing the NDP.
All projects are proceeding well.
The South African Navy also participates in the Phakisa project and is preparing to host the government garage concept for all state-owned vessels in Simon’s Town, including the maintenance and repair of government-owned vessels, through the newly established South African Navy/ARMSCOR/Denel partnership.
We had identified tourism as a key job driver. We are thus pleased that our tourist arrival numbers for the period January to November 2016 increased to nine million, an increase of just over one million arrivals from 2015. This represents a thirteen percent growth in tourist arrivals.
Government runs effective poverty alleviation programmes such as the Expanded Public Works Programme. In addition, social grants now reach close to 17 million people, mainly older persons and children. Many families would not be able to put food on the table if it were not for social grants.
The Expanded Public Works Programme has since 2014, created more than two million work opportunities towards the attainment of the target of six million work opportunities by the end of March 2019. Of the work opportunities created, more than one million have been taken up by the youth.
During 2015/2016, more than sixty one thousand work opportunities were created through the Environmental Programmes such as Working for Water, Working for Wetlands, Working on Fire and Working for Ecosystems. More than 60% of the beneficiaries were young people.
Government working with society is fighting social ills that are tearing communities apart such as drugs and substance abuse. From Soshanguve to Rosettenville or KwaMashu to the Cape Flats, communities are in difficulty because of the drugs.
Other than law enforcement, the provision of treatment and prevention services is also critical.
The Department of Social Development is building new public treatment centres in provinces where there are no such facilities, in the Northern Cape, North West, Limpopo, Free State and the Eastern Cape.
Working together we will save our youth from drugs.
On health matters, the National Health Insurance is our flagship project that is aimed at moving South Africa towards Universal Health Coverage. The NHI will be implemented in a 14 year period in three phases. We are in the midst of the first phase which is the preparatory phase, which started in 2012.

We are deeply distressed by the death of so many psychiatric patients in Gauteng.
Mentally ill patients are some of the most vulnerable members of society, who need protection from the state itself and society as a whole. I have instructed the Minister of Health to ensure that the Health Ombudsperson’s recommendations are wholly and speedily implemented without any reservations.
We welcome the recommendation of the Health Ombudsperson that there is an urgent need to review the National Health Act 2003 and the Mental Health Act 2002 with a view that certain powers and functions revert back to the National Minister of Health.
Once more, we extend our heartfelt condolences to all families and relatives of the deceased. Government will provide support so that families do not face this burden alone. The Premier of Gauteng and the Minister of Health have already provided this assurance.
A lot more work has been done in the past year in implementing the Nine Point Plan and all our programmes. Ministers will report further on the programmes during the budget votes.
Honourable Members,
I would now like to speak on our priorities for the year ahead. Political freedom alone is incomplete without economic emancipation.
Oliver Tambo spoke clearly about this mission at an SACP anniversary meeting in London in 1981.
He said:
“The objective of our struggle in South Africa, as set out in the Freedom Charter, encompasses economic emancipation. It is inconceivable for liberation to have meaning without a return of the wealth of the country to the people as a whole.
“To allow the existing economic forces to retain their interests intact is to feed the roots of racial supremacy and exploitation, and does not represent even the shadow of liberation.
“It is therefore a fundamental feature of our strategy that victory must embrace more than formal political democracy; and our drive towards national emancipation must include economic emancipation.”
What do we mean by radical socio-economic transformation?
We mean fundamental change in the structure, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership, management and control of the economy in favour of all South Africans, especially the poor, the majority of whom are African and female, as defined by the governing party which makes policy for the democratic government.
Twenty two years into our freedom and democracy, the majority of black people are still economically disempowered. They are dissatisfied with the economic gains from liberation.
The gap between the annual average household incomes of African-headed households and their white counterparts remains shockingly huge. White households earn at least five times more than black households, according to Statistics SA.
The situation with regards to the ownership of the economy also mirrors that of household incomes. Only ten percent of the top one hundred companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are owned by black South Africans, directly-achieved principally, through the black empowerment codes, according to the National Empowerment Fund.
The pace of transformation in the workplace, the implementation of affirmative action policies as required by the Employment Equity Act, also remains very slow.
In terms of the 2015/16 information submitted to the Employment Equity Commission, the representation of whites at top management level amounted to 72 percent whilst African representation was at 10 percent.
The representation of Coloureds stood at 4.5% and Indians 8.7%.
The report further provides that white South Africans, in particular males, are afforded higher levels of recruitment, promotion and training opportunities as compared, to the designated groups.
At the level of gender at senior management level, males remain dominant at 67.6% and females at 32.4% percent.
The skewed nature of ownership and leadership patterns needs to be corrected. There can be no sustainability in any economy if the majority is excluded in this manner. In my discussions with the business community, they accepted these transformation imperatives.
Today we are starting a new chapter of radical socio-economic transformation. We are saying that we should move beyond words, to practical programmes.
The state will play a role in the economy to drive that transformation. In this regard, Government will utilise to the maximum, the strategic levers that are available to the state.
This includes legislation, regulations, licensing, budget and procurement as well as Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Charters to influence the behaviour of the private sector and drive transformation.
The State spends five hundred billion rand a year buying goods and services. Added to this is the nine hundred billion rand infrastructure budget. Those budgets must be used to achieve economic transformation.
As a start, the new regulations making it compulsory for big contractors to subcontract 30 percent of business to black owned enterprises have been finalised and were gazetted on the 20th of January.
Through such regulations and programmes, government will be able to use the state buying power to empower small enterprises, rural and township enterprises, designated groups and to promote local industrial development.
Two key challenges we face is the high levels of concentration in the economy as well as the collusion and cartels, which squeeze out small players and hamper the entry of young entrepreneurs and black industrialists.
The competition authorities have done excellent work to uncover the cartels and punish them for breaking the law.
Last year I signed into law a provision to criminalize the cartels and collusion and it came into effect on 1 May. It carries jail sentences of up to 10 years.
We are now stepping up our actions to deal with the other challenge, namely economic concentration, where a small grouping controls most of a market.
During this year, the Department of Economic Development will bring legislation to Cabinet that will seek to amend the Competition Act. It will among others address the need to have a more inclusive economy and to de-concentrate the high levels of ownership and control we see in many sectors. We will then table the legislation for consideration by parliament.
In this way, we seek to open up the economy to new players, give black South Africans opportunities in the economy and indeed help to make the economy more dynamic, competitive and inclusive. This is our vision of radical economic transformation.
Compatriots,
Government is actively involved in the property sector, having provided more than four million houses since 1994.
This sector in our country is valued at approximately seven trillion rand, with the subsidised sector being valued at one point five trillion rand.
However, less than five percent of the sector is owned or managed by Black people and Africans in particular. A draft Property Practitioners Bill will be published by the Department of Human Settlements for public comment with the purpose of establishing a more inclusive, representative sector, towards radical economic transformation.
Among key priorities this year, Government will also address the increasing delays and backlogs in registration and issuing of title deeds to beneficiaries of housing projects funded by the capital subsidy.
Compatriots,
We reiterate that radical economic transformation should mean moving beyond share ownership schemes only. We would like to see black people involved directly in business, owning factories. The development of the Black Industrialists programme is thus critical.
The programme has from inception supported more than 22 entrepreneurs. Government has further opportunities in the property maintenance projects of the Department of Public Works.
The Department will invest approximately one hundred million rand this year on critical capital and maintenance programmes to modernise harbours. They will also continue generating revenue from letting state owned harbours and coastline properties, which will benefit black owned SMMEs.
Government will also continue to pursue policies that seek to broaden the participation of black people and SMMEs, including those owned by women and the youth, in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector.
We assure the youth that the lowering of the cost of data is uppermost in our policies and plans.
Compatriots,
Mining has always been the backbone of our economy and an important foreign exchange earner. We welcome the recovery in commodity prices which has resulted in an upswing in mining output. This augurs well for the industry.
The Mining Charter is currently being reviewed. The Charter seeks to recognise the internationally accepted right of the state to exercise sovereignty over all the mineral and petroleum resources within the Republic.
It is also aimed at helping the country to de-racialise the ownership of the mining industry. This will help ensure the sustainability of this industry. We trust that discussions between government and business on the Charter will yield results so that the process can be finalised.
We will continue to pursue direct state involvement in mining. The Mining Company of South Africa Bill will be presented to Cabinet and Parliament during the year.
The Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Amendment Bill was sent back to Parliament so that issues relating to the public consultation process undertaken by Provincial legislatures can be addressed.
We trust that it shall be processed and returned for finalization without much delay so that the concerns relating to uncertainty raised by business can be resolved.
Government continues to work with other stakeholders to combat illegal mining to save lives and to prevent the trafficking of precious metals and diamonds.
We also continue to place great emphasis on the health and safety of mineworkers which is so crucial to the sustainability of the mining sector. Working with the mining companies we can ensure that lives are protected at all times.
The tragic accident that occurred at Lily Mine outside in Mpumalanga earlier in 2015 is the first of its kind that we have experienced since the dawn of democracy. The families are going through immense pain and frustration.
Compatriots,
It will be difficult if not impossible, to achieve true reconciliation until the land question is resolved. Only eight million hectares of arable land have been transferred to black people, which is only 9.8 percent of the 82 million hectares of arable land in South Africa.
There has also been a 19 percent decline in households involved in agriculture from 2,9million in 2011 to 2,3 million households in 2016.
We trust that Parliament will be able to move with speed in meeting the requirements so that the law can be finalised to effect transformation.
The reopening of land claims is also still on hold because the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, 2014 was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court.
The Constitutional Court found that the public consultation process facilitated by the National Council of Provinces and some Provincial Legislatures, did not meet the standard set in the Constitution.
Going forward, government will continue to implement other programmes such as the Strengthening of Relatives Rights programme, also known as the 50-50 programme.
In this programme, the farm workers join together into a legal entity and together with the farm owner a new company is established and the workers and the owner become joint owners.
To date 13 proposals have already been approved benefiting 921 farm dweller households at a value of R631 million. We applaud farmers and farm workers for this innovation.
Government has committed itself to support black smallholder farmers. I received a memorandum from the African Farmers Association of South Africa who say the year 2017 must be the year of the commercialisation of the black small holder farmers.
Indeed, Government will implement a commercialisation support programme for 450 black smallholder farmers.
We encourage more women to consider farming. I have as a special guest today, the 2016 Female Farmer of the Year, Ms Vanecia Janse from Koukamma municipality in the Eastern Cape.
Compatriots,
Our farmers went through a difficult period last year because of the drought. To date, an estimated amount of 2.5 billion rand was made available for the provision of livestock feed, water infrastructure, drilling, equipping and refurbishment of boreholes, auction sales and other interventions.
Furthermore, the Industrial Development Corporation and the Land Bank availed funding of about five hundred million rand to distressed farmers to manage their credit facilities and support with soft loans.

President OR Tambo was a champion of women’s rights.
We will continue to mainstream the empowerment of women in all government programmes.
Government will continue to prioritise women’s access to economic opportunities and, in particular, to business financing and credit.
This is the freedom that heroines of the struggle such as the late Dora Tamana of Gugulethu here in Cape Town fought for. I am pleased to have her son Mongezi Tamana as a guest today.
Compatriots,
In December 2015 university students voiced their concerns about the cost of higher education. They correctly pointed out that accumulated debt and fast rising fees were making it harder and harder for those who come from less-privileged households to enter and stay within the education system until they complete their studies.
At the time of tabling the 2016 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, our government announced additional measures aimed at making higher education accessible to more students from working class families.
Government has provided funds to ensure that no student whose combined family income is up to six hundred thousand rand per annum will face fee increases at universities and TVET colleges for 2017.
We are ensuring that our deserving students can study without fearing that past debts will prevent them from finishing their studies.
In the remaining years of this administration, our policies will respond directly to the following concerns that the students have placed firmly on the table:
Firstly, the students have expressed concern that the NSFAS threshold of one hundred and twenty two thousand rand is too low. We will have to look into this matter with the view to raising the threshold on a phased basis in the period ahead.
Secondly, the students have pointed out that the full cost of study at some universities is higher than the subsidy that NSFAS provides. As a result, NSFAS students who study at some universities that charge higher fees end up accumulating debt. Our government-initiated processes are already looking at this issue too.
Honourable Members and Fellow South Africans, students and their parents should understand that the needs for services like water, sanitation, early childhood development and good public transport have to also be addressed, alongside access to quality higher education and training.
But our commitment to finding sustainable solutions to the funding of the social wage in general, and education, in particular, is unwavering.
As the processes that we have set in motion draw to a close, such as the Heher Commission, the Ministerial Task Team, broader engagements with students, university and TVETS leadership and civil society, we will find resources to give expression to our policies.
I invite all stakeholders to participate in the processes that are under way so that no view is not heard.
No great idea should be excluded. As soon as the broadest sections of our society agree on what to do, our government will take steps to reprioritise resources to implement it on a phased basis.
Let us engage to identify the most pressing needs, and allocate our limited resources accordingly. Let us build our self-reliance and move forward in the spirit of unity.

The fight against crime is an apex priority. The police will increase visible policing, building on the successful pattern of deployments utilised during the Safer Festive Season Campaign.
They will also utilise certain specialized capabilities, such as the Tactical Response Teams and National Intervention Units, to assist in addressing problematic high-crime areas.
We received a message from Soshanguve last week that crime is rife in Block L and that hijackings and robberies are high. It is such communities that need to build stronger partnerships with the police to ensure that criminals do not prey on residents.
Other measures to fight crime nationally will include the establishment of Specialised Units, focusing on drug-related crime, taxi violence and firearms and the enhanced utilisation of investigative aids such as forensic leads.
The Police will also enhance the utilisation of the DNA Database in the identification of suspects. We urge the public to work with the police to ensure safer communities.
Compatriots,
We welcome the decline in Rhino poaching incidents since October 2015 which is for the first time in a decade. This arises from intensive joint operations by law enforcement agencies.
Compatriots,
One of the strategies of fighting crime is to ensure that those who are released from prison do not commit crime again.
The Department of Correctional Services continues to work hard to turn prisons into correctional centres through offering various services. As a result, compliance levels with parole and probation conditions have improved to reach a historic mark of 98 percent.
The country has also made good progress in reducing the numbers of children in correctional centres.

The promotion of access to justice was given added meaning last year when the High Court Division in Limpopo was opened in November.
The Mpumalanga High Court will be completed during this financial year. The coming into operation of these two high courts means that we have now realised the goal of a High Court in every province of the country.

The fight against corruption continues. Within the National Prosecuting Authority, the Asset Forfeiture Unit completed three hundred and eighty nine forfeiture cases to the value of three hundred and forty nine million rand.
They obtained three hundred and twenty six freezing orders to the value of seven hundred and seventy nine million rand.
A total of 13 million rand was recovered in cases where government officials were involved in corruption and other related offences in the past year.

Oliver Tambo set the tone for the country’s foreign policy as early as 1977 when addressing the first Congress of the Angolan ruling party MPLA that:
“We seek to live in peace with our neighbours and the peoples of the world in conditions of equality, mutual respect and equal advantage”.
South Africa is honoured to chair the Southern African Development Community (SADC) starting from August 2017. We will utilise our tenure to fast-track the implementation of the SADC Industrial Strategy.
We are accelerating the integration agenda through the implementation of SADC-COMESA-East African Community Free Trade Area.
We will continue with our involvement in our mediation efforts, peacekeeping operations, and peace-making initiatives in Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Mozambique, South Sudan, Somalia and Libya. The SANDF represents the country well in the peacekeeping missions.
Furthermore, trade with our traditional partners in the west remains a significant contributor to our economy. We will continue to partner with the United States and work together on issues of mutual interest such as the full renewal of AGOA.
We value our relationship with the People’s Republic of China. China is one of South Africa's most important and key strategic partners. We recognise the PRC 'as the sole Government and Authority representing the whole of China'.
South Africa reiterates its position and commitment to the 'One China Policy' and we consider Taiwan as an integral part of the PRC. At continental partnership level, the Joint Africa-EU Strategy remains an important long-term framework for continued cooperation.
The Economic Partnership agreement with the EU came into force in September 2016 thus providing new market access opportunities for South African products. Almost all South African products, about 99% will have preferential market access in the EU. About 96% of the products will enter the EU market without being subjected to customs duties or quantitative restrictions.
The Southern African Customs Union Mercosur Preferential Trade Agreement has also entered into force, providing preferential access to over one thousand tariff lines. This is an agreement that promotes South-South trade.
Our cooperative partnerships with other regions are bearing fruits. The BRICS New Development Bank has recorded encouraging progress. We welcome the Goa BRICS Heads of State and Government decision to establish the BRICS Rating Agency so that we can assist each other in assessing our economic paths.
We are also pleased with agreements with our BRICS partners in the field of agriculture. We will implement off take agreements on the export of pulses, mangos and pork to India.
We will also export twenty thousand tons of beef to China per year for a period of 10 years. We will continue to pursue the reform of the international system because the current configuration undermines the ability of developing countries to contribute and benefit meaningfully.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the occupation of Palestine. The expansion of Israeli settlements undermines global efforts aimed at realising the two state solution and the Oslo accord. We wish to reiterate our support for the Palestinian course.
Similarly, we hope that the readmission of Morocco to the AU should serve as a catalyst to resolve the Western Sahara issue.
Let me add that South Africa will use Armed Forces Day on 21 February, 2017, to mark the Centenary commemorations of the tragic sinking of the SS Mendi which left 646 soldiers dead in 1917.

The Constitution accords equal rights and dignity to all South Africans. The United Nations proclaimed 13 June as International Albinism Awareness Day. We should use this day to raise awareness and eliminate the discrimination or harm that compatriots with albinism are subjected to in some areas.

Fellow South Africans,
Good evening, sanibonani, molweni, riperile, dumelang, lotjhani, goeienaand, ndi madekwana, !gai//goes.
I would like to thank the Presiding Officers for the opportunity to address the nation this evening.
The year 2015 marks 60 years of a historic moment in our history, when South Africans from all walks of life adopted the Freedom Charter in 1955, in Kliptown, Soweto.
They declared amongst other things, that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of all the people.
That was a powerful, visionary and reconciliatory statement which set the tone for the non-racial democracy we have established.
This week we also mark 25 years since the release of President Nelson Mandela from prison, and since the unbanning of liberation movements.
The release of Madiba marked a giant leap in the long walk to freedom for the people of South Africa as a whole and dealt a fatal blow to apartheid colonialism.
We continue to be inspired by Madiba and draw lessons from his legacy as we build our country.

The year 2015 is the Year of the Freedom Charter and Unity in Action to Advance Economic Freedom. It is the year of going the extra mile in building a united, democratic, non-racial, non-sexist and prosperous South Africa.
It is also the year of rededicating ourselves to eradicate racism and all related intolerances in our country.
It is also the year of investing more in our future, by educating our children and the youth about the rich heritage of this country.
We are already inculcating a new national identity through promoting national symbols such as the national flag, the national anthem and the preamble of the Constitution in every school.
From this year, schools must also practice the African Union anthem, in preparation for the celebration of Africa Month in May, as we implement the African Union decision in this regard.
Honourable members,
Distinguished guests,
Our youth is our future and their success fills us with immense pride. I would like you to join me in congratulating my special guest, our ace Olympic swimmer Chad Le Clos. Chad received swimming’s highest honour in December after he was crowned the world’s best swimmer for 2014, by the International Swimming Federation, amongst many other outstanding achievements.
I am also hosting three special girls from Moletsane High School in Soweto. They are Ofentse Mahasha, Hlengiwe Moletsane and Tiisetso Mashiloane. Ofentse and Hlengiwe attended the last G20 summit in Australia and performed exceptionally well, making us truly proud.
Allow me also Madam Speaker and Chairperson to congratulate in absentia, another star performer who has brought glory to our country, Miss World, Ms Rolene Strauss.
I would also like to introduce another special guest, the country’s Sports Star of the Year and Banyana Banyana striker, Miss Portia Modise. Congratulations Portia.
Honourable Members,
Distinguished guests,
I would like to thank all who took their time to contribute to SoNA 2015. In terms of the inputs, our people are concerned about amongst others crime, roads, access to education, youth internship schemes, water, electricity and support for small businesses.
Contributions requiring feedback are being referred to government departments for action.
Honourable Members,
Distinguished guests,
We meet yet again during a difficult economic climate. This week the International Monetary Fund revised down to 3,5%, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecasts for global economic growth in 2015.
Our ambition of achieving a growth target of 5% by 2019 is at risk, because of the slow global growth as well as domestic constraints in energy, skills, transport and logistics amongst others.
However, the situation is more promising on the jobs front. Two days ago, Statistics South Africa released the employment figures for the last quarter of 2014. The report shows that there are now 15,3 million people who are employed in South Africa. Jobs grew by 203 000.
Our investment in youth employment is also paying off. The Employment Tax Incentive which was introduced last year directed mainly at the youth, is progressing very well.
R2 billion has been claimed to date by some 29 000 employers, who have claimed for at least 270 000 young people.
I announced a target of six million work opportunities over five years last year for the programme.
We have thus far created more than 850 000 work opportunities. This means that we are poised to meet the annual target of one million job opportunities.
In addition, our environmental programmes such as Working on Waste, Working for Wetlands, Working for Water and Working on Fire have created more than 30 000 work opportunities and aim to create more than 60 000 during the next financial year.
Compatriots,
Our economy needs a major push forward. We would like to share with you our nine point plan to ignite growth and create jobs.
These are:
Resolving the energy challenge.
Revitalising agriculture and the agro-processing value chain.
Advancing beneficiation or adding value to our mineral wealth.
More effective implementation of a higher impact Industrial Policy Action Plan.
Encouraging private sector investment.
Moderating workplace conflict.
Unlocking the potential of small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs), cooperatives, township and rural enterprises.
State reform and boosting the role of state owned companies, information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure or broadband roll-out, water, sanitation and transport infrastructure as well as
Operation Phakisa aimed growing the ocean economy and other sectors.
Compatriots,
The country is currently experiencing serious energy constraints which are an impediment to economic growth and is a major inconvenience to everyone in the country.
Overcoming the challenge is uppermost in our programme. We are doing everything we can to resolve the energy challenge.
Bakwethu,
Uhulumeni wenza konke okusemandleni akhe ukubhekana nesimo sokuncipha kukagesi ezweni. Siyazi ukuthi lesi isikhathi esinzima, kodwa sizodlula, ngoba sinezindlela yokusebenza loludaba.
(Compatriots,
Government is doing everything within its power to deal with the problem of energy shortage in the country. We are quite aware of the fact that this is indeed a difficult period, but it shall pass because we do have strategies in place to deal with this matter.)
We have developed a plan which involves both short, medium-term and long-term responses.
The short and medium-term plan involves improved maintenance of Eskom power stations, enhancing the electricity generation capacity and managing the electricity demand. The long-term plan involves finalising our long-term energy security master plan.
As a priority we are going to stabilise Eskom’s finances to enable the utility to manage the current period. In this regard, government will honour its commitment to give Eskom around R23 billion in the next fiscal year.
The 'War Room' established by Cabinet in December is working diligently around the clock with Eskom, to stabilise the electricity supply system and contain the load shedding. During this period, we have to work together to find solutions.
We urge all individuals, households, industries and government departments to save electricity in order to reduce the need for load shedding. The Department of Public Works has been instructed to ensure that all government-owned buildings are energy efficient.
Given the high cost of diesel, Eskom has been directed to switch from diesel to gas as a source of energy for the utility’s generators.
Households are also being encouraged to switch from electricity to gas for cooking, heating and other uses.
The construction of the three new power stations - Kusile, Medupi and Ingula - will add 10 000 megawatts of capacity to the national grid. The quest for alternative energy sources is also ongoing.
To date government has procured 4 000 megawatts from Independent Power Producers, using renewable sources. The first three bid windows of the renewable energy procurement process attracted more than R140 billion from private investors.
A total of 3 900 megawatts of renewable energy has also been sourced, with 32 projects with a capacity of just over 1 500 megawatts completed and connected to the grid.
Eskom itself has completed the construction of the Sere Wind Farm, which is already delivering 100 megawatts to the grid, well ahead of its intended launch in March this year.
Government also began procurement in December 2014, of 2 400 megawatts of new coal-fired power generation capacity, from Independent Power Producers. The procurement process for 2 400 megawatts of new gas-fired generation will commence in the first quarter of the new financial year.
A total of 2 600 megawatts of hydro-electric capacity will be sourced from the SADC region. With regards to the long-term energy master plan, we will pursue gas, petroleum, nuclear, hydropower and other sources as part of the energy mix.
South Africa is surrounded by gas-rich countries, while we have discovered shale gas deposits in our own Karoo region.
The Operation Phakisa Ocean Economy initiative, launched last year, also promises to unveil more oil and gas resources, which will be a game changer for our country and region.
Government is also exploring the procurement of the 9 600 megawatts nuclear build programme as approved in the Integrated Resource Plan 2010-2030.
To date government has signed inter-governmental agreements and carried out vendor parade workshops in which five countries came to present their proposals on nuclear.
These include the United States of America, South Korea, Russia, France and China.
All these countries will be engaged in a fair, transparent, and competitive procurement process to select a strategic partner or partners to undertake the nuclear build programme.
Our target is to connect the first unit to the grid by 2023, just in time for Eskom to retire part of its aging power plants.
With regards to hydro power, the Grand Inga Hydro-electrical Project partnership with the Democratic Republic of Congo will generate over 48 000 megawatts of clean hydro-electricity. South Africa will have access to over 15 000 megawatts.
For sustainability, government will establish strategic partnerships for skills development with the countries that will partner us in the Energy Build Programme, while also generating skills locally.
Compatriots,
There are still 3,4 million households in the country without electricity. In the June 2014 SoNA, I announced that infrastructure support will be given to specific municipalities in the country.
Funding has been provided for electrification to the following municipalities in the 2015/16 financial year: Amathole District Municipality, Umzinyathi District Municipality, Alfred Nzo District Municipality, Lukhanji Municipality and OR Tambo District Municipality.
Fellow South Africans,
While tackling the energy challenges in our country we also need to fight copper cable and metal theft. Government will introduce tougher measures to deal with this serious crime.

During this year of the 60th anniversary of the Freedom Charter, land has become one of the most critical factors in achieving redress for the wrongs of the past.
Last year, we reopened the second window of opportunity for the lodgement of land claims. More than 36 000 land claims have been lodged nationally and the cut-off date is 2019. We are also exploring the 50/50 policy framework, which proposes relative rights for people who live and work on farms. Fifty (50) farming enterprises will be identified as a pilot project.
In terms of our new proposed laws, a ceiling of land ownership will be set at a maximum of 12 000 hectares (ha). Foreign nationals will not be allowed to own land in South Africa but will be eligible for long-term lease.
In this regard, the Regulation of Land Holdings Bill will be submitted to Parliament this year. Through the Land Reform Programme, more than 90 000 ha of land have been allocated to small holder farmers, farm dwellers and labour tenants.
The process of establishing the Office of the Valuer-General is underway, which is established in terms of the Property Valuation Act. Once implemented the law will stop the reliance on the Willing Buyer-Willing Seller method in respect of land acquisition by the State.
Compatriots,
Agriculture is a catalyst for growth and food security. We are working with the private sector to develop an Agricultural Policy Action Plan which will bring one million ha of under-utilised land into full production over the next three years.
Among key interventions this year, we will promote the establishment of agri-parks or cooperatives and clusters in each of the 27 poorest district municipalities to transform rural economies. An initial funding of R2 billion has been made available for the agri-park initiative.
We will further enhance our agro-processing exports which have been growing rapidly especially to new markets in Africa and China. For example, we have concluded agricultural trade protocols for the export of South African maize and apples to China.
The export of apples alone is projected to generate R500 million in foreign exchange over three years.
A good story to tell in agriculture is the success of some of our emerging farmers and smallholders.
In the Vhembe District Municipality in Musina, the Limpopo Government has supported the Nwanedi Cluster comprising 300 farmers growing vegetables on just over 1 300 ha for commercial purposes.
The cluster has already created more than 2 500 jobs as vegetable farming is highly labour-intensive.
We are happy to have in our midst today, the winner of the 2014 Agriculture Top Female Entrepreneur Award, Ms Nokwanele Mzamo, from Kirkwood in the Eastern Cape.
Madam Speaker and Madam Chairperson,
Our interventions to support the manufacturing sector are bearing fruit. Our Automotive Investment Scheme has unlocked private-sector investment of R24,5 billion, and generated exports of automotives and components of R103 billion in 2013.
We have built a world-class auto sector on the African continent exporting to over 152 countries. The leather and footwear sector has also grown to 60 million pairs of shoes, and exports grew by 18% with significant benefit to the balance of trade.
The United Nations (UN) Conference on Trade and Development shows that South Africa doubled its Foreign Direct Investment inflows to R88 billion in 2013 while 2014 projections are also positive.
The manufacturing sector was hit hard by the global financial crisis. Government committed more than R2,8 billion to companies in the sector, through the Manufacturing Competitiveness Enhancement Programme.
We are very pleased with the response of our manufacturers who, committed over R12,4 billion in private-sector investment. It is a very good story to tell indeed. In addition, to advance transformation, we have introduced the programme to find and develop black industrialists over three years.
Compatriots,
Given such success in manufacturing, we are poised to make progress in our quest to ignite growth.
Madam Speaker and Madam Chairperson,
To attract foreign skills for our growing economy, we will invite dialogue with various stakeholders on the Migration Policy.
We will also prioritise the review of visa regulations to strike a balance between national security and growth in tourism.
Compatriots and friends,
In the June 2014 SoNA, I spoke about the need to stabilise the mining sector and to promote a stable labour environment.
We had been concerned then, about the spate of long and sometimes violent strikes.
The implementation of a number of programmes under the Framework Agreement for a Sustainable Mining Industry has caused relative stability and optimism in the mining sector, which is the backbone of our economy.
Mine Crime Combating Forums have been established in the North West, Limpopo, Free State, Mpumalanga, and Gauteng provinces.
Government will implement the agreements reached with business and labour, including the consideration of a national minimum wage.
We had also made a commitment in last year’s SoNA to revitalise distressed mining towns and a lot of progress has been made.
A total of R2.1 billion has been ring-fenced for this purpose with R290 million approved for informal settlement upgrading in Mpumalanga, North West, Gauteng, Northern Cape, Limpopo and the Free State.
One hundred and thirty three (133) informal settlements are being assessed or prepared for upgrading through the National Upgrade Support Programme.
Thirty two (32) settlements are being upgraded and 87 housing projects are being implemented across the prioritised mining towns.
Importantly, government, the mining sector and the Banking Association of South Africa signed a social contract for the development of sustainable human settlements.
Government also continues to provide social development support within mining communities. Other support includes technical expertise with regard to Integrated Development Plans and the development of Special Economic Zones.
The mining towns are also being assisted with implementing the ‘Back to Basics’ municipal service delivery strategy. Indeed a lot is being done to build our mining towns.
Government is also reviewing the compliance of mining companies with the 2014 Mining Charter targets.
I referred the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act back to Parliament to enable the correction of some constitutional shortcomings and others issues.
Compatriots
Responding to business requests, government has synchronised environmental impact assessments, water and mining rights applications and has set a maximum of 300 days for all of these authorisations to be issued.
In addition, we will also establish a one-stop inter-departmental clearing house to attend to investor complaints and problems.
Fellow South Africans,
The year 2015 will see further improvements in labour legislation to further promote worker rights.
The Labour Department will review the sectoral determinations of agriculture, forestry, private security, wholesale and retail sectors.
We expect the finalisation of the Employment Services Act of 2014 which formally establishes a public employment service.
The legislation also formally regulates the practices of private employment agencies and temporary employment services, to prevent the abuse of unsuspecting work seekers.
In addition, the Unemployment Insurance Act of 2001 will be amended to improve benefits to beneficiaries and include public servants in the application of the Act.
Honourable members and distinguished guests,
Small business is big business.
Government will set-aside 30% of appropriate categories of State procurement for purchasing from SMMEs, cooperatives as well as township and rural enterprises.
We will also continue to promote opportunities for the youth. The National Youth Development Agency has disbursed R25 million to 765 youth-owned micro enterprises in the last financial year nationally.
The agency has also partnered with the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and the Small Enterprise Finance Agency in a three-way partnership that has resulted in a R2,7 billion rand fund for young people.
Compatriots,
The year 2015 will mark the beginning of the first phase of broadband roll-out. Government will connect offices in eight district municipalities.
These are Dr Kenneth Kaunda in North West, Gert Sibande in Mpumalanga, O.R. Tambo in the Eastern Cape, Pixley ka Seme in the Northern Cape, Thabo Mofutsanyane in the Free State, Umgungundlovu and Umzinyathi in KwaZulu-Natal, and Vhembe in Limpopo.
Government has also decided to designate Telkom as the lead agency to assist with broadband roll out. As part of further igniting growth, through supporting state-owned companies, processes are underway to implement a 90-day turnaround strategy aimed at stabilising the finances of South African Airways.
Accordingly, some of the loss making international routes will be phased out. But, we will do this in a manner that does not impact negatively on travel, trade and tourism between South Africa and the world.
Compatriots,
The National Infrastructure Development programme continues to be a key job driver and catalyst for economic growth.
Water is a critical resource for economic growth and a better life. Several projects aimed at providing water for industrial and household use are in the implementation or planning phases around the country.
Major projects include Umzimvubu Water Project in the Eastern Cape, Jozini Dam in Umkhanyakude in KwaZulu-Natal and projects in Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga and phase one of the Mokolo Crocodile Water Augmentation in Limpopo.
Progress is being made to improve the water supply to areas that had been affected by shortages, such as Makana District Municipality in the Eastern Cape, Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality in North West and Giyani in Limpopo where we celebrated the delivery of water to 55 villages in October last year.
Let me, Honourable Speaker and Chairperson, urge all in the country to conserve water. Every drop counts. The country loses R7 billion a year to water losses.
To mitigate this challenge, Government through the Department of Water and Sanitation will train 15 000 artisans or plumbers who will fix leaking taps in their local communities. We are happy to have as our special guest, the winner of the Women in Water Conservation Awards, Ms Mapule Phokompe from Mahikeng in North West.
Compatriots,
The infrastructure programme continues to expand transport networks and to improve roads, which augur well for economic growth.
The Department of Transport will spend about R9 billion on the Provincial Roads Maintenance Grant or the Sihamba Sonke Programme and R11 billion on upgrading and maintaining roads which are not tolled.
Over R6 billion will be spent in 13 cities on planning, building and operating integrated public transport networks during this financial year. We will also continue to improve the infrastructure in schools and higher education institutions to create a conducive environment for learning and teaching.
Through the Accelerated School Infrastructure Delivery Initiative which is part of the National Infrastructure Plan, 92 new schools have been completed to date and 108 are under construction. About 342 schools have received water for the first time.
Three hundred and fifty one (351) schools have received decent sanitation while 288 have been connected to electricity.
Siyaqhuba. Siyasebenza. (We are moving forward.) We are a nation at work.
Government has identified 16 sites for the construction of 12 new technical and vocational education and training college campuses and the refurbishment of two existing campuses.
Work is also continuing to establish the three brand new universities, Sol Plaatjie in the Northern Cape, the University of Mpumalanga and the Sefako Makgatho Allied and Health Sciences University.
Honourable members,
We continue to deliver houses to our people. By 30 September 2014, a total number of more than 50 000 houses were delivered in the subsidy and affordable housing segments.
Government will also provide 5 000 housing opportunities for military veterans. Government will also work to eradicate the backlog of title deeds for pre and post-1994 housing stock.
Madam Speaker and Madam Chairperson
We have in the past year introduced some innovative programmes to implement the National Development Plan.
Last year we launched Operation Phakisa, a results-driven laboratory approach to planning and execution of programmes.
Operation Phakisa on the ocean economy is aimed at unlocking opportunities in the shipping, fisheries, aquaculture, mining, oil and gas, bio-technology and tourism sectors.
We have committed R9.2 billion investment in gas and oil exploration in the port of Saldanha as part of the Operation Phakisa initiative.
Operation Phakisa on Scaling Up the Ideal Clinic Initiative is aimed at promoting efficiency, effectiveness and professionalism in clinics.
We will now explore Operation Phakisa in the mining sector. I have instructed Government to partner with the mining sector to develop win-win solutions to beneficiate our mineral resources.
Compatriots and friends,
Over the past five years, government has scored significant gains in health care.
This year, we are going to launch a massive programme to turn the tide against tuberculosis (TB), with a special focus on three communities, offenders at Correctional Services facilities, mineworkers and communities in mining towns.
In fighting the scourge of HIV and AIDS, the state-owned pharmaceutical company, Ketlaphela, has been established and will participate in the supply of anti-retrovirals to the Department of Health.
Madam Speaker and Madam Chairperson,
We have to continue working harder together to fight crime and to create safer communities. We are making progress in fighting crimes against women and children.
The South African Police Service (SAPS) Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Investigation Unit has secured 659 life sentences against perpetrators of crimes against women and children.
We are a democratic state and recognise the community's right to protest. We however appeal that these protests should be within the ambit of the law and must be peaceful as stated in the Constitution.
The police successfully brought under control 13 575 recorded public order incidents, comprising 1 907 unrest-related and 11 668 peaceful incidents.
The fight against corruption continues to be taken forward by the Anti-Corruption Inter-Ministerial Committee.
Government has in place seven anti-corruption institutions and 17 pieces of legislation which are intended to combat corruption. This demonstrates a concerted effort by government to break the back of this scourge in the country.
In the 2013/14 financial year, 52 persons were convicted in cases involving more than R5 million. Thirty one public servants were convicted in the first quarter of 2014/15 and freezing orders to the value of R430 million were obtained.
To prevent corruption and promote ethical governance, in December I signed into law the Public Administration and Management Act which amongst others prohibits public servants from doing business with the State.
Compatriots,
Cabinet has adopted vigorous and integrated interventions to combat the vicious rhino poaching in the country.
The interventions include continuous joint operations with key neighbouring countries, improved intelligence gathering as well as enhancing protection in parks and provincial reserves where rhino are present.
Government has also made substantial progress in establishing a border management agency, to manage all ports of entry and improve security.
To further improve access to identity documents, citizens will from this year be able to apply for the new Smart ID Card at their local bank due to partnership between the Department of Home Affairs and some banks in the country.
Madam Speaker and Madam Chairperson,
Building a caring, effective and responsive state will continue to be prioritised.
In the 2014 SoNA, I said we would continue to advance and improve the lives of people with disabilities. In December last year, Cabinet released the draft National Disability Rights Policy for public comment.

Local government is everybody’s business. We have to make it work.
We have launched the 'Back to Basics' programme to promote good governance and effective administration through cutting wastage, spending public funds prudently, hiring competent staff, and ensure transparency and accountability in municipalities.
The Integrated Urban Development Framework announced in the SoNA last June, has been approved by Cabinet.
Fellow South Africans,
To contribute to building a better Africa, South Africa continued to support peace and security and regional economic integration in the continent.
A number of key outcomes have resulted.
The African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC), of which South Africa is a contributing and founding member, has been operationalised.
The South African National Defence Force and SAPS continued to participate diligently in the conflict prevention and peacekeeping in the continent.
South Africa also continued to support conflict resolution initiatives in Lesotho, Sri Lanka and South Sudan, led by the Deputy President.
Economic cooperation with our BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) partners was strengthened when the first two intergovernmental agreements were concluded on the occasion of the sixth BRICS Summit.
This was the Agreement on the New Development Bank and the Treaty Establishing a Contingent Reserve Arrangement.
Madam Speaker and Chairperson,
Countries of the developed North remain important strategic partners for South Africa through which the country is able to advance its national and foreign policy. We have a valuable partnership with the European Union in amongst others, the Infrastructure Investment Programme for South Africa valued at approximately R1,5 billion.
The renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act beyond September 2015 and a pledge to support African-led peace initiatives in the continent are among the significant outcomes of the United States (US)-Africa Leaders' Summit held in the US last year.

In sports, Team South Africa will participate in the All Africa Games in Congo Brazzaville in 2015.
The Springboks will participate in the International Rugby Board (IRB) World Cup that takes place in England in September 2015.
The Proteas are in Australia and New Zealand to participate in the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup. All South Africans must as usual, rally behind the national teams.
We must also appreciate our Bafana Bafana. I think you will agree with me that this time around they qualified with flying colours.
They were in a group called 'a group of death' and they did their best.
We must give them support, they made us proud.
Honourable members,
We will continue to promote healthy lifestyles and to urge citizens to refrain from smoking and the abuse of alcohol and drugs.
In this regard, on the 10th of May we will mark the Move for Health Day, an international event promoted by the World Health Organisation. The day also coincides with the anniversary of the inauguration of President Mandela.
Compatriots,
Fellow South Africans,
A lot has been achieved in the past year. We believe that our nine-point economic intervention plan on the economy will consolidate the achievements, and ignite much-needed growth.

Fellow South Africans,
Good evening, sanibonani, molweni, riperile, dumelang, ndi madekwana.
It is a great pleasure to address you on this first State of the Nation Address of the fifth democratic administration.
Let me begin by extending our deepest condolences on the sad passing of the Secretary of Parliament, Mr Michael Coetzee.
His contribution to the struggle for freedom and democracy will never be forgotten.
Last week we also lost our mother, Mama Epainette Mbeki. Her guidance and wisdom will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Mbeki family.
Our hearts go out to the families of SANDF members who died in a tragic helicopter crash in Mpumalanga today during a training camp. We wish the injured a speedy recovery.
Fellow South Africans,
We have recently emerged from a successful national general election held on the 7th of May. We look forward to working with all the parties in Parliament as we move South Africa forward.
In the February State of the Nation Address, I related the good story of 20 years of freedom and democracy.
We stated that South Africa is a much better place to live in than it was in 1994, and that the lives of millions of our people have improved.
However, as the National Development Plan and the Presidency Twenty Year Review highlight, the triple challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment continue to affect the lives of many people.
As we enter the second phase of our transition from apartheid to a national democratic society, we have to embark on radical socio-economic transformation to push back the triple challenges.
Change will not come about without some far-reaching interventions.
We have put in place a programme of action based on the ANC Manifesto and the National Development Plan.
The economy takes centre stage in this programme. It remains our strong belief that the most effective weapon in the campaign against poverty, is the creation of decent work, and that creating work requires faster economic growth.
We have set a growth target of 5 per cent by 2019. To achieve this, we will embark on various measures and interventions to jump-start the economy.
We have set this target during a difficult period. The economy has grown below its potential over the last three years and many households are going through difficulties.
The slow growth has been caused in part by the global economic slowdown and secondly by domestic conditions, such as the prolonged and at times violent strikes, and also the shortage of energy.
Given the impact of the untenable labour relations environment on the economy, it is critical for social partners to meet and deliberate on the violent nature and duration of the strikes.
The social partners will also need to deliberate on wage inequality. On our side as Government we will during this term investigate the possibility of a national minimum wage as one of the key mechanisms to reduce the income inequality.
Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will convene the social partners dialogue, within the ambit of NEDLAC.
Secondly, Government will play its part in the implementation of the landmark Framework Agreement for a Sustainable Mining Industry entered into by labour, business and government last year, under the leadership of former Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe.
The process will now be led by the President.
We will implement the undertaking to build housing and other services to revitalize mining towns, as part of the October 2012 agreement between business, government and labour.
The focus is the mining areas of Motlosana, Emalahleni, Sekhukhune, Lephalale, West Rand and Matjhabeng.
An Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Revitalisation of Distressed Mining Communities has been established under the leadership of the Minister in the Presidency responsible for Planning, Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, Mr Jeff Radebe.
The members of the committee include the Ministers of Mineral Resources, Water and Sanitation, Trade and Industry, Social Development, Labour, Human Settlements, Health, Economic Development and Finance.
To further promote improved living conditions for mine workers, Government is monitoring the compliance of mining companies with Mining Charter targets, relating to improving the living conditions of workers.
Companies are expected to convert or upgrade hostels into family units, attain the occupancy rate of one person per room and also facilitate home ownership options for mine workers.
We urge the companies to meet the 2014 deadline for these targets and extend this right to dignity to mine workers.
Honourable Members
The low level of investments is a key constraint to economic growth. We are determined to work with the private sector to remove obstacles to investment.
We will continue to engage business in promoting inclusive growth and to build a more prosperous society. In this regard, I will soon convene a meeting of the Presidential Business Working Group.
After the last meeting of the Working Group last year, six work streams were established and these have been discussing solutions to various obstacles to doing business in South Africa.
These issues were also raised by owners and CEOs of major companies that I hosted in three separate, intensive working sessions at the Mahlamba Ndlopfu residence in November and December last year.
The next meeting of the Working Group will take forward the partnership for inclusive growth and sustainable development.
Fellow South Africans,
We need to respond decisively to the country’s energy constraints in order to create a conducive environment for growth.
The successful electrification programme which has changed the lives of many households was achieved by tapping into artificial electricity reserves, which had not been designed to cater for mass energy distribution.
This situation calls for a radical transformation of the energy sector, to develop a sustainable energy mix that comprises coal, solar, wind, hydro, gas and nuclear energy.
The transformation will require structural changes in the manner in which government departments, affected state owned companies and the industry as a whole address the energy challenges.
The energy plan also calls for the injection of capital and human resources into the energy sector.
We will also need to identify innovative approaches to fast-track procurement and delivery by government in the energy sector.
To prepare the institutional capacity, we are in the process of converting the National Nuclear and Energy Executive Coordinating Committee of Cabinet, into the Energy Security Cabinet Sub-committee.
The sub-committee will be responsible for the oversight, coordination and direction of activities for the energy sector.
The sub-committee will also ensure that Eskom receives the support it requires to fulfil its mandate and that it remains focused on achieving its goals and targets.
To achieve our energy security goals, state owned companies involved in the Energy Sector, such as Eskom, South African Nuclear Energy Corporation and the Central Energy Fund will have to adapt to the redefined roles to achieve these objectives.
Work needs to be done at a technical level on all forms of energy especially nuclear energy and shale gas with regards to funding, safety, exploitation and the local manufacture of components.
Nuclear has the possibility of generating well over 9000 megawatts, while shale gas is recognised as a game changer for our economy.
We will pursue the shale gas option within the framework of our good environmental laws.
There are also some urgent activities that we are engaging in, in the short term. Progress at Medupi power station construction site will be accelerated.
Plans on the financing of the next large coal fired power station, Coal 3, will be speeded up so that the procurement process can commence.
We will also continue the 4th window of the renewable energy independent power producers programme, to take advantage of wind, solar, biomass and other technologies that increase the opportunity for rural development.
Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson,
We are also looking beyond our borders for energy security.
In October last year we signed the Grand Inga Hydro Power Project Treaty with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo. This massive and strategic project has the potential to generate 40 000 megawatts of hydro-electricity.
Our country will benefit enormously from this milestone project.
To prepare for the implementation of the energy plan, we need to finalise the legislation that relates to the restructuring of the energy industry as envisaged by the Independent System Market Operator Bill, the Integrated Resource Plan and other policies affecting the Energy sector.
Honourable members,
Honourable members,
We are a nation at work.
In addition to our major energy security interventions, we will continue to implement the successful National Infrastructure Plan, under the supervision of the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission, throughout the country.
During the past five years, we invested about one trillion rand in new infrastructure to provide water, energy, transport, sanitation, schools and clinics and internet connections to our people.
Over the next three years, we will spend 847 billion rand on the infrastructure and several projects are to be started or completed.
During the next five years the bulk of the construction work on Phase 2 of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project will be completed.
In the next five years, we will finish building more than 60 MeerKat dishes and start building the first 100 Square Kilometre Array dish antennas.
We will expand, modernise and increase the affordability of information and communications infrastructure and electronic communication services, including broadband and digital broadcasting.
Cabinet adopted “South Africa Connect”, our Broadband Policy and Strategy, in December last year to take this mission forward.
We will continue with various other infrastructure projects that will change the living conditions of our people and boost economic growth.
Compatriots
Our radical socio-economic transformation programme will be taken further with the implementation of the Industrial Policy Action Plan.
We will promote local procurement and increase domestic production by having the state buy 75% of goods and services from South African producers.
We will utilise the renewable energy sector, the manufacturing of buses, Transnet’s R50 billion locomotive contracts and PRASA’s passenger rail projects among others, to promote local content and boost growth.
We will also over the next five years promote regional economic development and industrialisation, through the creation of Special Economic Zones around the country.
We will continue to support through incentives, the competitiveness of the auto, clothing, leather, footwear and textile industries, which are labour intensive.
Compatriots
Despite tough global trading conditions in its traditional markets, South Africa’s tourism sector continued to show positive growth in 2013, reaching a record high of 9.6 million international tourist arrivals.
People love our country and continue to visit South Africa.
We have set a target to increase the number of foreign visitor arrivals to more than 15 million annually by 2017.
Over the next five years, we will prioritise support to small business, as well as township and informal sector businesses in particular, thus using the SMME development programme to boost broad-based black economic empowerment.
We will sharpen the implementation of the amended Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Act and the Employment Equity Act, in order to transform the ownership, management and control of the economy.
We will promote more employee and community share ownership schemes and boost the participation of black entrepreneurs in the re-industrialisation of the economy.
Compatriots
The total assets of our Development Finance Institutions amount to some R230 billion.
However, their impact on development is not sufficiently broad-based and their investment programmes are not well coordinated.
The institutions will be repositioned in the next five years to become real engines of socio-economic development.
In the same vein, Postbank will be supported so that it can play a leading role in the expansion of banking services to the poor and the working class.
Honourable members
Compatriots,
Government will introduce further measures to speed up the employment of young people, consistent with the Youth Employment Accord.
We will expand the number of internship positions in the public sector, with every government department and public entity being required to take on interns for experiential training.
The private sector has responded positively to the introduction of the employment tax incentive. In only five months, there are 133 000 employees who have benefited and 11 000 employers who have participated in the incentive scheme.
The majority has been employed in wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing and finance sectors.
Honourable Speaker,
Honourable Chairperson,
Government has since 2004 run the successful Expanded Public Works Programme which provides work opportunities and training for the unemployed. The new phase will provide six million work opportunities by 2019. We are building on the success of the past few years.
The Expanded Public Works programme environmental initiatives such as working on waste, working on wetlands, working for water, working on fire and the Environmental Youth Services programme will also be upscaled up to 2019, in support of youth development.
In addition, the local government- based Community Work Programme will be expanded to provide a million work opportunities by the end of 2019.
Compatriots
We have identified agriculture as a key job driver. Our target is for the agricultural sector to create a million jobs by 2030.
Government will provide comprehensive support to smallholder farmers by speeding up land reform and providing technical, infrastructural and financial support.
Support will be provided to communities as well to engage in food production and subsistence farming to promote food security, in line with the Fetsa Tlala food production programme.
We will accelerate the settlement of remaining land claims submitted before the cut-off date of 1998. We will also re-open the period for the lodgement of claims for the restitution of land for a period of five years, and codify the exceptions to the 1913 cut-off date for the descendants of the Khoi and San.
Honourable Speaker,
Honourable Chairperson,
Sub-Saharan Africa is increasingly becoming a more important trade partner for our country. We are encouraged that South African investments in the continent increased from 5.5 billion rand in 2002 to 32.3 billion rand in 2013.
Our exports into the continent are also increasing each year, having been at 28.5 percent up from 22.6 percent in 2002.
South Africa will continue to champion broader regional integration through the Southern African Customs Union, SADC and the envisaged Tripartite Free Trade Area that spans Eastern and Southern Africa.
Fellow South Africans,
We would like our people’s experience of local government to be a pleasant one.
We have listened to the complaints and proposals of South Africans over the past five years, relating to the performance of municipalities.
Our municipalities are built on a firm foundation, built over the last 20 years of democracy.
We have evaluated all our municipalities.
We have inspected their financial management, how they work within legislative processes as well as their ability to roll out projects and to address capacity constraints.
We have also looked at how they respond to service delivery protests. There have been many successes in many municipalities. However we face a number of challenges in others.
We are pleased that eleven municipalities stand out for consistent good performance in audits, expenditure on municipal infrastructure grants and service delivery.
The eleven municipalities are the following;
2. Cacadu District Municipality.
2. Cacadu District Municipality.
3. Zululand District Municipality.
2. Cacadu District Municipality.
7. The West Coast District Municipality.
6. Knysna Local Municipality.
7. The West Coast District Municipality.
10. Breede Valley Local Municipality and
9. Mossel Bay Local Municipality.
10. Breede Valley Local Municipality and
10. Breede Valley Local Municipality and
We congratulate the municipalities for this performance.
A comprehensive assessment of various municipalities has indicated where they need support.
We will provide assistance to the following municipalities amongst others:
In Amathole District Municipality in the Eastern Cape, our Development Bank of Southern Africa has approved funding to develop infrastructure.
One hundred numerous projects, mainly in water and sanitation, will be started and the objective is to complete them over the next 12 months.
In Umzinyathi District Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, funding will be provided to develop infrastructure projects covering mainly the electrification of households.
The local municipalities to be serviced include Msinga, Umvoti and Nqutu.
In Alfred Nzo District Municipality in the Eastern Cape, funding will be provided for infrastructure development projects covering water provision, sanitation, and electrification.
Local municipalities involved include Mbizana and Ntabankulu, catering for a population of about one million people.
We will support Lukhanji Local Municipality to reorganize its administration and implement support plans for the provision of water and electricity.
We will assist OR Tambo District municipality to stabilise the administration and organizational structure and fast-track the implementation of the Presidential Intervention Plans.
In Mbashe Local Municipality we will implement waste management plans and address ground water contamination issues.
At Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality in the North West, national government will provide support and work with the Development Bank of Southern Africa to resolve financing for water and sanitation infrastructure.
We will support the City of Joburg in Gauteng to resolve problems with the billing system.
We will support Moqhaka Local Municipality in the Free State with the eradication of the bucket system and open toilet challenges.
Meanwhile work is underway to eradicate the bucket system throughout the country. This will also be the priority of the Inter-Ministerial Task Team on Service Delivery that I have established. The team is led by Minister Pravin Gordhan.
The team comprises the Ministers of Planning, Performance Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency, Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, Transport, Home Affairs, Public Enterprises, Energy, Rural Development and Land Reform, Health and Basic Education.
Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson,
A key focus area in local government in the next five years will be how we respond to the reality of rapid urbanisation.
South Africa is becoming an urban country. By 2011 almost 63% of our population were residing in towns and cities and this trend is expected to continue over the coming decade.
Our government’s Integrated Urban Development Framework will be finalised by 30 July 2014.
It will set out a policy framework on how the urban system in South Africa can be reorganised so that cities and towns can become inclusive, resource efficient and good places to live in over the next 20 to 30 years.
Together let us move local government forward!
Compatriots
Over the past twenty years, we have steadily expanded support for marginalised and vulnerable households through investments in housing, extensions to our social grants programmes and improved access to education and primary health care.
Over the period ahead, poverty reduction will continue to be reinforced.
We will continue to invest in education and skills development as that is the key to economic growth and development. We need engineers, electricians, plumbers, doctors, teachers and many other professionals to build our country’s economy.
Education therefore remains an apex priority for this government. We will continue to promote universal access to education by ensuring that all children between ages 7 and 15 are in school.
We will increase the number of Grade 12 learners who can gain entrance to university, moving from 172 000 in 2013 to 250 000 in 2019.
We opened at least one new school a week in the Eastern Cape last year and will continue to eradicate mud schools and other inappropriate structures.
The number of young people in universities and colleges has increased over the years. Contractors will move on site in September to build new universities in the Northern Cape and Mpumalanga.
By January next year, the first intake of medical students will be enrolled at the new medical university in Limpopo.
In addition, 12 training and vocational education colleges will be built to expand the technical skills mix in the country.
Compatriots
Together we must continue to fight drugs and substance abuse in our schools and communities. We will also prioritise safety in schools, scholar transport and child health.
In the area of health, we will work harder to increase life expectancy at birth from 60 years in 2012 to 63 years in 2019.
The campaign to reduce child and maternal mortality ratios will continue.
This will require the implementation of the National Health Insurance and the improvement of the quality of care in the public sector.
We will build on the success of our HIV and AIDS treatment and support programme by expanding our mass HIV prevention communication campaigns.
Compatriots
We will take forward the advances we have made in promoting women’s empowerment and development.
The Minister in the Presidency responsible for Women’s development, Ms Susan Shabangu, will work with other Government departments, agencies, the private sector and non-governmental organisations, to promote women’s socio-economic empowerment, development and human rights.
To further consolidate our democratic gains, we will continue to advance and improve the lives of people with disabilities over the next five years.
We will work with the Disability sector to identify key areas in which we should fulfil South Africa’s role as signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocols.
Another key intervention this term will be to finalise the National Disability Rights Policy which includes the National Disability Rights Framework.
The Policy and the Framework will guide Government action to promote a more inclusive society and to promote the involvement of people with disabilities in decision-making processes.
Fellow South Africans
Some progress has been made over the past five years in reducing the levels of serious crime such as murders, aggravated robberies, crimes against women, children and other vulnerable groups, but they remain unacceptably high.
We will work to further reduce levels of crime.
The Special Investigating Unit, the Anti-Corruption Task Team the Asset Forfeiture Unit and the Hawks, have made notable progress in our quest to combat corruption in society broadly and in the public sector. This work will continue in the next five years.
Weaknesses in procurement, management and operations systems that undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of government will be addressed.
One of the key steps, which is already underway, is to centralise procurement under the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer in the National Treasury.
We have begun piloting this new approach with the centralised procurement of school furniture in the Eastern Cape. The furniture will be delivered in all Eastern Cape schools by the middle of August 2014.
Measures will be introduced to prevent public servants and public representatives from doing business with the state.
These will be supported by improved implementation of the Financial Disclosure Framework, strengthened protection of whistle-blowers, and the provision of technical assistance to departments for the effective management of discipline.
Compatriots
Over the next five years we will continue to promote the building of a better Africa and a more just world.
South Africa will continue to support regional and continental processes to respond to and resolve crises, promote peace and security, strengthen regional integration, significantly increase intra-African trade and champion sustainable development in Africa.
This will entail supporting and executing decisions of the African Union as well as the promotion of the work of its structures.
We will also continue to promote South-South cooperation by utilising membership and engagements with formations and groupings of the South.
Similarly we will continue to promote mutually beneficial relations with countries of the North.
We will continue to deepen economic development, trade, and investment partnerships with the BRICS through the work of the BRICS Contact Group for Economic and Trade Issues.

The South African National Defence Force has been a source of national pride as it participated in peacekeeping missions in the continent.
This role will continue and government is looking into the resourcing of the SANDF mandate in line with recently concluded Defence Review.
Fellow South Africans,
To take this programme of action forward, the Deputy President and I will be meeting with Ministers and Deputy Ministers to discuss the detailed implementation plans for each department.
Each Minister will sign a performance agreement with the President outlining what each department will do to deliver on the programme of action.
Fellow South Africans,
The 17th of June marks the 22nd anniversary of the horrific Boipatong massacre in Gauteng.
Looking back at one of the worst horror stories in recent history, we are reminded of the fact that we need to prioritise healing and nation building more than ever before.
We must continue to build understanding, tolerance and reconciliation, and together fight racism, xenophobia, homophobia and all related intolerances.
The use of sports and culture as a unifying factor in our country will continue during this term. We will also continue to promote the Constitution in schools and ensure that our children grow up with positive values and love for their country and its people.
We will continue to build inclusive heritage over the next five years through building monuments and other symbols that honour the heroes of the struggle that delivered the freedom and democracy we enjoy today.
As part of our 20 years of freedom and democracy celebrations, records turning 20 years this year, such as those of the late former President Nelson Mandela’s first days in Office will be transferred to the National Archives.
This year will also see the listing of the CODESA Multi-Party Negotiating Forum Records in the International Memory of the World Register.
Next month the country and the world will mark International Mandela day.
All South Africans should dedicate at least 67 minutes on the 18th of July, to clean South Africa, which is our theme for this year.
Let us begin planning for a major clean-up of our cities, towns, townships, villages, schools and beautify every part of our country.
Fellow South Africans,
This programme of action is aimed at making South Africa a better place for all.
We urge all South Africans to work with us make the implementation of these programmes a success.
Together let us move South Africa forward.

Fellow South Africans,
Good evening, sanibonani, molweni, dumelang, riperile, ndimadekwana, goeienaand.
I wish to thank the Presiding Officers for this opportunity to speak to the people of South Africa, on this occasion of the last State of the Nation Address, of the fourth democratic administration.
I would like to extend our deepest condolences on the passing of the late Honourable Mr Ben Skhosana, one of the longest serving and most senior members of this august house and our former Minister of Correctional Services.
We are truly saddened by his sudden passing.
Sidlulisa ukukhala kwethu emndenini wakhe, nakumholi we IFP uShenge, kanye namalunga onke e-IFP.
Honourable Speaker,
Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,
This is the first State of the Nation Address to take place in the absence of our founding President, His Excellency Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.
His passing, on the eve of the 20th year of our freedom and democracy,caused untold pain to our people and beyond our borders.
We find solace in the knowledge that Madiba will live forever be in our hearts, and that we have a duty to take his legacy forward.
Honourable Members,
Our country has produced men and women of distinction, who have provided leadership during trying times.
One such leader was Mr Moses Kotane, former treasurer-general of the ANC and former SACP general secretary.
We are honouredto have his dear wife, Mama Rebecca Kotane, as our special guest this evening.
Mama Kotane turned 102 years old yesterday, and we wish her all the best.
We also pay tribute to the former ANC President Mr Oliver Tambo, who kept the torch of freedom alive both at home and abroad during the most difficult times of our struggle.
His son, Dali and his wife Rachel are sharing this occasion with us this evening.
We salute Solomon Mahlangu, a brave young man who went defiantly to the gallows in 1979 where he was executed at the age of 23. He said: “My blood will nourish the tree that will bear the fruits of freedom. Tell my people that I love them. They must continue the fight".
We are honoured to host his mother, Mama Martha Mahlangu and her grand-daughter Bathabile.
The year 2014 also marks the 40th anniversary of the cowardly murder through a parcel bomb, of student leader, Abram Onkgopotse Tiro in 1974 in Botswana.
We welcome his brother, Mogomotsi Tiro to this occasion. We express the gratitude of the people, for his brother’s selfless sacrifice.
We remember those who died in state-sponsored violence of the 1980s and 1990s in our townships and villages.
Ms Jabu Ndlovu, a former shopsteward of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), was gunned down in 1988 in Pietermaritzburg together with her husband Jabulani and their son.
We welcome her daughter Luhle and son, Sanele, and pay tribute to all families who lost their loved ones, across the political spectrum.
Honourable Speaker,
Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,
We were able to overcome all that pain of the past and build a new society.
We have built strong institutions of democracy.
We buried the undemocratic, unrepresentative, oppressive and corrupt state that was serving a minority.
We formed a unitary, non-racial, non-sexist democratic state, answerable to and representative of all South Africans.
We created a thriving constitutional democracy, with well-functioning arms of the state –the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.
We have Chapter 9 institutions which support democracy and protect the rights of citizens.
Liberation and democracy have also created space for an active civil society and a free media.
Liberation also brought for the first time, the promise of gender equality. The representation of women in public institutions has increased considerably since the dawn of freedom, and the extension of basic services also benefits women.
All these attributes have made South Africa a much better place to live in now than it has ever been.
However, our country still faces the triple challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment, which we continue to grapple with. Dealing with these challenges has become a central focus of all democratic administrations.
We elected to focus on five priorities, education, health, the fight against crime and corruption, rural development and land reform as well as creating decent work.
We also reorganised the State to improve performance.
We created two key functions, long term planning as well as monitoring and evaluation.
We established the National Planning Commission which produced the landmark National Development Plan, the country’s socio-economic blueprint and one of the major achievements of this fourth administration.
The Plan outlines what we should do to eradicate poverty, increase employment and reduce inequality by 2030.
Our monitoring and evaluation indicates that many services continue to improve. For example, social grants and identity documents now take a shorter time to be processed. But many others still require further work.
I will report back on the five priorities, starting with the economy.
On average, the economy has grown at 3,2 percent a year from 1994 to 2012 despite the global recession which claimed a million jobs.
Working together as government, business, labour and the community sector, we nursed the economy to a recovery.
The national wealth, measured in terms of GDP, has grown to more than 3.5 trillion rand.
Jobs are now being created again. There are now 15 million people with jobs in the country, the highest ever in our history, and over 650 thousand jobs were created last year, according to Stats SA.
This is still not good enough. The unemployment rate still remains high. Youth unemployment in South Africa continues to be of concern, as it is throughout the world.
We are taking a number of measures, including the Employment Tax Incentive Act which encourages employers to hire younger workers.
Regulations will be passed to ensure that this does not affect unsubsidized or older workers adversely.
Further measures are contained in the National Youth Accord that was signed in Soweto last April.
The Expanded Public Works Programme and the Community Work Programme continue to be an effective cushion for the poor and the youth.
We have created 3,7 million work opportunities over the past five years. Our people obtain an income and skills from the public works programme, which they use to seek formal employment.
Cabinet has set a target of 6 million work opportunities from this year to 2019, targeting the youth.
Our social assistance programme which now reaches about 16 million people, provides a safety for millions, especially vulnerable children.
Imizi eminingi ithola ukusizakala ngenxa yezibonelelo zikahulumeni, imaliyezingane, impesheni yabadala neyabakhubazekile.
Lezizibonelelo zizoqhubeka njalo ngoba imizi eminingi ithola ukusizakala ngoba amathuba emisebenzi ayivelakancane ngalesisikhathi somnotho ontengantengayo.
Lamathuba atholakala kuhulumeni, enza sisho ngeqholo ukuthi, iNingizimuAfrika esiphila kuyo namhlanje, ingcono kakhulu ukunaleyo esasiphila kuyo ngaphambikuka- 1994.
Compatriots,
We are still going through a difficult period.
Developments in the United States economy have led to a rapid depreciation in the emerging market currencies, including the rand.
During the course of 2013, the rand depreciated by 17.6 per cent against the US dollar.
The weaker exchange rate poses a significant risk to inflation and will also make our infrastructure programme more expensive.
However, export companies, particularly in the manufacturing sector, should take advantage of the weaker rand and the stronger global recovery.
While we have these difficulties, we know that we can cope with this period of turbulence.
We have done so before in the past five years.
We will, in fact, emerge stronger if we do the right things.
We have to work together as government, business and labour to grow our economy at rates that are above 5 per cent to be able to create the jobs we need.
Fortunately this collaboration is already taking place.
It is taking place at NEDLAC which is one of the key institutions of cooperation in our democracy, between government, business, labour and the community sector.
It has taken place as well in engagements that we have been having with the business community.
Last year I started engaging business on specific steps that government can take to make it easier to do business in our country.
Arising out of that process, we have now streamlined regulatory and licensing approvals for environmental impact assessments, water licenses and mining licenses.
Parliament is finalizing amendments to the law to give effect to this very positive development, which will cut to under 300 days, the time it takes to start a mine, from application to final approvals.
The Deputy President of the Republic continues to facilitate discussions between government, mining companies and labour.
The purpose is to stabilise industrial relations in this very important sector of our economy. The process is yielding results.
Strikes in the sector were fewer and shorter last year.
And more importantly, industrial relations processes are taking place in a manner consistent with the law.
We have intervened in mining because it is one of our key job drivers. We need a mining sector that works. Mining employs over half a million people.
It is the biggest earner of foreign exchange in our country. It also contributes about 20 billion rand directly to the tax revenue.
Mining also makes a far larger contribution as a buyer of goods and services, and a supplier of inputs to other sectors of our economy and other economies around the globe.
We are exploring partnerships with stakeholders to address the issue of housing in mining towns.
Let me also remind mining companies that 2014 is the deadline for them to improve housing and living conditions of mineworkers and to achieve a number of targets.
Government continues to monitor and enforce compliance on both the company’s Social and Labour Plans and Mining Charter targets.
Fellow South Africans,
Honourable Members,
Other than mining, we had identified five other job drivers in 2009.
These are tourism, agriculture, the green economy, infrastructure development and manufacturing.
The tourism industry has grown dramatically. In 1993, South Africa received a mere 3 million foreign visitors. By 2012, the figure had grown to 13 million visitors.
We will continue to grow this industry, given its potential for job creation.
In 2012 we unveiled the National Infrastructure Plan, led by the President through the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission.
We have subsequently invested one trillion rand in public infrastructure over the past five years.
Many of the projects are completed or are nearing completion.
I will mention just a few.
The Rea Vaya system in Joburg is now used by more than 100 000 Gauteng residents. Similar systems are being built in Cape Town, Tshwane, Nelson Mandela Bay, Buffalo City, eThekwini and Rustenburg.
The country’s harbours and ports have been improved.
We have built a 700 kilometre fuel pipeline from Durban to Gauteng to transport 4 billion cubic litres of petrol, diesel and jet fuel a year.
Close to 1500 kilometres of new roads or lanes have been built.
This progress in respect of roads reminds us of those who have served in this government before who wanted the best for the country, such as our former Transport Minister Mr Dullar Omar.
His dear wife Farieda is one of our guests this evening.
The construction of new rail lines has started in Mpumalanga, to ease the pressure off the roads.
The Gautrain project is now fully functional and carries over 1,2 million passengers a month.
The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa will spend over 120 billion rand over the next 10 years to buy new trains.
Transnet is implementing its massive 300 billion rand market demand strategy, building much needed transport infrastructure.
To realise the economic potential of the Western Cape and the West Coast, we launched the Saldanha Industrial Development Zone and opened two new factories in Atlantis.
To improve the water supply, two large new dams were completed, De Hoop in Limpopo and Spring Grove in KwaZulu-Natal, while phase 2 of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project is to be launched soon.
Construction is continuing at the new power stations, Medupi in Limpopo, Kusile in Mpumalanga and Ingula near Ladysmith, employing more than 30 000 workers.
We continue to explore other sources of energy, in line with the Integrated Resource Plan for Energy.
The development of petroleum, especially shale gas will be a game-changer for the Karoo region and the South African economy.
Having evaluated the risks and opportunities, the final regulations will be released soon and will be followed by the processing and granting of licenses.
We expect to conclude the procurement of nine thousand six hundred megawatts of nuclear energy.
Biofuels manufacturers have been selected and have started work.
Honourable Members
Ours is indeed a country at work and is a much better place to live in. We must keep the momentum.
Honourable Members,
More of our wealth is created through the internet or telecommunication.
A 37 000 kilometres of fibre-optic cable has been laid by the private and public sectors in the past five years. This will be significantly expanded in the years ahead.
We are proud of our successes in science and technology. The construction of the first telescope of the 64-dish forerunner to the Square Kilometre Array, the MeerKAT, will be completed in the first quarter of 2014.
Honourable Members,
Our incentives to boost manufacturing have yielded returns.
The Automotive Investment Scheme that was launched in 2009 has approved a total 3.8 billion rand worth of incentives for about 160 investment projects. These sustain more than 50 thousand jobs.
The companies will be developing sedan cars, minibus taxis and buses.
We have stabilised the clothing, textile, leather and footwear sector, which had been shedding jobs.
Several industries have been designated for local content. These include buses, canned vegetables, clothing, textiles, leather and footwear and other goods.
We have concrete examples of the success of the localisation programme.
In the past two years alone, more than 20 000 minibus taxis and 330 buses were assembled locally, drawing investment and development to our cities.
In the next five years, the state will procure at least 75% of its goods and services from South African producers.
Fellow South Africans,
We have to work more intensively to develop emerging or black industrialists.
Many of the aspirant black industrialists complain about the difficulties they experience in obtaining industrial finance, supplier and retail markets, and technical production support.
The National Empowerment Fund, the Industrial Development Corporation and the Small Enterprise Finance Agency will continue to provide finance to viable black-owned businesses to promote industrialisation.
In addition, we encourage established businesses to support the development of black industrial businesses.
Agriculture is a key job driver and a provider of opportunities for entrepreneurship.
Our agricultural support programme, Fetsa Tlala, is producing brand new exporters.
The first 88 smallholder farmers in this programme supplied the United Nations World Food Programme with 268 tons of maize and beans to send to Lesotho last month. We expect this number to increase.
We will continue to promote our fisheries sector as well, which contributes an estimated 6billion rand to the economy and provides 27 000 jobs.
Honourable Members,
We have made good progress in the land reform programme.
Since 1994, nearly 5,000 farms, comprising 4.2 million hectares, have been transferred to black people, benefiting over 200,000 families.
Nearly 80,000 land claims, totaling 3.4 million hectares, have been settled and 1.8 million people have benefited.
The next administration will need to take forward a number of policy, legislative and practical interventions, to further redress the dispossession of our people of their land.
These include matters relating to the establishment of the Office of the Valuer-General and thereby opening of the lodgement of claims.
Honourable Members
South Africa is indeed a much better place to live in.
Let me now report on our social transformation programme.
Education is a ladder out of poverty for millions of our people.
We are happy therefore that there is a huge increase in the enrolment of children in school, from pre-primary to tertiary level.
The number of children attending Grade R has more than doubled, moving from about 300 thousand to more than 700 thousand between 2003 and 2011.
A Draft Policy Framework towards Universal Access to Grade R has been gazetted for public comment, with a view to making Grade R compulsory.
Bakwethu,
Izingane ezingu 8 million azikhokhiesikoleni, kantiezingu 9 million ithola ukudla okunempilo ezikoleni okuphuma kuhulumeni, ukuze zifunde kahle zingabulawa indlala.
The matric pass rate has gone up from around 61 percent in 2009 to 78 percent last year and the bachelor passes improve each year.
Through the Annual National Assessments, we keep track of improvements and interventions needed, especially, in maths and science.
To promote inclusivity and diversity, the South African Sign Language curriculum will be offered in schools from next year, 2015.
We have increased our numbers of literate adults through the Kha Ri Gude programme from 2,2 million in 2008 to 3 million people.
We have also been investing in teacher training and are re-opening teacher training colleges to meet the demand.
To produce a decent learning environment, we have delivered 370 new schools replacing mud schools and other unsuitable structures around the country. The programme continues.
Compatriots
We have a good story to tell in higher education as well.
Student enrolments at universities increased by 12% while further Education and Training college enrolments have increased by 90%.
We have increased the budgets of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme to 9 billion rand to meet the rising demand.
Another major achievement of this term has been the establishment of two brand new universities, Sol Plaatje in the Northern Cape and the University of Mpumalanga.
We will also build 12 new FET Colleges in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape.
Compatriots,
The launch of the National Education Collaboration Framework last year was an important development for the country. We wish the team well in their national duty.
Compatriots,
We have a good story to tell in the improvement of health care too.
Over the past five years, 300 new health facilities have been built, including 160 new clinics.
Ten new hospitals have been builtor refurbished in Ladybrand, Germiston, Mamelodi, Natalspruit, eThekwini, Zola, Bojanala, Vryburg District, Swartruggens, Khayelitsha and Mitchell’s Plain.
Honourable Speaker
Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP
The HIV and AIDS turnaround is one of the biggest achievements of this administration and we are used as a model country by the United Nations Aids Programmes, (UNAIDS).
Mother to child transmission of HIV has declined sharply and we have doubled the number of people who are receiving anti-retroviral treatment, from one million to 2.4 million people in 2013.
More than 20 million South Africans have taken the HIV test since the launch of the campaign in 2011 which indicates confidence in the health system.
Life expectancy is now firmly on an upward trend. South Africans are now living longer.
The target for the next administration is to ensure that at least 4.6 million people are enrolled in the anti-retroviral programme.
We acknowledge the contribution of the South African National Aids Council for the hard work.
While celebrating our success, we must not be complacent. The prevention work must still continue so that we can reach that goal of zero HIV infections sooner.
At a broader level, we will enter a new phase in the implementation of the National Health Insurance programme which will extend quality healthcare to the poor.
Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,
Honourable Speaker
The overall crime rate has decreased by 21 percent since 2002 and work is ongoing to make communities safer.
One of the key focus areas is to eradicate violence against women and children. We have introduced a number of measures to respond to this challenge.
These include the reopening of the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units as well as the Sexual Offences Courts.
We thank the many NGOs that promote the rights of women and children who contribute positively to this important work.
Our country continues to be the target of rhino poachers.
Our law enforcement agencies are working hard to arrest this scourge. We have also reached agreements with China, Vietnam, Kenya, Mozambique and other SADC countries to work together to stop this crime.
We thank the business community and all South Africans who participate in the campaign to save the rhino.
Compatriots
The independence of the judiciary has been further enhanced by the establishment of the Office of the Chief Justice as a separate institution from the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development. We have passed several pieces of legislation to support this new role of the Office of the Chief Justice.
Progress is being made in the transformation of the judiciary to reflect the race and gender demographics of the country.
The Chief Justice of the Republic continues to champion and lead this transformation.
Black judges (African, Indian and Coloured) now constitute 61% of all judges.
However, the acute under-representation of women on the bench remains of concern. Of the judicial establishment of 239 judges, only 76 are women.
The challenge is to transform the legal profession broadly in order to nourish the pool from which female judges can be appointed.
The finalisation of the Legal Practice Bill will assist to broaden the pool from which potential judicial officers could be selected.
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
South Africans are united in wanting a corruption free society. Fighting corruption within the public service is yielding results.
Since the launch of the National Anti-Corruption Hotline by the Public Service Commission, over 13 000 cases of corruption and maladministration have been referred to government departments for further handling and investigation.
Government has recovered more than 320-million rand from perpetrators through the National Anti-Corruption Hotline.
Some of the successes of the National Anti-Corruption Hotline include the following:
• 1 542 officials were dismissed from the Public Service.
• 140 officials were fined their three month salary.
• 20 officials were demoted
• 355 officials were given final written warnings.
• 204 officials were prosecuted.
To prevent corruption in the supply chain system, government has decided to establish a central tender board to adjudicate tenders in all spheres of government.
This body will work with the chief procurement officer whose main function will be to check on pricing and adherence to procedures as well as fairness.
The Special Investigating Unit is investigating maladministration or alleged corruption in a number of government departments and state entities, through 40 proclamations signed by the President during this administration. We will keep the public informed of the outcome of the investigations.
In the first six months of last year, the Asset Forfeiture Unit paid a total of 149 million rand into the Criminal Assets Recovery Account and to the victims of crime.
This is 170% above its target of 55 million rand and is higher than it has ever achieved in a full year.
Last year, the competition authorities investigated large-scale price fixing in the construction industry and fined guilty companies 1.4 billion rand.
Further steps against those involved are now underway.
Compatriots,
I would now like to touch briefly on the provision of basic services to our people.
Over the past 20 years, remarkable achievements have been made in increasing access to services such as water, sanitation and electricity.
Government has begun an intensive programme to eliminate the bucket system as part of restoring the dignity of our people.
Phase One of the programme will eradicate buckets in formalized townships of the Free State, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape.
Phase Two will eradicate buckets in informal settlements in all provinces.
In housing, about 3 million housing units and more than 855 thousand serviced sites were delivered since 1994.
Nearly 500 informal settlements have been replaced with quality housing and basic services over the past five years.
The next administration will promote better located mixed income housing projects.
Compatriots,
Some communities still do not have these services especially in informal settlements and rural areas. We are therefore working with all spheres of government to ensure the provision of these services, especially in the 23 municipalities with the greatest number of backlogs.
Compatriots
In last year’s State of the Nation Address, I raised my concern with the manifestation of violence in some of the protests taking place in our country.
Violent protests have taken place again around the country in the past few weeks.
Also worrying is what appears to be premeditated violence, as is the case with the use of petrol bombs and other weapons during protests.
The democratic government supports the right of citizens to express themselves.
The right to protest, peacefully and unarmed, is enshrined in the Constitution.
However, when protests threaten lives and property and destroy valuable infrastructure intended to serve the community, they undermine the very democracy that upholds the right to protest.
The dominant narrative in the case of the protests in South Africa has been to attribute them to alleged failures of government.
However the protests are not simply the result of “failures” of government but also of the success in delivering basic services.
When 95% of households have access to water, the 5% who still need to be provided for, feel they cannot wait a moment longer.
Success is also the breeding ground of rising expectations.
Let me also add Honourable Members, that any loss of life at the hands of the police in the course of dealing with the protests cannot be overlooked or condoned.
Loss of life is not a small matter. We need to know what happened, why it happened. Any wrongdoing must be dealt with and corrective action must be taken. Police must act within the ambit of the law at all times.
Having said this, we should also as a society be concerned that between 2005 and 2013, close to 800 police officers were killed.
The police are protectors and are the buffer between a democratic society based on the rule of law, and anarchy. As we hold the police to account, we should be careful not to end up delegitimising them and glorify anarchy in our society.
The culture of violence originated from the apartheid past. We need to conduct an introspection in our efforts to get rid of this scourge.
As leaders from all walks of life, we must reflect on what we did or did not do, to systematically root out the violence that surfaced in protests during the early days of our democracy.
We have a collective responsibility to build a society that respects the rule of law, respects one another and which respects life and property.
We should work together to rebuild Ubuntu and a culture of responsibility in our society.
Honourable Speaker,
Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,
A decision has been taken to improve functioning of local government.
The amendment of the Municipal Systems Act is intended to improve the capacity of municipalities to deliver services.
Qualified and experienced personnel must be deployed in municipalities.
We also need to strengthen existing forums of people’s participation and enable our people to play a greater role in development.
The fight against corruption must be intensified as well, especially given reports that some services are interrupted or stopped, so that certain people could provide those services at cost to the state.
These matters are being prioritised for the next administration.
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson
Democratic South Africa’s foreign policy was shaped many decades ago during the fierce international campaign to isolate the apartheid state.
ANC President Oliver Tambo played a key role in that regard, assisted by among others, the late Johnny Makatini, former head of international affairs.
His wife, Mrs Valerie Makatini is one of our honoured guests this evening.
Africa has remained at the centre of our foreign policy.
We have worked hard to strengthen support for the African Union, SADC and all continental bodies whose purpose is to achieve peace and security.
We have also prioritised the promotion of regional economic integration, infrastructure development, intra-African trade and sustainable development in the continent.
This year we also submitted our third country report to the AU African Peer Review Mechanism which was well received.
We continue to support peacemaking and conflict resolution.
Progress is being made in negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan on outstanding issues following the secession.
Following requests from Sri Lanka and South Sudan for assistance in bringing about peace and reconciliation, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, has been appointed as South Africa’s Special Envoy to the two countries.
His expertise in conflict resolution and negotiations as well as our country’s experience in this regard, will greatly assist the two countries to resolve their problems.
We will continue to strengthen relations with Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia and countries in the South.
Participation in international multilateral forums such as the G20 have been beneficial for the country.
And joining the Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) group in December 2010 counts as among the key achievements of the fourth administration.
It was also a great honour to host the Fifth BRICS Summit on 27 March 2013 in Durban, which saw the participation of African leaders to discuss developmental cooperation with BRICS.
We will continue to serve diligently in the United Nations in promotion of strong international governance.
We will also continue promoting the reform of the UN Security Council and global financial institutions.
Honourable Members
As President of the COP17/CMP7 United Nations Climate Change conference which was hosted in Durban in 2011, South Africa successfully placed the world on an unassailable course, through the adoption of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action.
Compatriots,
Over the past 20 years we have hosted a number of international sporting and cultural visits, which has helped to boost social cohesion and unity.
In the past five years, South Africa hosted the highly successful 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup and other key soccer, rugby and cricket tournament, which left a tangible feeling of pride and unity among all South Africans.
As we celebrate 20 years of freedom, we will do so having done well in building a new heritage landscape for our country.
A number of new museums and monuments were established, including the statue of Former President Mandela which has become a landmark in the Union Buildings.
More than 2000 geographical names have been changed in order to correct the ill-naming of places, as well as to give communities the right to determine the names of their areas.
Honourable Members
Allow me to acknowledge some of our compatriots who are making their mark in the world.
We congratulate Ladysmith Black Mambazo on winning their fourth Grammy Award last month. We welcome the group leader, Mr Joseph Shabalala, one of our guests this evening.
We also acknowledge Ms Yvonne Chaka Chaka who is one of our guests this evening.
She is doing a lot of good work as the United Nations Children’s Fund Goodwill Ambassador for Malaria in Africa and also the United Nations Millennium Development Goals Special Envoy for Africa.
Ms Chaka Chaka was also honoured with the Crystal Award by the World Economic Forum in Davos for her humanitarian work.
We also recognise, in her absence, our Oscar Award-winning Hollywood star, Ms Charlize Theron.
Ms Theron is also the UN Messenger for Peace. She also champions the fight against AIDS especially amongst the youth and young women.
She was also honoured by the World Economic Forum with a Crystal Award.
Compatriots
You would have noticed that in this SONA we have given a report of the past five years in particular and over the past 20 years in general.
This is not an occasion to present the programme of action for this financial year. That programme will be presented by the new government after the elections.
To prepare for that first State of the Nation Address by the incoming administration later in the year, we have over the past year, been working on a Medium Term Strategic Framework.
The Framework has been designed as the first five year building block of the National Development Plan, from 2014 to 2019.
It also incorporates key targets of the Industrial Policy Action Plan, the New Growth Path and Infrastructure Plan.
The intention is to table the draft Framework to the first Cabinet Lekgotla after the elections.
It will be refined by the new administration in line with its electoral mandate, so that work can start as soon as possible after the formation of a new government.
It has been an honour for my administration and I to build on the foundation laid by the first three democratic administrations, to serve the people of South Africa.
As a country we have scored many successes.
South Africa is a much better place to live in now than it was before 1994.
We continue to face challenges. But life will also continue to change for the better.
Nkosi Sikelel’ i Africa
God Bless Afrika.
I thank you.

Invited guests,
Veterans of the struggle for liberation,
Members of the diplomatic corps,
Fellow South Africans,
Good evening, sanibonani, molweni, dumelang, goeienaand, lotjhani, ri perile, ndi madekwana.
Thank you for the opportunity to address Parliament and the nation.
Today marks the 26th anniversary of the release of President Nelson Mandela from prison, which was one of the most remarkable episodes in the history of our country.
It is also the 50th anniversary of the declaration by the National Party regime that District Six would be a whites only area, leading to the forced removals of more than 60 000 residents.
The year 2016 also marks the 20th anniversary of the signing into law by Madiba, of the Constitution of the Republic. The signing took place in Sharpeville on 10 December 1996.
We are proud of our democracy and what we have achieved in a short space of time. Our democracy is functional, solid and stable.
Compatriots, the Constitution, which has its foundation in the Freedom Charter, proclaims that South Africa belongs to all who live in it. A lot has been done to promote inclusion and a non-racial society.
However, the journey to a non-racial society has not yet been completed.
The nation was shaken last month when racism reared its ugly head on social and electronic media, causing untold pain and anger. There is a need to confront the demon of racism. Human Rights Day, 21 March, will be commemorated as the national day against racism this year. It will be used to lay the foundation for a long-term programme of building a non-racial society.
Compatriots, I would like to remind you of a few other important anniversaries.
The year 2016 marks 60 years since the women’s march to the Union Buildings to demand an end to pass laws. We are happy to have in our midst Ms Sophie de Bruyn, who was among the heroic leaders of that historic march.
We also acknowledge the former president of the Black Sash, Ms Mary Burton. We acknowledge the organisation’s track record in fighting for human rights, justice and equality.
This year also marks 40 years since the landmark 16 June student uprising in Soweto.
We welcome the photographer who shot the famous photograph of Hector Pieterson carried by Mbuyisa Makhubu with his sister Antoinette, Mr Sam Nzima.
We also salute the class of 1976 for their bravery in standing up against the brutal apartheid regime. We acknowledge one of the activists of that era, the Deputy Secretary of Parliament, Ms Baby Tyawa, who is in our midst.
This year we also mark 30 years since the ambush and brutal killing of the Gugulethu Seven by the apartheid police in March 1986.
The University of Fort Hare celebrates its centenary, which is a critical milestone in the liberation history of not only our country but the continent. The national celebrations will take place on 20 May.
Let me recognise uMntwana wakwaPhindangene, the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party who is a former student of the university.
The year 2016 also marks the centenary of the battle of Delville Wood in France, which took place during the First World War.
Scores of black soldiers fought in the war but were treated badly due to the colour of their skin.
A memorial that will restore their dignity and humanity is scheduled to be unveiled in July this year in France.
Compatriots, allow me as well to recognise three special guests who are also with us today:
• the Chairperson of the National Church Leaders Forum and Archbishop of Cape Town, Archbishop Thabo Makgoba,
• Archbishop Daniel Matebesi, the President of the National Interfaith Council of South Africa, and
• Bishop Zipho Siwa, the Presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa and the President of the South African Council of Churches.
Madam Speaker and Madam Chairperson,
A resilient and fast growing economy is at the heart of our radical economic transformation agenda and our National Development Plan (NDP).
When the economy grows fast it delivers jobs. Workers earn wages and businesses make profits.
The tax base expands and allows government to increase the social wage and provide education, health, social grants, housing and free basic services ¬– faster and in a more sustainable manner.
Our economy has been facing difficulties since the financial crisis in 2008. We embarked on an aggressive infrastructure development programme to stimulate growth.
Our reality right now is that global growth still remains muted. Financial markets have become volatile. Currencies of emerging markets have become weak and they fluctuate widely.
The prices of gold, platinum, coal and other minerals that we sell to the rest of the world have dropped significantly and continue to be low.
The economies of two of our partners in BRICS, Brazil and Russia, are expected to contract this year. The third, China, will not register the kind of robust growth that it is known for.
Because our economy is relatively small and open, it is affected by all of these developments. Our economy is also affected by domestic factors such as the electricity constraints and industrial relations which are sometimes unstable.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank predict that the South African economy will grow by less than 1% this year. The lower economic growth outcomes and outlook suggest that revenue collection will be lower than previously expected.
Importantly, our country seems to be at risk of losing its investment grade status from ratings agencies. If that happens, it will become more expensive for us to borrow money from abroad to finance our programmes of building a better life for all, especially the poor.
The situation requires an effective turnaround plan from us. It is about doing things differently and also acting on what may not have been acted upon quickly before.
I will share a few points that we believe would make a difference.
First, our country remains an attractive investment destination. It may face challenges, but its positive attributes far outweigh those challenges.
We must continue to market the country as a preferred destination for investments. This requires a common narrative from all of us as business, labour and government.
If there are any disagreements or problems between us, we should solve them before they escalate. This is necessary for the common good of our country.
We have had fruitful meetings with business, including the high level meeting with chief executive officers on Tuesday (9 February) this week.
We have heard the suggestions from the business community on how we can turn the situation around and put the economy back on a growth path.
We have heard the points about the need to create the correct investment support infrastructure.
Government is developing a One Stop Shop/Invest SA initiative to signal that South Africa is truly open for business. We will fast-track the implementation of this service, in partnership with the private sector.
Such an initiative requires that government removes the red tape and reviews any legislative and regulatory blockages.
We have established an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Investment Promotion which will ensure the success of investment promotion initiatives.
Compatriots, we have heard the concerns raised about the performance of state owned enterprises and companies.
Many of our state-owned companies (SOCs) are performing well. The South African National Roads Agency Limited has built some of the best roads in Gauteng and in many parts of the country. These make us the envy of many parts around the globe.
The Trans Caledon Tunnel Authority has constructed dams of varied capacities, thus making it possible for our people to have access to safe drinking water.
Transnet has built rail infrastructure which has enabled our country’s mines to move massive bulk of commodities through our ports to markets around the globe.
Eskom, in spite of the challenges, still manages to keep the economy going, against all odds.
Our development finance institutions such as the Industrial Development Corporation or Development Bank of Southern Africa and others have provided finance for infrastructure, various industries and agricultural businesses without fail, even in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
For the SOCs to contribute to the successful implementation of the NDP, they must be financially sound.
They must be properly governed and managed. We will ensure the implementation of the recommendations of the Presidential Review Commission on State-owned Enterprises, which outlines how the institutions should be managed.
The Deputy President chairs the Inter-Ministerial Committee which is tasked with ensuring the implementation of these recommendations.
We have to streamline and sharpen the mandates of the companies and ensure that where there are overlaps in the mandates, there is immediate rationalisation.
Those companies that are no longer relevant to our development agenda will be phased out.
Government departments to which they report, will set the agenda and identify key projects for the SOCs to implement, over a defined period. Proper monitoring and evaluation will be done.
These interventions are essential for growth and also for the reduction of national debt levels.
Compatriots, we must take advantage of the exchange rate as well as the recent changes of visa regulations, to boost inbound tourism.
SA Tourism will invest R100 million a year to promote domestic tourism, encouraging South Africans to tour their country.
We have heard concerns from companies about delays in obtaining visas for skilled personnel from abroad. While we prefer that employers prioritise local workers, our migration policy must also make it possible to import scarce skills.
The draft migration policy will be presented to Cabinet during the course of 2016.
We have heard the appeals for policy certainty in the mining sector, especially with regards to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill.
The Bill was referred back to Parliament last year. We await Parliament to conclude the processing, which we trust will be done expeditiously.
Compatriots, we need to empower small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) to accelerate their growth. Access to high-quality, innovative business support can dramatically improve the success rate of new ventures.
The Department of Small Business Development was established to provide such targeted support to small business.
Economic transformation and black empowerment remain a key part of all economic programmes of government. One of our new interventions is the Black Industrialists Scheme, which has been launched to promote the participation of black entrepreneurs in manufacturing.
We urge big business to partner with new manufacturers including businesses owned by women and the youth, as part of broadening the ownership and control of the economy.
Compatriots, we are proud of our Top 10 ranking in the World Economic Forum competitiveness report with respect to financial services.
Maintaining and indeed improving our ranking is important to our competitiveness as a country.
It is also fundamental to our ambition to become a financial centre for Africa.
The banks, through the Banking Association of South Africa, are to launch a project aimed at establishing a centre of excellence for financial services and leadership training.
This will ensure that as a country we can attract, nurture, develop and retain the best talent in financial services in our country and across our continent.
They will work with the Minister of Finance and National Treasury to get this done. We believe that this will over time ensure that we can expand the pool of financial skills and broaden the job opportunities for many young people.
This strategic project from the banking sector is a positive and encouraging outcome of our engagement with business this week.
Together we move South Africa Forward!
Compatriots, we have made an undertaking to spend public funds wisely and to cut wasteful expenditure, but without compromising on the core business of government and the provision of services to our people.
In 2013, the Minister of Finance announced a number of cost-containment measures. Excessive and wasteful expenditure has been reduced, but there is still more to be done to cut wastage.
I would like to announce some measures this evening. Overseas trips will be curtailed and those requesting permission will have to motivate strongly and prove the benefit to the country.
The sizes of delegations will be greatly reduced and standardised. Further restrictions on conferences, catering, entertainment and social functions will be instituted.
The budget vote dinners for stakeholders hosted by government departments in Parliament, after the delivery of budget speeches will no longer take place. The Minister of Finance will announce more measures and further details in the budget vote speech on 24 February.
The executive management and boards of public agencies and SOCs must undertake similar measures. I also invite Premiers of all nine provinces as well as mayors to join us as we begin eliminating wasteful expenditure within government. I trust that Parliament and the judiciary will also be persuaded to consider the implementation of similar measures.
Compatriots, a big expenditure item, that we would like to persuade Parliament to consider, is the maintenance of two capitals, Pretoria as the administrative one and Cape Town as the legislative capital.
We believe that the matter requires the attention of Parliament soon. Compatriots, we all have a lot to do to turn the economy around and to cut wastage. We will go through a difficult period for a while, but when the economy recovers, we will be proud of ourselves for having done the right thing.
Compatriots, I would now like to report back on the undertakings made last year.
During the State of the Nation Address in February 2015, I announced the Nine-Point Plan to respond to sluggish growth.
The Nine-Point Plan consists of:
a. Revitalisation of the agriculture and agro-processing value-chain;
b. Advancing beneficiation adding value to our mineral wealth;
c. More effective implementation of a higher impact Industrial Policy Action Plan;
d. Unlocking the potential of SMMEs, cooperatives, township and rural enterprises;
e. Resolving the energy challenge;
f. Stabilising the labour market;
g. Scaling-up private-sector investment;
h. Growing the ocean economy;
i. Cross-cutting areas to reform, boost and diversify the economy;
i. Science, technology and innovation
ii. Water and sanitation
iii. Transport infrastructure
iv. Broadband roll-out
v. SOCs.
We have made significant progress in the implementation of the plan.
Progress has been made to stabilise the electricity supply. There has been no load shedding since August last year, which has brought relief to both households and industry alike.
Government has invested R83 billion in Eskom, which has enabled the utility to continue investing in Medupi and Kusile, while continuing with a diligent maintenance programme.
Additional units from Ingula power station will be connected in 2017, even though some of them will begin synchronisation this year. The multiple bid windows of the Renewable Independent Power Producer Programme have attracted an investment of R194 billion.
This initiative is a concrete example of how government can partner with the private sector to provide practical solutions to an immediate challenge that faces our country.
In 2016, government will select the preferred bidders for the coal independent power producer. Request for proposals will also be issued for the first windows of gas to power bids.
The nuclear energy expansion programme remains part of the future energy mix.
Our plan is to introduce 9 600 megawatts of nuclear energy in the next decade, in addition to running Koeberg Nuclear Power Plant.
We will test the market to ascertain the true cost of building modern nuclear plants.
Let me emphasise that we will only procure nuclear on a scale and pace that our country can afford.
Compatriots, our government, through the Department of Trade and Industry, introduced a number of incentives in the past few years to boost investments in the manufacturing sectors especially textiles, leather and the automotive sectors.
Progress has been made in these sectors.
The incentives for the automotive sector have attracted investments of over R25 billion over the last five years. We welcome key investments from Mercedes, General Motors, Ford, Beijing Auto Works, the Metair group, BMW, Goodyear and VW.
The clothing and textile sector has also been successfully stabilised after a difficult few years.
Multinational companies such as Nestle, Unilever, Samsung and Hisense have also affirmed South Africa as a regional manufacturing hub.
They have retained and expanded their investments in new plants.
Indeed the progress made in manufacturing has certainly demonstrated that the incentive programmes are effective and attractive to investors.
Compatriots, I announced programmes for the revitalisation of agriculture last year. We introduced the Agri-Parks Programme, aimed at increasing the participation of small holder farmers in agricultural activities.
Construction has begun in at least five agri-parks, which are: West Rand in Gauteng, Springbokpan in North West, Witzenberg in the Western Cape, Ncora in the Eastern Cape and Ekangala in Mpumalanga.
The agricultural programmes must empower women farmers as well. Allow me to introduce the winner of the Female Entrepreneur of the Year 2015, Ms Julia Shungube, from Nkomazi Local Municipality in Mpumalanga.
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
Land reform remains an important factor as we pursue transformation. I spoke about the 50/50 policy framework last year, which proposes relative rights for people who live and work on farms.
Twenty-seven proposals have been received from commercial farmers and four are being implemented in the Eastern Cape and the Free State.
I also announced the Regulation of Land Holdings Bill, which would place a ceiling on land ownership at a maximum of 12 000 hectares and would prohibit foreign nationals from owning land. They would be eligible for long term leases. The draft Bill will be presented to Cabinet in the first semester of the year.
We also announced the reopening of land claims for people who had missed the 1998 deadline. The number of new land claims that have been lodged stood at close to 120 000 as of December last year.
Compatriots, as we are aware, five provinces have been seriously affected by drought, namely North West, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Limpopo and Mpumalanga.
Government provides relief to affected communities. Isomiso sixakile impela ezifundazweni eziningi. Imfuyo iyafa kanti nezolimo zisele emuva. Isikhathi esinzima lesi.
Uhulumeni uzoqhubeka nokuxhasa abalimi kanye nokusiza imiphakathi ngezimoto ezithwala zamanzi.
(The drought that is currently taking place in most of our provinces is really devastating. Livestock is dying and as a result, the agricultural sector is going through a difficult period. These are tough times indeed. Government will continue to assist farmers and also provide water-tank services to communities).
Let me take this opportunity to commend the civil society initiative, Operation Hydrate and others for the provision of water relief to many communities in distress.
The building of water infrastructure remains critical so that we can expand access to our people and industry.
The first phase of the Mokolo and Crocodile Water Augmentation project in Lephalale area in Limpopo is fully operational. It will provide 30 million cubic meters of water per annum.
The raising of the Clan William Dam wall in the Western Cape entails raising the existing dam level by 13 metres to provide additional water supply.
To curb water wastage, the Department of Water and Sanitation has begun its programme of training 15 000 young people as artisans.
Madam Speaker, Madam Chairperson,
On improving labour relations, we welcome the agreement reached by social partners at National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC) on the principle of a national minimum wage.
Deliberations continue on the level at which the minimum wage must be placed.
It is important to emphasise that the national minimum wage should be implemented in a manner that does not undermine employment creation, the thriving of small businesses or sustained economic growth.
We are also encouraged by reports from NEDLAC that a framework to stabilise the labour market by reducing the length of strikes and eliminating violence during strike action is being finalised.
We have heard the concerns of labour about the Tax Amendment Act that I signed into law in December, following its passing by Parliament.
Government is in discussion with the Congress of South African Trade Unions about the matter and a solution is being sought.
Discussions are also ongoing within government, led by the Department of Social Development and National Treasury, with regards to finalising the comprehensive social security policy.
Compatriots, only a few years ago, our mining sector was in turmoil especially on the platinum belt. The situation has improved and we commend business and labour for the progress made.
Another positive development in the mining sector was the Leaders’ Declaration to Save Jobs which was signed by mining industry stakeholders in August 2015.
We urge the parties to implement the agreement and to continue seeking ways of saving jobs.
We appeal to business again that retrenchments should not be the first resort when they face difficulties.
Compatriots, in 2014 we launched the popular Operation Phakisa Big Fast results methodology and implemented it in the ocean economy, health, education and mining sectors.
Seven billion rand has been committed in new port facilities, following the adoption of a Public- Private-Partnership model for port infrastructure development by Transnet National Ports Authority.
Compatriots, we were concerned that South Africa did not own vessels while we are surrounded by about 3 000 km of a coastline.
Through the oceans economy segment of Operation Phakisa, we are trying to solve this challenge.
I am pleased that two bulk-carrier vessels have been registered in Port Elizabeth, and a third tanker in Cape Town under the South African flag.
Another positive Operation Phakisa development has been the launch of a fuel storage facility here in Cape Town, bringing an investment of R660 million.
Aquaculture appears to be an important growth area within the oceans economy segment of Operation Phakisa.
Close to R350 000 private-sector investment has thus far been committed in the aquaculture sector. Nine aquaculture farms are already in production. These farms are located within the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape and the Northern Cape.
We continue to promote innovation within the Nine-Point Plan programme.
The Department of Science and Technology will finalise the Sovereign Innovation fund, a Public-Private funding partnership aimed at commercialising innovations that are from ideas from the public and the private sectors.
Government will fast-track the implementation of the first phase of broadband roll-out to connect more than 5 000 government facilities in eight district municipalities over a three-year period.
Funding to the tune of R740 million over a three-year period has been allocated in this regard.
Compatriots, a lot of work was done in the social sector as well in the past year.
Government has responded to the financial shortfall arising from the zero per cent university fee increase, as agreed in meeting with students and vice-chancellors last year.
The Minister of Finance will provide the details of education shortfall funding in the Budget Speech.
I have appointed a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into higher education. We urge all stakeholders to cooperate with the commission and help ensure its success.
On the health front, the life expectancy of South Africans for both males and females has significantly improved and is currently 62 years across genders, which is an increase of eight and a half years since 2005.
The HIV policy turnaround in 2009 led to a massive roll-out of HIV testing and treatment for 3,2 million people living with the virus.
This has contributed immensely to healthier and longer lives for those infected.
We acknowledge the contribution of partners in the South African National AIDS Council, which is chaired by the Deputy President.
Our next step is to revive prevention campaigns especially amongst the youth. The Minister of Health will soon announce a major campaign in this regard.
I am also happy to announce that the state-owned pharmaceutical company, Ketlaphela, has been established. The company will participate in the supply of anti-retroviral drug to the Department of Health from the 2016/17 financial year.
Meanwhile, the White Paper on National Health Insurance was released in December and is aimed at improving healthcare for everyone in South Africa.
Compatriots, local government elections will be held within three months after 18 May, the date of the last elections.
We urge all citizens who are over the age of 18 to register to vote during the first registration weekend, 5 and 6 March 2016.
We urge the youth, in particular who are turning 18 years of age this year, to register in their numbers for this first-ever opportunity to cast their votes.
Our Back to Basics local government revitalisation plan was launched in September 2014 and 2015 has been the year of intensive implementation.
In this second phase of implementation, national government will engage in more active monitoring and accountability measures.
This includes unannounced municipal visits, spot checks of supply chain management processes, the implementation of recommendations of forensic reports, site visits of Municipal Infrastructure Grant funded projects, and increased interventions to assist struggling municipalities.
A 10-point plan of Back to Basics priority actions has been developed to guide this next phase.
The plan includes the promotion of community engagement, which is absolutely critical to enable communities to provide feedback on their experience of local government.
I already undertook a walkabout at Marabastad taxi and bus rank in Pretoria on Monday (8 February) to speak to informal traders and commuters.
The majority of complaints and issues raised related to municipal services.
They would like the Tshwane municipality to clean the area and also to fix some broken sewerage pipes. Traders said they needed and were prepared to pay.
They alerted me that many people in Elandspoort receive RDP houses but instead of occupying them, they either sell them or rent them out to other people.
Mrs Baloyi, who runs a stall, complained about nyaope drug addicts who steal goods from traders. Other commuters said I must visit Kwaggafontein in the former KwaNdebele and see the lack of service delivery. I will visit the area soon.
I was also able to speak to foreign nationals who said they queue daily to apply for documentation from the Department of Home Affairs. We will continue to visit communities to hear their concerns and suggestions. Issues raised during the visit will be followed up by the respective departments.
Compatriots, the South African Police Service is undergoing a turnaround and has adopted the Back to Basics approach to management to rebuild the organisation and to improve performance at all under-performing police stations.
We note sadly, as well that 57 police officers have been murdered to date during the 2015/16 financial year. We condemn this criminality strongly.
We urge the police to defend themselves when attacked, within the confines of the law.
Compatriots, the African continent remains central to our foreign policy engagements.
South Africa continued to support peace and security and regional economic integration through participation in the African Union and the Southern African Development Community initiatives.
We continued to assist sister countries in resolving their issues, for example, in Lesotho and South Sudan.
The South African National Defence Force represented the country bravely and remarkably well in peacekeeping missions on the continent. We are truly proud of our soldiers. They will be showcasing their capability in Port Elizabeth from 13 to 21 February, the celebration of Armed Forces Day.
The agreement by BRICS nations on the New Development Bank or BRICS Bank came into force and the bank is envisaged to approve its inaugural projects in April this year.
We participated in the India-Africa Summit as well as the Forum on Cooperation between Africa and China as we strengthened these important partnerships.
China announced investments of US$50 billion of which South Africa will receive US$10 billion for infrastructure, industrialisation and skills development.
On North-South cooperation, we continued our engagements with the European Union (EU) as a bloc, which is our largest trading partner and foreign investor.
Over 2 000 EU companies operate within South Africa, creating over 350 000 jobs.
South Africa’s relations with the United States of America and Canada continue to strengthen, especially in the areas of economy, health, education, energy, water, safety and security, capacity building and the empowerment of women.
The renewal and expansion of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) provides a platform for the enhancement of industrialisation and regional integration. All outstanding issues around AGOA are being attended to.
Compatriots, we extend good wishes to all athletes who have qualified for the Olympic Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro. We encourage participation in several programmes aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles and nation building.
These include the National Recreation Day, the Nelson Mandela Sports and Culture Day; the World Move for Health Day, the Golden Games and the Andrew Mlangeni Golf Development Day.
Compatriots, a committee has been established to coordinate the participation of our performing arts legends in nation building activities in the country.
The Living Legends committee is chaired by playwright, Mr Welcome Msomi, working with music icon, Ms Letta Mbulu, as deputy chairperson.
We are also happy that musicians and actors, among others, heeded our call to unite and have formed the Creative Industries Federation of South Africa. The Presidency has established the Presidential Creative Industries Task Team to support our artists.
Compatriots, to achieve our objectives of creating jobs, reducing inequality and pushing back the frontiers of poverty, we need faster growth.
In the NDP, we set our aspirational target growth of 5% per year, which we had hoped to achieve by 2019.
Given the economic conditions I have painted earlier on, it is clear that we will not achieve that growth target at the time we had hoped to achieve it.
The tough global and domestic conditions should propel us to redouble our efforts, working together as all sectors. In this regard, it is important to act decisively to remove domestic constraints to growth.
We cannot change the global economic conditions, but we can do a lot to change the local conditions.
Let us work together to turn the situation around. It can be done.
I thank you.

Fellow South Africans,
Dumelang, Abusheni, Molweni,
On the 22nd of April, millions of South Africans went out to cast their votes. They exercised their democratic right spurred on by the desire to change their lives for the better.
They were encouraged by the vision of an inclusive society, a South Africa that belongs to all, a nation united in its diversity, a people working together for the greater good of all.
We are humbled by this decisive electoral mandate given by the people of our country, who have chosen their government in a most convincing manner.
Honourable Members,
It is thanks to the fact that we have a strong and fully functional constitutional democratic system, with solid institutions, that we overcame these difficulties smoothly and with dignity.
Today’s occasion is a celebration of what makes this democracy work. It is also a celebration of our culture of continuity and collective responsibility.
The continuity is also evident in the fact that former President Kgalema Motlanthe is now the Deputy President of the Republic, after a seamless transition, making us a unique country in many respects.
Fellow South Africans,
On the 9th of May, during the Presidential inauguration, we made a commitment to our people and the world that:
“For as long as there are South Africans who die from preventable disease;
For as long as there are workers who struggle to feed their families and who battle to find work;
For as long as there are communities without clean water, decent shelter or proper sanitation;
For as long as there are rural dwellers unable to make a decent living from the land on which they live;
For as long as there are women who are subjected to discrimination, exploitation or abuse;
For as long as there are children who do not have the means nor the opportunity to receive a decent education;
We shall not rest, and we dare not falter, in our drive to eradicate poverty".
In pursuit of these goals, our government has identified 10 priority areas, which form part of our Medium Term Strategic Framework for 2009 to 2014.
The programme is being introduced under difficult economic conditions.
The past year has seen the global economy enter a period of crisis unprecedented in recent decades.
While South Africa has not been affected to the extent that a number of other countries have, its effects are now being clearly seen in our economy. We have entered a recession.
We take as our starting point the framework for South Africa''''s response to the international economic crisis, concluded by government, labour and business in February this year. We must act now to minimise the impact of this downturn on those most vulnerable.
The lead sectors already identified are automobile, chemicals, metal fabrication, tourism, clothing and textiles as well as forestry. In addition, attention will also be paid to services, light manufacturing and construction amongst others, in the quest to create decent jobs.
We will support the work of the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to assist employers and workers to find alternatives to retrenchments through the relevant legal process.
The Industrial Development Corporation has developed a programme to fund companies in distress. We will also ensure that government buys more goods and services locally, without undermining our global competitiveness or pushing up costs beyond acceptable levels.
The lead sectors already identified are automobile, chemicals, metal fabrication, tourism, clothing and textiles as well as forestry. In addition, attention will also be paid to services, light manufacturing and construction amongst others, in the quest to create decent jobs.
As part of Phase 2 of the Expanded Public Works Programme, the Community Work Programme will be fast-tracked.
The economic downturn will affect the pace at which our country is able to address the social and economic challenges it faces. But it will not alter the direction of our development.
We take as our starting point the framework for South Africa''''s response to the international economic crisis, concluded by government, labour and business in February this year. We must act now to minimise the impact of this downturn on those most vulnerable.
We make a commitment that working together we will speed up economic growth and transform the economy to create decent work and sustainable livelihoods.
We will introduce a massive programme to build economic and social infrastructure. We will develop and implement a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land and agrarian reform and food security.
We will introduce a massive programme to build economic and social infrastructure. We will develop and implement a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land and agrarian reform and food security.
We will strengthen the skills and human resource base. We will improve the health profile of all South Africans.
Working together with all South Africans, we will intensify the fight against crime and corruption. We will build cohesive, caring and sustainable communities.
And, working with the people and supported by our public servants, we will build a developmental state, improve public services and strengthen democratic institutions.
The creation of decent work will be at the centre of our economic policies and will influence our investment attraction and job-creation initiatives.
In this regard, we will utilise state levers such as procurement, licensing and financial support to assist small
The lead sectors already identified are automobile, chemicals, metal fabrication, tourism, clothing and textiles as well as forestry. In addition, attention will also be paid to services, light manufacturing and construction amongst others, in the quest to create decent jobs.
In another intervention to create an enabling environment for investment, government will move towards a single integrated business registration system.
Another important element of our drive to create job opportunities is the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP). The initial target of one million jobs has been achieved.
While creating an environment for jobs and business opportunities, government recognises that some citizens will continue to require state social assistance. Social grants remain the most effective form of poverty alleviation. As of 31 March 2009, more than 13 million people received social grants, more than 8 million of whom are children.
We are mindful of the need to link the social grants to jobs or economic activity in order to encourage self-reliance amongst the able-bodied.
We reiterate our non-negotiables. Teachers should be in school, in class, on time, teaching, with no neglect of duty and no abuse of pupils! The children should be in class, on time, learning, be respectful of their teachers and each other, and do their homework.
Distinguished guests, as part of the second strategic priority we will continue with our programme to build economic and social infrastructure.
The newly-formed Infrastructure Development Cluster of government will ensure that the planned R787 billion infrastructure expenditure as provided for in the budget earlier this year is properly planned for and executed.
This funding includes allocations for the school building programme, public transport including the bus rapid transit system, housing, water and sanitation.
One of the biggest infrastructure investment projects is in the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup. We have, as government and the nation at large, pledged that the World Cup will leave a proud legacy from which our children and our communities will benefit for many years to come.
We are putting all systems in place to make the Confederations Cup, which kicks off on the 14th of June, a huge success.
In April this year, I gave an undertaking to the taxi industry leadership to defer negotiations relating to the operation of the Bus Integrated Rapid Transit system until after the elections.
We undertook to allow more time to deal properly with the concerns of the industry. On the 11th of June the Minister of Transport will resume discussions with the industry.
The meeting will kick-start a series of engagements with the stakeholders affected by the BRT system. We are confident that unresolved issues will be dealt with to the satisfaction of all parties.
Compatriots, Honourable Members,
Overall, we will ensure that the cost of telecommunications is reduced through the projects under way to expand broadband capacity.
As part of social infrastructure development we will provide suitably located and affordable housing and decent human settlements.
It is about transforming our cities and towns and building cohesive, sustainable and caring communities with closer access to work and social amenities, including sports and recreation facilities.
Working together with our people in the rural areas, we will ensure a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land and agrarian reform and food security, as our third priority.
I would like to use this opportunity to extend our condolences to the family of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Dirk du Toit, who passed away this week. His contribution will be sorely missed.
The lead sectors already identified are automobile, chemicals, metal fabrication, tourism, clothing and textiles as well as forestry. In addition, attention will also be paid to services, light manufacturing and construction amongst others, in the quest to create decent jobs.

Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
While having drawn the necessary lessons from earlier rural development initiatives, we have chosen the Greater Giyani Local Municipality in Limpopo as the first of the pilot projects for the campaign. Out of these projects will emerge lessons for the whole country.
In addition, we will work on the targeted renewal of rural towns, through grants such as the Neighbourhood Development Grant programme. In this way, areas around the towns will benefit from the economic boost.
Fellow citizens,
Education will be a key priority for the next five years. We want our teachers, learners and parents to work with government to turn our schools into thriving centres of excellence.
We reiterate our non-negotiables. Teachers should be in school, in class, on time, teaching, with no neglect of duty and no abuse of pupils! The children should be in class, on time, learning, be respectful of their teachers and each other, and do their homework.
To improve school management, formal training will be a pre-condition for promoting teachers to become principals or heads of department.
Fellow South Africans,
The target is to increase enrolment rates in secondary schools to 95 per cent by 2014. We are also looking at innovative measures to bring back into the system pupils who dropped out of school, and to provide support.
Honourable Members, we are very concerned about reports of teachers who sexually harass and abuse children, particularly girls.
We will ensure that the Guidelines on Sexual Harassment and Violence in Public Schools are widely disseminated, and that learners and teachers are familiar with and observe them.
To promote lifelong learning, the Adult Basic Education and Training Kha ri Gude programme will be intensified.
Compatriots, Honourable Members,
The Further Education and Training sector with its 50 colleges and 160 campuses nationally will be the primary site for skills development training.
We will improve the access to higher education of children from poor families and ensure a sustainable funding structure for universities.
Fellow South Africans,
We have set ourselves the goals of further reducing inequalities in health care provision, to boost human resource capacity, revitalise hospitals and clinics and step up the fight against the scourge of HIV and AIDS, TB and other diseases.
We must work together to improve the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan for the Treatment, Management and Care of HIV and AIDS so as to reduce the rate of new HIV infections by 50% by the year 2011.
Working together let us do more to promote quality health care, in line with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to halve poverty by 2014.
Fellow citizens,
Together we must do more to fight crime. Our aim is to establish a transformed, integrated, modernised, properly-resourced and well-managed criminal justice system.
It is also critically important to improve the efficiency of the courts and the performance of prosecutors and to enhance detective, forensic and intelligence services. This work has started in earnest, and it will be undertaken with new energy and vigour.
We changed the name of the relevant Ministry from Safety and Security to Police to emphasise that we want real operational energy in police work. This will contribute to the reduction of serious and violent crimes by the set target of 7% to 10% per annum.
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
Amongst other key initiatives, we will start the process of setting up a Border Management Agency; we shall intensify our efforts against cyber crime and identity theft, and improve systems in our jails to reduce repeat offending.
Fellow citizens,
The transformation should address key issues such as the enhancement of judicial independence, entrenching internal systems of judicial accountability as well as ensuring full access to justice by all.
The success of the democratic system as a whole depends on good relations of mutual respect and a spirit of partnership among the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. This is very important for our constitutional democracy.
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
We will pay particular attention to combating corruption and fraud in procurement and tender processes, application for drivers’ licences, social grants, IDs, and theft of police case dockets.
We must report crime and assist the police with information to catch wrongdoers. In this way, we will move forward towards a crime-free society.
Honourable Members, since 1994 we have sought to create a united cohesive society out of our fragmented past. We are called upon to continue this mission of promoting unity in diversity and to develop a shared value system, based on the spirit of community solidarity and a caring society.
Our shared value system should encourage us to become active citizens in the renewal of our country. We must build a common national identity and patriotism.
We must develop a common attachment to our country, our Constitution and the national symbols. In this spirit, we will promote the National Anthem and our country’s flag and all other national symbols.
We will ensure a common national approach to the changing of geographic and place names. This must provide an opportunity to involve all South Africans in forging an inclusive national identity, to deepen our understanding of our history and heritage.
Sport is a powerful nation-building tool. Working together we must support all our national teams from Bafana Bafana to the Proteas and the Springboks; from Banyana Banyana to Paralympians.
The country’s women’s netball team has done us proud by winning the Tri-Nations Netball Challenge. Congratulations to the Sevens Springboks who have become the IRB Sevens World Series Champions - and not forgetting the Blue Bulls who have won the Super 14 finals in a convincing fashion!
We take this opportunity to wish the Springboks well in the upcoming series against the British and Irish Lions.
It is clear that we need to invest on a large scale in sports development. We will speed up the revival of school sport and ensure that it forms part of the school curriculum. In addition we will ensure that the provision of sport facilities in poorer communities receives priority.
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
We have committed ourselves over the years to contribute to building a better Africa and a better world.
Equally important, and closer to home, is the strengthening of regional integration with particular emphasis on improving the political and economic integration of SADC, towards the AU goal of a Union government. We will establish a South African Development Partnership Agency to promote developmental partnerships with other countries on the continent.

We will establish a South African Development Partnership Agency to promote developmental partnerships with other countries on the continent.
South Africa will continue to assist in the reconstruction and development of the African continent especially in post-conflict situations. We will continue to encourage a peaceful and sustainable settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the two- state solution.
The plight of the Zimbabwean people has had a negative impact on the SADC region, especially South Africa. We call upon all peace-loving countries in the world to support the inclusive government to achieve economic recovery.
Allow me, distinguished guests, to pay tribute to the SA National Defence Force for their sterling role in peace building in the continent.
Through continental and regional bodies, we will work towards the entrenchment of democracy and the respect for human rights on the African continent.
We will continue to enhance relations with the developed North including the G8, and our strategic partnership with the European Union.
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
Amongst various programmes, we will implement the Water for Growth and Development strategy, which will strengthen water management. We will continue to improve our energy efficiency and reliance on renewable energy.
Compatriots, Honourable Members,
It is also critically important to improve the efficiency of the courts and the performance of prosecutors and to enhance detective, forensic and intelligence services. This work has started in earnest, and it will be undertaken with new energy and vigour.
We will also involve State-Owned Enterprises and Development Finance Institutions in the government planning processes and improve the monitoring and evaluation of their performance.
Honourable Members, fellow South Africans,
To ensure that all three spheres - local, provincial and national - improve service delivery, we will speed up the establishment of a single Public Service.
This administration will insist on putting people first in service delivery. We will ensure courteous and efficient service from front-counter staff in the provision of services in all government departments.
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,
The Agency will link up unemployed young graduates with economic opportunities; strengthen efforts to expand the National Youth Service Programme and support young entrepreneurs.
Speaker and Chairperson, Distinguished Guests,
An international campaign has been initiated by the Nelson Mandela Foundation and related organisations, called Mandela Day, which sums up what Tata stands for.
Madiba was politically active for 67 years, and on Mandela Day people all over the world, in the workplace, at home and in schools, will be called upon to spend at least 67 minutes of their time doing something useful within their communities, especially among the less fortunate.
Honourable Speaker and Chairperson Fellow South Africans,
We have presented to the nation our programme for the next five years. Attached to each commitment we make is a detailed project plan, with targets and critical milestones.
To be a citizen is not only about rights, it is also about responsibility, to make a contribution to make ours a better country.
In addition, Madiba taught us well that this country belongs to all, black and white. Working for reconciliation and unity will remain important as we move forward.
Since the implementation of our programme will take place in the face of the economic downturn, we will have to act prudently - no wastage, no rollovers of funds - every cent must be spent wisely and fruitfully. We must cut our cloth according to our size.
Fellow South Africans, working together we can do more to realise our common vision of a better and more prosperous nation!
This is the partnership we are calling for.

Dumelang, molweni, goeie naand, good evening, sanibonani nonke emakhaya!
We are impressed by the enthusiasm of the youth about the occasion.
The Governor of the Reserve Bank;
I stand before you this evening, 20 years since President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela walked out of prison.
South Africa is yet to acknowledge in full, the critical role played by the former President of the ANC, Comrade Oliver Tambo, who laid the foundation for this country to become a shining example of freedom and democracy.
You will recall that the masses of this country, in their different formations, responded with determination to the call to make the country ungovernable and apartheid unworkable.
We welcome in particular those who have travelled from abroad to be here, Helene Pastoors, Michael Dingake from Botswana, Mr Andimba Toivo ya Toivo of SWAPO in Namibia.
We are pleased to be joined by members of the legal team in the Rivonia Treason trial – Lord Joel Joffe, who is now based in London and Judge Arthur Chaskalson.
He was amongst other things, a member of the Rivonia defence team.
We extend our gratitude to our friends and comrades in the international community, for fighting side by side with us to achieve freedom.
South Africa is yet to acknowledge in full, the critical role played by the former President of the ANC, Comrade Oliver Tambo, who laid the foundation for this country to become a shining example of freedom and democracy.

Fellow South Africans,
South Africa is yet to acknowledge in full, the critical role played by the former President of the ANC, Comrade Oliver Tambo, who laid the foundation for this country to become a shining example of freedom and democracy.
It was this that laid the groundwork for the historic announcements by President FW de Klerk, 20 years ago.
On this great day, let me also acknowledge the role played by the late Ms Helen Suzman.
She was for a long time, a lone voice in Parliament, calling for change.
We also recognise the role of the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who also called for Madiba’s release, as well as that of other prisoners and the return of exiles.
These moments in our history demonstrate our ability to come together, even under the most difficult of circumstances, and to put the country’s interests first above all other interests.
Deur saam te werk, kan ons meer bereik.
Honourable Members,
During the course of this year, we will mark the centenary of the establishment of the Union of South Africa.
Significantly, the exclusion of black people from this Union was one of the chief reasons for the formation of the African National Congress in 1912.
As we mark this centenary later in the year, we should reflect on how far we have travelled as a country.
We recall the words of Madiba on his release, when he said:
“I stand before you, not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you, the people.
These words inspire us not to rest, until we achieve the ideals of a society free of poverty and deprivation.
In the two decades since the release of Madiba, our country has changed fundamentally.
As we celebrate Madiba’s release today, let us recommit ourselves to building a better future for all South Africans, black and white.
Honourable Members,
We called a joint sitting in the evening so that the majority in our country, workers and school children, can be part of the occasion.
We are impressed by the enthusiasm of the youth about the occasion.
Two hundred and sixty six children from all provinces participated in the pre-State of the Nation debate on the role of the youth in the fight against poverty.
We congratulate the overall winner, Charlotte Le Fleur of Worcester Secondary School and all the participants for the hard work.
Compatriots and friends,
We are pleased to announce that by the end of December, we had created more than 480 000 public works job opportunities, which is 97% of the target we had set.
To ensure a safety cushion for the poor, we brought social grant increases forward, and extended the child support grant to children over 14 years of age.
Government introduced a “training lay-off scheme” to allow workers the option of a period of training instead of retrenchment.
The nation will recall that during the 2009 State of the Nation Address, I announced that the Expanded Public Works Programme would create 500 000 work opportunities, by December 2009.
These are job opportunities created to provide unemployed people with an income, work experience, and training opportunities.
Honourable Members, Fellow South Africans,
We are pleased to announce that by the end of December, we had created more than 480 000 public works job opportunities, which is 97% of the target we had set.
We have identified the fight against hijacking, business and house robberies, as well as contact crimes such as murder, rape, and assault, as top priorities.
Honourable Members,
The labour statistics released on Tuesday, show that the economy is now creating jobs rather than shedding them.
Now is the time to lay the groundwork for stronger growth going forward, and for growth that gives rise to more jobs.
We are also collaborating with the DBSA and the Industrial Development Corporation, in a Public-Private Partnership programme to improve hospitals and provide finance for projects.
We will set up a guarantee fund of R1 billion to incentivise the private banking and housing sector, to develop new products to meet this housing demand.
Among other things, this will look at the participation of independent power producers, and protecting the poor from rising electricity prices.
We will establish an independent system operator, separate from Eskom Holdings.
To ensure the promotion of an inclusive economy, to aid growth and development, we have established the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Advisory Council, chaired by the President.
This includes local infrastructure and literacy projects, home-based care, school maintenance and early childhood development initiatives.
We have directed the Agency to work faster to establish its structures, throughout the country, so that it can assist us to mainstream youth development programmes within government.
Honourable Members,
We said it would be a state that responds to the needs and aspirations of the people, and which performs better and faster.
The defining feature of this administration will be that it knows where people live, understands their needs, and responds faster.
We are building a performance-oriented state, by improving planning as well as performance monitoring and evaluation.
We are pleased to announce a new way of doing things in government.
It will outline what is to be done, how, by whom, within what time period and using what measurements and resources.
As you are aware, we are committed to five priorities:
education, health, rural development and land reform, creating decent work, and fighting crime.
In our 2010 programme, we want to improve the ability of our children to read, write and count in the foundation years.
From this year onwards, all grade 3, 6 and 9 students will write literacy and numeracy tests that are independently moderated.
We aim to increase the number of matric students who are eligible for university admission to 175 000 a year by 2014.
We welcome last month’s statement by the three teacher unions, NAPTOSA, SADTU and SAOU, reaffirming their commitment to the Quality Learning and Teaching Campaign from the beginning of 2010.
Honourable Members,
We therefore plan to increase the training of 16-25 year olds in further education and training facilities.
We have also set ambitious targets for skills development, to produce additional engineers and technicians, and to increase the number of qualified mathematics and science teachers.
Another key outcome is to ensure a long and healthy life for all South Africans.
This includes building and upgrading hospitals and clinics, and further improving the working conditions of health care workers.
We are also collaborating with the DBSA and the Industrial Development Corporation, in a Public-Private Partnership programme to improve hospitals and provide finance for projects.
Honourable Members,
We are therefore making interventions to lower maternal mortality rates, to reduce new HIV infections and to effectively treat HIV and tuberculosis.
We will implement all the undertakings made on World Aids Day relating to new HIV prevention and treatment measures.
Fellow South Africans,
We are implementing plans to increase the number of police men and women by 10% over the next three years.
We have identified the fight against hijacking, business and house robberies, as well as contact crimes such as murder, rape, and assault, as top priorities.
Our Inter-Ministerial Committee on Corruption is looking at ways to decisively defeat corruption.
Compatriots and esteemed guests,
Municipalities must improve the provision of housing, water, sanitation, electricity, waste management and roads.
After the Balfour visit, we sent a nine member Ministerial team to visit the area to address the issues that had been raised by the community.
We are also collaborating with the DBSA and the Industrial Development Corporation, in a Public-Private Partnership programme to improve hospitals and provide finance for projects.
During this year of action, let us work together to make local government everybody’s business.
We are working to upgrade well-located informal settlements and provide proper service and land tenure to at least 500 000 households by 2014.
We will set up a guarantee fund of R1 billion to incentivise the private banking and housing sector, to develop new products to meet this housing demand.
Municipalities must improve the provision of housing, water, sanitation, electricity, waste management and roads.
In this regard, we launched the first pilot site of the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme in Giyani, Limpopo in August last year.
We are working to upgrade well-located informal settlements and provide proper service and land tenure to at least 500 000 households by 2014.
Our success in this area will be measured by the increase in the number of small scale farmers that become economically viable.
We have also set ambitious targets for skills development, to produce additional engineers and technicians, and to increase the number of qualified mathematics and science teachers.
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
Yet we still lose a lot of water through leaking pipes and inadequate infrastructure.
Honourable Members,
The South African public can look forward to an even further reduction of broadband, cell phone, landline and public phone rates.
Together with Brazil, India and China, and joined by the United States which represented the developed world, we made a significant contribution to the accord adopted at the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit in December last year.
As South Africa we have voluntarily committed ourselves to specific emission reduction targets, and will continue working on our long term climate change mitigation strategy.
Honourable Members,
We will support efforts to speed up the political and economic integration of the SADC region, and promote intra-regional trade and investment.
Fellow South Africans,
Government is already working on the development and implementation of a public service development programme, which will set the norms and standards for public servants in all spheres.
Honourable Members,
This week, we terminated 32 687 fraudulent social grants payments, valued at R180 million.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
As you are aware, we introduced the Presidential Hotline to make government and the Presidency more accessible to the public, and to help unblock service delivery blockages.
We can mention Mrs Buziwe Ngaleka of Mount Frere, whose call about her late husband’s pension was the first we took on the first day of the service.
We also have among us Mr Nkululeko Cele, who was helped to obtain identity documents which allowed him to enroll at Tshwane University of Technology.
From these and other examples, we identify weaknesses that should be rectified by various spheres of government.
Through the Speaker, we have invited a multiparty delegation from Parliament to visit the call centre, so that MPs can get a first hand account of the work done.
Compatriots and friends,
I have outlined the main elements of our plans for 2010, our collective commitment as government to the people of South Africa.
Honourable Members,
It provides an opportunity to recognise the important contribution of the Indian community in the fields of labour, business, science, sports, religion, arts, culture and the achievement and consolidation of our democracy.
Compatriots and friends,
Let me take this opportunity to once again extend our heartfelt condolences to the government and people of Haiti on the monumental tragedy that has befallen them.
I would like to especially recognise one South African who never fails to assist in times of disasters, and helps us to promote the vision of a caring society.
Fellow South Africans,
We wish the LOC Chairperson Irvin Khoza, CEO Danny Jordaan and Bafana Bafana coach Carlos Alberto Parreira all the best for the months ahead.
South Africa is yet to acknowledge in full, the critical role played by the former President of the ANC, Comrade Oliver Tambo, who laid the foundation for this country to become a shining example of freedom and democracy.
Fellow South Africans,
As we celebrate Madiba’s release today, we recommit ourselves to reconciliation, national unity, non-racialism and building a better future together as South Africans, black and white.
We are guided by what Madiba said in the dock, that:
Let us pursue the ideal for which Madiba has fought his entire life - the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.
Inspired by our icon Madiba, it is my honour to dedicate this 2010 State of the Nation Address, to all our heroes and heroines, sung and unsung, known and unknown.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
1. Implementation of Government Programmes
1.1. Cabinet welcomes President Jacob Zuma’s 2017 State of the Nation Address (SoNA) under the theme "Radical Transformation of the Economy”. This was at the halfway mark of this Fifth Administration’s term of office which saw 2017 being declared the Year of Oliver Reginald Tambo and the year of deepening unity.
President Jacob Zuma outlined progress we are making in realising our vision of a National Democratic Society and the key actions required to move us closer and faster to a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous society.
The President reflected on the implementation of Government’s programme and announced concrete actionable plans for effective implementation of the National Development Plan, which underpins the Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2014-2019. SoNA 2017 clearly demonstrated that consolidated efforts by government, business and labour in implementing the Nine Point Plan are beginning to have an impact. Cabinet reiterates the President’s call to intensify efforts aimed at driving radical economic transformation and efforts to fast-track implementation.
Cluster Ministers are in the process of post-SoNA media briefings to elaborate on Government’s 2017/18 Programme of Action. The 2017/18 Budget Speech will further map out the allocation of resources to the various government programmes as highlighted by the President.
1.2. The outcomes of the Investing in African Mining Conference that was held in Cape Town demonstrates the country’s competitive advantage in the areas of mining and related fields.
The mining sector remains the cornerstone of the South African economy contributing 8 per cent to the country’s GDP, employing around 460 000 people and earning foreign exchange. South Africa continues to be a productive and rewarding destination for investors in mining with an estimated $2.5 to 3 trillion in non-energy mineral reserves still in-situ.
The amendments to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act by June 2017 and gazetting of the revised Mining Charter by March 2017 contribute to the creation of an enabling regulatory environment which encourages investment, trade and enterprise development in an equitable and socially responsible manner.
1.3. The Indaba was bolstered by Invest Africa which is a platform for business leaders, investors and entrepreneurs to gain insight and exposure to information and opportunities from Africa.
1.4. Cabinet welcomes the Settlement Agreement reached between the construction industry and Government, also known as the Voluntary Rebuilding Programme (VRP).
This Agreement sets company-level targets for transformation, either through the sale of a minimum of 40% of shares to black South Africans or through partnerships with smaller black-owned construction companies, to help increase their turnover to 25% of the listed company turnover, over a seven-year period.
This is the most far-reaching sector agreement on transformation reached with government to date and can help to give effect to Government's vision of radical economic transformation. It is also a model that can be drawn on for transformation in other sectors.
Cabinet congratulates the signatories to the agreement and urges all other construction companies in the sector who are not currently parties to the agreement, to follow this lead and join in the partnership that is being built, through making similar commitments in order to further boost the transformation of the sector.
1.5. Cabinet applauds all social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) on the historic agreement on the introduction of a National Minimum Wage of R20 an hour with effect from no later than May 2018.
The agreement on a National Minimum Wage and other measures to strengthen labour stability and collective bargaining is an important step in creating a more equal, just and prosperous society as envisaged in the National Development Plan (NDP).
The national minimum wage, which is a floor below which no worker may be paid, will significantly improve the lives of millions of low paid workers and begin to address the challenge of wage inequality.
The wage has been set at an initial level that will make a real difference in the lives of ordinary South Africans while minimising any adverse effects on employment. Businesses that are unable to afford the national minimum wage may apply for a temporary exemption, while measures are being considered to assist fragile sectors of the economy.
1.6. The unemployment challenge remains a top government priority and all programmes and interventions are geared towards turning the situation around, especially in this tough economic environment. Cabinet welcomes the increase in jobs in the economy over the fourth quarter of 2016 when 235 000 jobs were created, according to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey. The increase was largely driven by employment in the country’s services sector, followed by transport and manufacturing.
The growth in jobs over the quarter resulted in a slight decrease in the unemployment rate to 26.5%.
1.7. Cabinet thanks all parents, teachers, lecturers and administrators on the successful start of the 2017 academic year. Education is one of our key priorities and central to achieving Vision 2030 of the National Development Plan (NDP).
1.8. Cabinet commends the dedication of the Class of 2016 as we celebrate the achievement rate increase from 70.7 per cent in 2015 to 72.5 per cent in 2016. Cabinet wishes all learners well and looks forward to further improvement in the achievement rate from the Class of 2017.
Cabinet also commends the learners who will be sitting for the supplementary matric examination between 11 February 2017 and 18 March 2017 for their perseverance.
1.9. As part of government efforts to galvanise society to protect the right to education, the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation will convene the National Development Plan Back to School Izimbizo on 25 February 2017 in all provinces. Education is the foundation for all government programmes and all Members of the Executive will be participating.
Community members are invited to join members of Cabinet, Members of Parliament, Premiers and leaders in local government as they visit schools, tertiary institutions and other educational centres.
1.10. In line with the prescripts of the Freedom Charter that “higher education and technical training shall be opened to all by means of state allowances and scholarships awarded on the basis of merit”, Government through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme is funding more than 20 000 new students at 23 universities.
This is in addition to the 107 000 returning students from 25 universities and 737 747 returning students from 35 Technical and Vocational Education and Training colleges.
1.11. Our government continues to explore various models in finding sustainable solutions to funding and opening up opportunities for the poor and the middle-class to pursue post school education and training. The Ikusasa Student Financial Aid Programme (ISFAP) is an innovative public private partnership led by the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) that assists the “missing middle”.
The project is being piloted with six universities and one technical and vocational education training (TVET) college and will be funding the studies of approximately 1 500 students studying in a number of general formative degrees, as well as seven professional qualifications and one artisan qualification for the duration of their studies.
They will also receive academic support, social support, life skills training, mentoring and medical support where required. More than R200 million will be needed to enable the pilot to succeed and will mainly be sourced from the private sector.
1.12. The second World Skills South Africa Competition which is being hosted by the Department of Higher Education and Training at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban from 13 to 17 February 2017, celebrates the talent of young artisans and technicians in the country.
It also serves as an advocacy programme to highlight the importance of the artisanal sector in the country’s economy. Winners go on to represent South Africa at the World Skills International Competition in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates in October 2017.
1.13. President Jacob Zuma’s unannounced visit to Nyanga Police station in Cape Town coincided with the release of the 2015/16 Victims of Crime Survey by Statistics South Africa. The successful visit, as part of the Presidential Siyahlola Monitoring programme, gained first-hand account of work that is being done to fight crime in the area. Departments from the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster are in the process of attending to challenges faced by the Police Station.
1.14. The Victims of Crime Survey is important as it guides government in formulating its policies in the fight against crime. This is in line with the government priority that All People in South Africa Are and Feel Safe. The results assist in guiding further work that needs to be done, to match the good news on achievements over the last five years, with perceptions and experiences of citizens.
2. Cabinet decisions
2.1. The Implementation Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Environmental Governance in the Mining Sector, included the management response and improvement plan by the Department of Environmental Affairs
The National Environmental Management Act, 1998 defines the environmental management approach that should be integrated across all sectors, including the mining sector. The objective is to ensure that the environmental impacts of mining activities are effectively mitigated or managed. The evaluation assessed the relevance and effectiveness of the legislation and its implementation to achieve this objective.
Cabinet supports the ‘One Environment System’ as proposed in the Improvement Plan with a mandate to consider additional streamlining measures such as further alignment of Specific Environmental Management Acts. Cabinet also supports a discussion on mine closures to ensure environmental protection and to reduce socio-economic risk to surrounding communities.
2.2. The 2015/16 Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive Annual Report which is being submitted to Parliament, shows how the R&D Tax Incentive programme is promoting increased private sector R&D investment. This is required to increase the economy’s capacity to boost employment creation, as well as to increase positive spillovers through knowledge transfer and skills development.
From March 2015 to February 2016, the Department of Science and Technology received 189 R&D tax incentive applications from 147 companies.
This increased the total number of companies participating in the incentive programme since its inception in November 2006, to 962. In this period the National Treasury estimates that just over R6 billion in tax revenue was foregone as a result of the R&D tax incentive. Over the same period the incentive supported about R36.1 billion in R&D expenditure.
Of the 962 companies, 47% are Small and Medium Enterprises, 12% are large enterprises (turnover R41 million to R100 million); 32% are very large enterprises (R100 million and above); and 8% did not disclose their turnover size.
2.3. Cabinet approved the introduction of a process for the coordination of the government’s budget for Research & Development (R&D) activities.
The National Development Plan notes that R&D and innovation have a key role to play in improving the competitiveness of the South African economy and in supporting socio-economic development and employment.
South Africa’s critical national scientific infrastructure is obsolete and in urgent need of technological upgrading and modernising to sustain effective service delivery. Such infrastructure is large and expensive, and would require coordinated investment across departments.
The proposed budget coordination will be phased in over the medium term 2016/17 and 2019/20.
2.4. Cabinet was briefed on the progress made in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and MeerKAT projects, the planned establishment of the merged South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the hosting of the Hydrogen Epoch of Re-ionisation Array (HERA) telescope on the SKA site.
The SKA and MeerKAT constitute one of eighteen Strategic Infrastructure Projects of the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission. These mega infrastructure projects contribute to the National Development Plan through their potential to promote economic development, unlock economic opportunities and promote job creation.
Good progress is being made on the preparations for SKA-1 in South Africa including the acquisition of land and negotiations on the international treaty and the procurement process. In its ten years the SKA SA Human Capital Development Programme awarded over 800 bursaries, with extensive support to schools in Carnarvon.
The MeerKAT “first light” image of the radio sky produced with only 16 antennae shows more than 13003 radio galaxies in the distant universe, demonstrating that it is the best radio telescope in the Southern Hemisphere and should be the world’s best telescope of its kind, once completed. The full complement of 64 antennae will be installed and operational by March 2018, and is being built with 75% local content so as to prepare the local industry for deeper participation.
HERA is a complementary scientific experiment to advance understanding of early galaxy formation and if funded mainly by the National Science Foundation of the United States in partnership with Cambridge University.
The concept of a single radio astronomy observatory, to be known as the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory will consolidate the different projects and activities of the South African radio astronomy landscape. There are efficiency gains to be made with a single new National Facility under the National Research Foundation.
2.5. The White Paper on National Civil Aviation Policy, which promotes and enhances civil aviation safety, security and environmental compliance, was approved. It also promotes the national interest of South Africa and facilitates the expansion of trade and tourism. Further it promotes the development of an efficient and productive aviation industry, which is capable of competing both locally and internationally.
2.6. Cabinet also approved the National Airports Development Plan which was initiated by the White Paper on National Civil Aviation Policy to address the gaps between the current airport network and the future desired state.
It will guide and support both overall network planning and the development of individual airports integrated within their broader spatial and transport contexts, in consultation with key airport stakeholders.
Airport infrastructure is an integral part of the South African transport system and contributes to the socio-economic development of the country by facilitating domestic and international tourism and trade.
2.7. The draft Comprehensive Maritime Transport Policy 2016, was approved, for public comments.
This provides a national framework to guide the integrated governance, growth, development and transformation of the maritime sector, with a view to unlock the maritime sectors’ full potential and enhance its contribution to the socio-economic development objectives of the country, while contributing to international trade.
This is in line with Government priorities relating to Operation Phakisa on growing the Oceans Economy and broader goals from the National Development Plan 2030 and the National Infrastructure Plan to promote economic growth and to boost job creation.
3. Bills
3.1. Submission of the Draft Marine Spatial Planning Bill, 2016 to Parliament. The Bill provides a legal framework for the development of a marine spatial planning system that promotes economic growth; and is facilitated by coordinating planning across multiple sectors.
It will promote good ocean governance by ensuring involvement of all sectors in joint management and planning in the ocean space. It will also facilitate: conflict resolution (amongst the users of space and regulatory authorities); enhancement of information; knowledge and management in South African ocean space.
The Bill will work towards sustainable development, rather than only conservation or environmental protection, with a view to contribute to more general social and economic objectives. It is also a key initiative of the first Operation Phakisa (Ocean Economy) to unlock our economic potential.
3.2. Submission of the Agricultural Products Standards Amendment Bill to Parliament. The Bill amends the Agricultural Products Standards Act, 1990 (Act No. 119 of 1990)
The Bill aims to strengthen the regulatory framework for agricultural production, health and food safety of certain agricultural products. Such a regulatory framework promotes food safety and creates an enabling environment for increased and sustainable production. This will increase fair trade practices and consumer protection.
3.3. Publication of the Draft Electronic Deeds Registration Systems Bill, 2016, for public comment.
The Bill facilitates the development, establishment and maintenance of an electronic deeds registration system that will provide, amongst other things, for the effective registration of large volumes of deeds as a result of our Government’s land reform measures, improved turn-around times for providing registered deeds and documents to clients; provide country-wide access to deeds registration services; enhanced accuracy of examination and registration; availability of information to the public; and security features including confidentiality.
This also supports the National Development Plan call for measures to be implemented in all government departments and sectors that effectively manage information and technology to ensure that South Africa does not fall victim to a ‘digital divide’.
4. Issues in the Environment
4.1. Cabinet joins President Jacob Zuma in extending condolences to the families and friends of mentally ill patients who died in Gauteng. Government, and society at large, has a responsibility to protect and care for the vulnerable. Cabinet commends the Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi for appointing the Health Ombudsman to investigate all wrong doings committed by health institutions and health practitioners.
Further, the action being taken by the Premier of Gauteng, David Makhura, based on the report of the Health Ombudsman, is welcomed. Cabinet further calls on Premier Makhura to ensure that appropriate disciplinary action is taken against all who may have conducted themselves improperly or negligently.
4.2. Cabinet was concerned about the disorderly behaviour displayed at the Opening of Parliament which not only infringe on the rights of others in Parliament, but on the rights of all South Africans. Parliament is one of South Africa’s founding democratic institutions, established by the Constitution, to uphold the Bill of Rights and account to the people of South Africa – all of whom have entrusted us with the responsibility of leading them towards a better life. Members of Parliament, as representatives of the people must put the interests of all South Africans first and reassert the role of this important institution.
4.3. Cabinet was apprised on Tropical Cyclone Dineo, with South Africa set to experience severe storms and heavy rains starting from today, Thursday, 16 February 2017 until the weekend - Sunday 19 February 2017. The Cyclone will affect Mpumalanga, the extreme northern parts of Kwa Zulu Natal and Limpopo. This will mostly affect – Kruger National Park, Enhlanzeni, Vhembe, Mopani and Waterberg district Municipalities. The eastern parts of Limpopo may also experience high levels of rainfall on Friday, estimated at 200 mm over a 24-hour period.
The National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) and the National Joint Operations Centre (NATJOC) comprising of various government departments and institutions have assessed the situation and activated three Provincial Joint Operations Centres (PROVJOC) in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal. This multi-sectoral approach will assist where the need arises to ensure safety of communities and to minimise the impact.
Government is appealing to all affected communities to take extra care ahead of this coming cyclone. Communities are discouraged from crossing flooded roads, bridges and rivers. We also urge parents, care givers and guardians to ensure the safety of their children during the storms. Communities must work together to ensure the safety of people. Please listen for warnings and information on Tropical Cyclone Dineo which is being broadcast across all local radio stations.
4.4. Cabinet fully supports the intervention and community engagement by the government delegation, being led by Minister of Home Affairs, Malusi Gigaba, and the Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane to engage on issues affecting communities in the area, in particular matters around policing and the alleged illegal activities of migrants.
Cabinet supports the Minister’s call for “a whole of state approach” to these legitimate issues raised by communities, which will be addressed through: the establishment of a Border Management Authority that will help in better managing our borders, documentation of all people living in South Africa, effective policing and ensuring compliance to the laws and the Constitution of the Republic by citizens and foreign nationals.
Cabinet gives full support to the security cluster, to ensure that these matters are resolved to the satisfaction of the South African public. This will require better dialogue around policing between communities and the authorities. Cabinet further wishes to call for responsible public comments by all leaders and representatives, issues must be handled in a responsible manner.
4.5. In a separate incident, Cabinet condemns the attacks on fans, players and officials during the Absa Premiership match between Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates at Loftus Versfeld which left 13 people injured.
Such behaviour and acts of hooliganism brings the sport into disrepute, reflects negatively on the country and requires stringent action from soccer authorities that must act swiftly to ensure such acts are not repeated.
5. Sympathy and congratulatory messages
5.1. Cabinet expresses its condolences to family, friends and the rugby fraternity on the passing of former Springbok captain Joost van der Westhuizen. President Jacob Zuma had also declared a Special Provincial Official Funeral to commemorate the South African rugby legend.
5.2. Cabinet welcomes the election of Chad's Foreign Minister, Moussa Faki Mahamat, as the new Chairperson of the African Union Commission, replacing South Africa's Dr Nkosazana-Dlamini Zuma.
5.3. Cabinet welcomes the appointment of Minister Jeff Radebe, as a South African ambassador for Global Citizens, and will form part of a movement of eight million Global Citizens across the world. This is a network of top celebrities, policymakers, business leaders, activists and stakeholders committed to tackling the world's biggest challenges and ending extreme poverty. It’s work is aligned to the National Development Plan goals of ending poverty and reducing inequality, and benefits the development framework for the continent - Agenda 2063.
5.4. The Minister of Science and Technology, Naledi Pandor, is also being honoured by the American Association for the Advancement of Science for her role in science diplomacy in Boston, United States, today.
5.5. Cabinet congratulates the winners of the annual Ubuntu Awards, hosted by the Department of International Relations and Cooperation to celebrate South African citizens who play an active role in projecting a positive image of South Africa internationally. These included: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela; Siyabulela Xuza; Pretty Yende; Esther Mahlangu; Gertrude Shope; and Chinese Ambassador Tian Xuejun. Sasol, Babies Behind Bars and the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation were also recognised.
5.6. Cabinet also congratulates the South African Sevens team also known as the Blitzboks for winning the Sydney Rugby Sevens World Series tournament. This is their second win since the beginning of the year after the Blitzboks won the HSBC Wellington Sevens in January.

Fellow South Africans,
Dumelang, good evening, goeie naand, molweni, thobela,
Thank you Honourable Speaker of the National Assembly and the Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP, for this opportunity to share with fellow South Africans and international guests our review and programme of action for this year.
I called this Joint Sitting in the evening again so that all, including students and workers, can have an opportunity at first hand to listen to their government speak on issues affecting their lives.
We thank the Presiding Officers for allowing us this opportunity.
Let me also, on behalf of government, welcome the Members of Parliament back to this beautiful mother city of Cape Town.
We would like to thank all South Africans who contributed to this State of the Nation Address through mainstream media, social media such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as direct contact.
The inputs have been very helpful.
Tomorrow will be 21 years since the release of our beloved President Nelson Mandela from prison.
It was a historic and very special moment for our country, which demonstrated the victory of our people over tyranny and apartheid oppression.
The events of that day prepared the ground for the implementation of our vision of a free, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic, united and prosperous South Africa.
We have entered the 17th year of freedom, ready to continue the drive to make South Africa a successful and prosperous country, building on the foundation that was laid by President Mandela.
As we mark this milestone, we extend the nation’s good wishes to Tata Madiba and his family, and wish him a speedy recovery.
Fellow South Africans,
We need to accept the reality that President Mandela, who is loved by all of us, young and old, men and women, black and white, is not young anymore.
We should allow him to do so with dignity, and give the family and the medical team the space to look after him, on our behalf, in privacy.
We owe him that much given his love of this country and its people, and the contribution he has made to South Africa, Africa and the world.
We thank the family, the Nelson Mandela Foundation and the medical team for the sterling work that they are doing, in caring for a global icon, that we are so proud to call our own.
We want to assure the nation that Madiba is receiving very good medical care, and is comfortable.
TOGETHER WE HAVE ACHIEVED MUCH
Fellow South Africans,
We continue to make steady progress as we work towards a more prosperous society. The political foundation is solid.
We have well-established institutions that support democracy and protect the rights of our citizens, such as the Office of the Public Protector, the South African Human Rights Commission, the Office of the Auditor General, the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities and the Gender Commission.
Without fail, national general elections are held every five years to enable South Africans to choose a government of their choice, run by our efficient Independent Electoral Commission.
We have an independent judiciary which is a trusted final arbiter in all disputes in our society. We have a media whose freedom is enshrined in the Constitution.
On basic services, we are also making progress. More than 400 000 additional people were served with basic water supply last year. About 81% of the country is electrified as compared to 63% in the year 2000.
The crime statistics show a decrease in most crimes, particularly armed robberies, housebreakings and business robberies as well as contact crimes, for example, the murder rate declined by 8, 6 percent in the past year.
We are making a difference in education, as evidenced by the significant increase in the matric pass rate last year, and the interest displayed by the youth in education around the country.
Honourable Members,
Close to 15 million South Africans obtain social grants from the State. We will phase in the extension of the Child Support Grant to cover eligible children under the age of 18 years.
Since we are building a developmental and not a welfare state, the social grants will be linked to economic activity and community development, to enable short-term beneficiaries to become self-supporting in the long run.
Honourable Members,
The Budget deficit is set to decline from the current 6.7% to between 3 and 4% by 2013.
Exchange control reforms that were announced in the Medium Term Budget Policy statement last year are being implemented. Further information will be provided by the Minister of Finance in the Budget Speech.
The 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup was undoubtedly the most exciting project in 2010.
On the international front, we are greatly honoured to join the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa forum. It is an important bloc of emerging economies. We look forward to the inaugural meeting of BRICS in April in China.
We have taken up our non-permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, which we will use to promote the African agenda as well as peace and security in Africa and the world.
We have come a long way. We have achieved a lot, but challenges still remain.
Working together we will achieve much more.
BUILDING A MORE PROSPEROUS SOCIETY
Honourable Members,
While many South Africans celebrate the delivery of houses, electricity or water, there are yet many others who are still waiting.
The legacy of decades of apartheid underdevelopment and colonial oppression cannot be undone in only 17 years.
But we are forging ahead, determined to achieve our mission of building a better life for all.
Bongokuhle Miya wrote on the Presidency Facebook page that his hometown Umzimkhulu is in an appalling condition, with burst sewerage pipes everywhere, no drainage system and domestic animals that are roaming around town.
He writes: “If the Government, which is doing very well, could just pay much more attention, with a bit of urgency to such areas”.
Indeed, we agree service delivery should move faster.
In the past year we have visited many villages, townships and suburbs. Their message is consistent.
They appreciate progress made, request faster delivery and state their commitment to work with government to achieve more.
Given the work that must still be done, we decided in 2009 to focus on five priorities. These are education, health, rural development and agrarian reform, taking forward the fight against crime and creating decent work.
However, we are concerned that unemployment and poverty persist despite the economic growth experienced in the past 10 years.
To address these concerns, we have declared 2011 a year of job creation through meaningful economic transformation and inclusive growth.
We urge every sector and every business entity, regardless of size, to focus on job creation. Every contribution counts in this national effort.
I will provide just a broad outline of our programme of action in this address.
Ministers will announce their jobs targets and more specific details per sector, in their forthcoming Budget Vote Speeches.
All government departments will align their programmes with the job creation imperative. The provincial and local government spheres have also been requested to do the same.
The programmes of State Owned Enterprises and development finance institutions should also be more strongly aligned to the job creation agenda.
Honourable Members,
Research has indicated that we can create jobs in six priority areas. These are infrastructure development, agriculture, mining and beneficiation, manufacturing, the green economy and tourism.
We cannot create these jobs alone. We have to work with business, labour and the community constituencies.
One key example is the work done by the Presidential Response Framework to the International Economic Crisis team, comprising government, business, labour and community sectors.
Amongst the key achievements of the team, South Africa introduced its first ever training layoff scheme to provide alternatives to retrenchments.
Another intervention included financial support for firms in distress, which saved about seven thousand jobs. We thank the team for their sterling work, and look forward to ongoing collaboration.
We are pleased to announce the establishment of a jobs fund of 9 billion rand over the next three years to finance new job-creation initiatives.
In addition, the Industrial Development Corporation has set aside R10 billion over the next five years for investment in such economic activities with a high jobs potential.
It is also my pleasure Honourable Members, to announce R20 billion in tax allowances or tax breaks to promote investments, expansions and upgrades in the manufacturing sector.
For a project to qualify, the minimum investment must be R200 million for new projects, and R30 million for expansion and upgrades.
The programme will provide an allowance of up to R900 million in tax deductible allowances rand for new investors and R550 million for upgrades and expansions.
Honourable Members,
The small business sector is a critical component of the job creation drive.
We will continue to provide financial and non-financial support to small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs), small scale agriculture as well as cooperatives.
We need to cut administrative costs, avoid duplication and direct more resources to small business.
We are therefore considering merging the three agencies Khula, the SA Micro-Finance Apex Fund and the IDC’s small business funding into a single unit.
The Department of Trade and Industry payment hotline received about 20 000 calls in the last financial year, and the value of payments facilitated was R210 million.
Other departments have launched their own initiatives, for example the Re Ya Patala (We Pay) initiative of the Department of Public Works.
We are continuing with legislative reforms to make it easier to register businesses and also to strengthen the Competition Act to open the market to new participants.
Honourable Members,
The mineral wealth of our country is a national asset and a common heritage that belongs to all South Africans, with the State as the custodian.
South Africa has significant mining assets, currently valued at 2.5 trillion US dollars.
By 2009, the mining industry contributed more than thirty percent to the country’s total export revenue, and employed 2.9% of the country’s economically active population.
Estimates suggest that our mineral resources are expected to be exploitable for over a century to come.
To take advantage of that potential, government has endorsed the African Exploration, Mining and Finance Corporation as the State Owned Mining Company, that will undertake the mining of minerals of strategic significance.
One of government’s priorities this year is also to finalise and adopt the beneficiation strategy as the official policy of government, so that we can start reaping the full benefits of our commodities.
Honourable Members,
In communications, we have committed to convert our television and radio signals from the analogue platform to the more advanced digital signal which will enable quality pictures and sound.
Jobs will be created in manufacturing, packaging, distribution and installation during this period.
Honourable Speaker and National Chairperson,
We are pleased with the success of our tourism sector, especially given that sixteen tourists create one job in our country.
More than 7, 3 million tourists arrived in South Africa last year, as compared to about 6.3 million in 2009. For further growth, we will strengthen existing markets while exploring the emerging economies.
Our country also continues to be a popular destination for international gatherings.
In July, we will host a high level sports gathering in Durban, the 123rd International Olympic Committee General Assembly Session.
We have already secured ninety five meetings and conferences between 2010 and 2016.
To further boost our tourism potential, we will amongst other measures, look into flexible visa requirements, improved landing slots at foreign airports as well as improved tourism infrastructure.
Linked to tourism, we will continue to develop the cultural industries sector, which contributes about R2 billion to the Gross Domestic Product.
We have also seen the value of events such as the Cape Town International Jazz Festival which, contributed more than R475 million to the economy of Cape Town and created 2 000 jobs in 2010.
We also wish to extend a special mention to the popular Cape Minstrels Carnival, which brightens up this city every year on the 2nd of January, celebrating the freeing of slaves.
Honourable Members,
Our infrastructure development programme enables us to expand access to basic services and to improve the quality of life.
This includes projects for the provision of water, electricity and housing.
Energy security is critical for economic development and job creation. To ensure the security of electricity supply for the country, Eskom has invested more than R75 billion, mainly on the new stations Medupi, Kusile and Ingula, as well as the return to service and transmission of other projects.
We must all save energy so that we do not have to resort to load shedding again as a saving measure.
This year we will start procuring power from Renewable Energy Power Producers, which will demonstrate our commitment to renewable energy.
Honourable Members,
The construction industry is a known driver for work opportunities. There are 1.2 million households living in the country’s 2 700 informal settlements.
By the year 2014, 400 000 of the said households should have security of tenure and access to basic services.
We will also improve the delivery of rental accommodation as some people coming to urban areas do not intend to settle permanently.
This should be welcome news to citizens such as Portia Busisiwe Mrwetyana who wrote on our Facebook page about inequalities in Bekkersdal, where an informal settlement which has no services, lies alongside a suburb across the road with all amenities.
Government will spend R2,6 billion on water services this year. Among the priority areas are the provinces of Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape where there are still high numbers of people without safe drinking water.
We noted the requests from many contributors to this address, for government to fix potholes.
Our Expanded Public Works Programme aims to create 4, 5 million work opportunities, and more than a million opportunities have been created already since the beginning of Phase 2. Part of the programme focuses on repairing our roads networks.
To further boost our tourism potential, we will amongst other measures, look into flexible visa requirements, improved landing slots at foreign airports as well as improved tourism infrastructure.
We will develop infrastructure that will boost our agricultural sector, while also helping to create jobs.
Water reservoirs, windmills and irrigation schemes will be rehabilitated. Crops, livestock as well as grazing will be protected with the installation of fences.
These projects will enhance food security and create work opportunities for many, especially women in rural areas.
The bid has already provided 800 construction job opportunities in the Northern Cape and will create a further 100 jobs this year.
Our job creation drive should also enhance youth development.
The National Youth Development agency is in discussion with state organs and the private sector to mainstream youth development in public sector programmes and to promote youth enterprises and cooperatives.
Honourable Members,
We believe that the interventions we have mentioned briefly will take us forward in placing job creation high on the agenda of all decision makers in the country.
Seven Ministers met with our social partners on Tuesday to discuss this partnership and we remain optimistic that we are poised for success.
Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson,
Government, with its social partners, is reviewing legislation on labour brokers and the policy framework for the provision of public employment services.
This will enable government to maintain a database of job seekers and job opportunities.
The Government Position Paper on Social Security Reform is expected to be released this year for discussion.
Issues to be dealt with include the funding and nature of the National Social Security Fund, how the private sector occupational and retirement funds will fit into the entire system, and the possible regulatory structure.
Government must fill all funded vacant posts. The performance monitoring and evaluation department will provide a report within six months.
Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson,
Indeed, we have come a long way since 1994. We have achieved a lot, but much more still needs to be done, and working together as South Africans, we will achieve much more!
Please allow me to now tackle the other four priorities as well as other programmes.
The focus in basic education this year is Triple T: Teachers, Textbooks and Time. We reiterate our call that teachers must be at school, in class, on time, teaching for at least seven hours a day.
The administration must ensure that every child has a textbook on time, and that we assist our teachers to create the right working environment for quality teaching to take place.
To track progress, this year, we began the annual national assessments in literacy and numeracy that are internationally benchmarked, for grades 3, 6 and 9.
We will continue investing in teacher training, especially in mathematics and science.
We will pay special attention to the training of principals, particularly those in underperforming schools.
The focus of higher education will be to expand access especially for children of the poor.
This includes the conversion of loans into bursaries for qualifying final year students.
Students in Further Education and Training Colleges who qualify for financial aid will be exempted from paying fees.
We urge state owned enterprises to play a key role in skills development and help us provide the technical skills needed by the economy.
Denel, Eskom, SAA and Transnet have supported the training of more than 6 000 learners in technical and engineering-related scarce and critical skills.
Fellow South Africans,
We are continuing to improve the capacity and effectiveness of the police in particular the detective services, forensic analysts and crime intelligence.
We have increased visible policing and patrols in identified hotspots. We are making visible progress in reducing the proliferation of illegal and legal firearms.
Our courts continue to function better, and the backlog reduction programmes at district and regional levels are proceeding well.
We will continue to prioritise crimes against women and children, and to provide support through the Thuthuzela Care Centres.
We will work with communities and other key stakeholders to deal with drug peddling and drug abuse which are tearing some communities apart.
My visit to a drug rehabilitation centre in Mitchells Plain on Tuesday convinced me that we need more energy in the fight against drug abuse and drug peddling in our communities.
I have directed our police force to deal decisively with people who sell drugs to children in Cape Town and other areas. We will also not tolerate tavern owners who sell alcohol to children.
A Special Anti-Corruption Unit has been established in the Department of Public Service and Administration to handle corruption-related disciplinary cases involving public servants.
About R44 million has been recovered from public servants who are illegally benefiting from housing subsidies, while the cleaning of the social grants system of fraud is also continuing.
We have directed the Special Investigating Unit to probe alleged maladministration or corruption in various government departments, municipalities and institutions.
While not pre-judging the investigations, they prove our resolve to combat corruption at all levels of Government and the public service.
The Multi-Agency Working Group on procurement led by National Treasury, SARS and the Financial Intelligence Centre is reviewing the entire state procurement system to ensure better value for money from state spending.
In the health sector, this year we will emphasise the appointment of appropriate and qualified personnel to the right positions.
We need qualified heads of department, chief financial officers, hospital chief executive officers, district health officers and clinic managers.
We plan to revitalise 105 nursing colleges countrywide, to train more nurses.
We are also planning to open a medical faculty at the Limpopo Academic Hospital to train more doctors.
The renovations and refurbishments of hospitals and clinics will continue.
Given our emphasis on women’s health, we will broaden the scope of reproductive health rights and provide services related to amongst others, contraception, sexually transmitted infections, teenage pregnancy and sanitary towels for the indigent.
On the fight against HIV and AIDS, we have revitalised our programmes and promote various prevention measures including medical male circumcision, prevention of mother to child transmission and the promotion of HIV testing.
The testing has been popularly taken up around the country. Just over 5 million HIV tests have been done since the launch of the testing campaign in April last year.
Over the past year, work has continued to develop the National Health Insurance policy and implementation plan. Government will soon be releasing the policy document for public engagement.
Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,
We will continue with the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme directed at reviving land reform projects and irrigation schemes in the former homelands as well as distressed farms owned by individuals.
Government has developed the National Rural Youth Service Corps programme to assist youth in rural areas. To date, more than 7 000 young people have been employed in the programme.
Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson,
We will continue with the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme directed at reviving land reform projects and irrigation schemes in the former homelands as well as distressed farms owned by individuals.
Building a responsive, accountable, effective and efficient local government system
Honourable Members,
The frustrations in some areas resulted in protests which indicated the problems that existed in this sphere.
We have to make people’s experience of local government a pleasant one, as it touches their homes and their lives directly, every day.
Some municipalities are functioning very well, and some councillors are also performing their duties as well as they should.
We have instituted a turnaround strategy for local government, focusing on, amongst others, the strengthening of basic administrative systems, financial management and customer care.
The preparations for local government elections are on course.
The registration that took place last weekend went well, and we congratulate those who have registered. We urge those without identity documents to apply without delay, so as not to miss the next registration period next month.
Following the launch of the National Population Registration Campaign in Libode, in the Eastern Cape last year, more than 700 000 first time identity documents were issued, indicating great enthusiasm by our people to have this crucial document.
As we prepare for elections, we also note that our country has been struck by devastating floods in recent weeks, and many families have been affected.
We extend heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. Our hearts also go out to those who were injured and who lost all their belongings.
Fellow South Africans,
Let me use this opportunity to announce that Government has set aside R800 million for immediate relief to assist communities.
We will also be earmarking funding to deal with post disaster recovery and reconstruction in the years ahead.
We thank relief agencies, non-governmental organisations, private sector, religious organisations and communities for assisting those in need.
Building a better Africa and a better world
The African agenda remains our key policy focus.
South Africa is serving a two year term on the African Union Peace and Security Council.
The country will chair the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security from August.
In this role, we will continue to engage the parties in the implementation of the Global Political Agreement in Zimbabwe and the development of a roadmap to elections.
We will also promote the resolution of the Malagasy conflict. We will monitor and assist where possible to ensure that the political and security situation in the DRC is conducive to elections.
We are also honoured to participate in finding solutions to the situation in Cote d’Ivoire, as a member of the African Union High Level Panel chosen to help resolve the challenges in that country.
We applaud the work of the South African National Defence Force, which has on average deployed over 2 000 military personnel in peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and the Central African Republic.
We will continue to participate in the revitalisation of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development with specific focus on the implementation of its infrastructure programme, of which we champion the North-South infrastructure development corridor.
South Africa has taken note of the unfolding developments in Egypt as well as the earlier events in Tunisia.
We continue to monitor the situation closely, including its implications for the Middle East and North Africa.
We firmly believe that the course and the content of the transition as well as the destiny that these sister countries choose, should be authored by them.
In this regard, South Africa lends its support to efforts aimed at introducing and implementing political reforms that will ensure a smooth and peaceful transition in Tunisia and Egypt.
We trust that nothing will derail the realization of the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a secure independent state, existing side by side and in peace with the Israeli state.
South Africa reiterates its call to the international community to encourage the parties to continue the search for a durable solution in the Middle East.
We extend our heartiest congratulations to the people of the Sudan for a successful referendum, and welcome the new state of Southern Sudan.
This is a key African success story. We congratulate the African Union and the United Nations for the skilful handling of this project.
On the broader international front, we look forward to hosting the fifth India-Brazil-South Africa Summit, this year.
At the G20 Forum, we will continue to argue for a more equitable world economic order.
Building a national democratic and cohesive society
Fellow South Africans,
The experience of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup taught us the need to appreciate all that is good about our country.
The South African flag became the most important item for every household.
Government will build on this by ensuring the placing of flags in schools and public institutions to promote our national symbols and identity.
We urge all our people to learn the national anthem and sing it properly, with pride.
We will launch a programme celebrating National Icons and promote a National Heritage Route, to honour individuals who have made an enormous contribution to the liberation of our country.
Honourable Members,
We have seen the power of sport as a unifying and nation building tool in our country.
All of us must support the Proteas who will soon be playing in the 2011 ICC World Cup, and the Springboks who will travel to New Zealand to defend our 2007 Rugby World Cup Title.
We also wish the national netball team well when they compete in the Netball World Cup in July. We will be fully behind them.
Let me take this opportunity to salute one of our finest cricketers, Makhaya Ntini who is our special guest this evening. He has made an enormous contribution to local and international cricket.
South Africa will have its third post-apartheid census in October this year. We thank Mr Makhaya Ntini for agreeing to become an ambassador of this important campaign.
Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson,
Our performance monitoring and evaluation department will coordinate and monitor the work of government departments closely, as they mainstream job creation.
We welcome the undertaking by Parliament to also monitor the adherence to the call to prioritise job creation by government.
Fellow South Africans,
Our goal is clear. We want to have a country where millions more South Africans have decent employment opportunities, which has a modern infrastructure and a vibrant economy and where the quality of life is high.
We all have a responsibility to work hard to make this a reality.
Everyone must think of how they can contribute to the jobs campaign through creating opportunities for themselves and others.
In doing so, we should draw inspiration from our beloved President Mandela in his inauguration address in 1994, reminding us of the need to work together.
He said:
“We understand it still, that there is no easy road to freedom. 
We know it well, that none of us acting alone can achieve success. 
We must therefore act together as a united people, for national reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a new world. 
Let there be justice for all. 
Let there be peace for all. 
Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all. 
Let each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfill themselves”. 
He said:

Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP;
Honourable Speaker of the National Assembly,

Special and distinguished guests,
Fellow South Africans,
Dumelang, good evening, goeie naand, molweni, thobela, abuxeni!
I would like to extend warm greetings to all on this important day.
It is an honour to speak to South Africans in this House and in their homes and viewing centres around the country.
I also extend a warm welcome to Ambassadors and High Commissioners representing 146 countries, with which South Africa has diplomatic relations. We value your presence in our country.
Compatriots and friends,
This State of the Nation Address takes place during a significant year in the history of our country, the centenary of the ruling party, the African National Congress.
In marking this occasion we are recognising the work of all South Africans in bringing about a truly free, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous country.
We wish to single out the former presidents of the ANC who led our struggle for liberation and of creating a better life across generations. We salute John Langalibalele Dube, Sefako Makgatho, Zac Mahabane, Josiah Gumede, Pixley ka Isaka Seme, AB Xuma, JS Moroka, Chief Albert Luthuli, Oliver Tambo, Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki.
We welcome the families of the former ANC Presidents who are our special guests this evening.
We also recognise other components of the liberation movement - the Black Consciousness Movement which was led by Mr Steve Biko, whose son Samora is also our special guest, and the Pan-Africanist Congress which was led by Mr Robert Sobukwe.
We acknowledge too, the contribution of the late former MP, Ms Helen Suzman, who was a lone voice in this very House, speaking out against oppressive laws.
Honourable Members,
Compatriots and friends,
The year 2012 is also special because it marks the 15th anniversary of the Constitution of the Republic, which gives full expression to our democratic ideals.
The Constitution is South Africa’s fundamental vision statement, which guides our policies and actions. We reaffirm our commitment to advance the ideals of our country’s Constitution at all times.
Compatriots and friends,
At the January Cabinet lekgotla, we decided to undertake a mid-term review, looking at progress from 2009 till now instead of the usual annual review.
The mid-term review indicated steady progress in various areas such as health, education, the fight against crime, human settlements, energy, water provision, rural development and others.
However, the triple challenge of unemployment, poverty and inequality persists, despite the progress made. Africans, women and the youth continue to suffer most from this challenge.
Compatriots and friends,
The mid-term review indicated steady progress in various areas such as health, education, the fight against crime, human settlements, energy, water provision, rural development and others.
At the January Cabinet lekgotla, we decided to undertake a mid-term review, looking at progress from 2009 till now instead of the usual annual review.
Compatriots,
When freedom was attained in 1994, South Africa inherited a problem of structural unemployment which goes back to the 1970s. Employment continued to deteriorate in the 1990s and the early 2000s due to slow growth and declining employment in gold mining and agriculture.
Although jobs grew rapidly during the boom of 2003 to 2008, unemployment did not fall below 20%.
Employment received another setback in the recession of 2009.
Fortunately, Government entered the 2008-2009 recession with healthy public finances, and a comparatively low level of debt.
This allowed for a flexible response to deteriorating economic conditions.
For example, we increased spending on social security and on infrastructure development to stimulate the economy, mainly through the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup build programme.
Informed by some of these difficulties and the need to move away from piecemeal planning, we took a decision in 2009 to establish the National Planning Commission and asked them to produce a national development plan for the country, informed by the Constitution of the Republic.
The Commission released the first draft of the National Development Plan for consideration, which looks at where we want to be in 20 years’ time.
The Plan also directly addresses the elimination of poverty and inequality as critical points that must be attended to.
The solution for the country therefore, is higher growth and job creation to reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty and inequality.
As a developmental state that is located at the centre of a mixed economy, we see our role as being to lead and guide the economy and to intervene in the interest of the poor, given the history of our country.
Informed by this responsibility, in 2010 we launched the New Growth Path framework and identified our job drivers as infrastructure development, tourism, agriculture, mining, manufacturing and the green economy.
We declared 2011 the year of job creation, and mobilised our social partners, namely business, labour and the community sector, to work with us in implementing the New Growth Path.
The results are encouraging, although we are not out of the woods yet, given the global economic situation.
The fourth quarter figures released on Tuesday, indicate that the rate of unemployment has come down from twenty-five percent to 23.9% as a result of new jobs.
During 2011, a total of 365 000 people were employed. This is the country’s best performance since the recession of 2008.
What is also important is that all the new jobs are in the formal sector of the economy, in sectors such as mining, transport, community services and trade to name a few.
There are two main things that we did right in 2011 which are contributing to this joint success.
Firstly, we mainstreamed job creation in every government entity including state owned enterprises.
Secondly, we strengthened social dialogue and cooperation between government, business and the community sector.
The Accords, signed by government, business and labour on procurement, skills development, basic education, and the green economy, confirm our common purpose and determination to build this country.
Government alone cannot solve the challenges faced by the country, but working together, solutions are possible.
Compatriots,
Let me take this opportunity to report back on the undertakings made in the SONA last year.
The Job Fund which we announced last year began operating in June. Over 2 500 applications were received in the first round. Project allocations of over one billion rand have been committed.
We had also announced 20 billion rand worth of incentives under Section 12(i) of the Income Tax Act, designed to support new industrial projects and manufacturing, and seven projects with an investment value of 8,4 billion rand were approved.
The procurement regulations empowering the Department of Trade and Industry to designate specific industries where local content is prescribed came into effect in December.
The sectors include clothing textiles, canned vegetables, leather and footwear.
Progress has also been made in amalgamating small business institutions, and a new entity will be launched this year.
We had announced 10 billion rand to be set aside by the IDC for job creation.
To date, about one point five billion rand was approved for 60 companies to promote job creation.
Compatriots and friends,
The mining industry, one of the job drivers in the New Growth Path, plays a critical role in the socio-economic development of the country.
As part of addressing the triple challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment, government has developed a beneficiation strategy, which seeks to provide opportunities in the downstream part of the minerals sector.
We remain committed to the creation of a favourable and globally competitive mining sector, and to promote the industry to attract investment and achieve both industrial growth and much-needed transformation.
Honourable Speaker,
Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,
The work done last year indicates that if we continue to grow reasonably well, we will begin to write a new story about South Africa—the story of how, working together, we drove back unemployment and reduced economic inequality and poverty.
It is beginning to look possible.
We must not lose this momentum.
For the year 2012 and beyond, we invite the nation to join government in a massive infrastructure development drive.
Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,
We remain committed to the creation of a favourable and globally competitive mining sector, and to promote the industry to attract investment and achieve both industrial growth and much-needed transformation.
Compatriots,
We will use the project management expertise gained during the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup to make this project a success.
The infrastructure plan will be driven and overseen by the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission, (PICC), which was established in September, bringing together Ministers, Premiers and Metro Mayors under the leadership of the President and the Deputy President.
The PICC has identified and developed projects and infrastructure initiatives from state-owned enterprises as well as national, provincial and local government departments.
These have been clustered, sequenced and prioritised into a pipeline of strategic integrated projects.
We have chosen five major geographically-focussed programmes, as well as projects focusing on health and basic education infrastructure, information and communication technologies and regional integration.
The projects are as follows;
Firstly, we plan to develop and integrate rail, road and water infrastructure, centred around two main areas in Limpopo: the Waterberg in the Western part of the province and Steelpoort in the eastern part.
These efforts are intended to unlock the enormous mineral belt of coal, platinum, palladium, chrome and other minerals, in order to facilitate increased mining as well as stepped-up beneficiation of minerals.
Using the developments in Limpopo as a base, we will expand rail transport in Mpumalanga, connecting coalfields to power stations.
This will enable us to decisively shift from road to rail in the transportation of coal, which has caused a deterioration of the roads in Mpumalanga.
The eastern parts of the North West province will also benefit from the greater focus on infrastructure connected to mining and mineral beneficiation.
Secondly, we will improve the movement of goods and economic integration through a Durban-Free State-Gauteng logistics and industrial corridor.
This project is intended to connect the major economic centres of Gauteng and Durban/Pinetown, and at the same time, connect these centres with improved export capacity through our sea-ports.
In this regard, I am pleased to announce the Market Demand Strategy of Transnet, which entails an investment, over the next seven years, of three hundred billion rand in capital projects.
Of this amount, 200 billion rand is allocated to rail projects and the majority of the balance, to projects in the ports.
Amongst the list of planned projects, is the expansion of the Iron Ore Export channel from 60 million tons per annum to 82 million tons per annum.
It also includes various improvements to the Durban-Gauteng Rail corridor and the phased development of a new 16 million tons per annum manganese export channel through the Port of Ngqura in Nelson Mandela Bay.
The Market Demand Strategy will result in the creation of more jobs in the South African economy, as well as increased localization and Black Economic Empowerment. It will also position South Africa as a regional trans-shipment hub for Sub-Saharan Africa and deliver on NEPAD’s regional integration agenda.
We have also been looking at the necessity of reducing port charges, as part of reducing the costs of doing business. The issue of high port charges was one of those raised sharply by the automotive sector in Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage during my performance monitoring visit to the sector last year.
In this regard, I am pleased to announce that the Port Regulator and Transnet have agreed to an arrangement which will result in exporters of manufactured goods, receiving a significant decrease in port charges, during the coming year, equal to about 1 billion rand in total.
Thirdly, we will develop a major new South Eastern node that will improve the industrial and agricultural development and export capacity of the Eastern Cape region, and expand the province’s economic and logistics linkages with the Northern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.
In the former Transkei part of the Eastern Cape, we are committed to building a dam using the Umzimvubu River as the source, in order to expand agricultural production.
In addition, the implementation of the Mthatha revitalization project, which is a Presidential special project, is proceeding very well.
Work is at an advanced stage to improve water, sanitation, electricity, roads, human settlements, airport development and institutional and governance issues.
Fourthly, in the North West, we will expand the roll-out of water, roads, rail and electricity infrastructure. Ten priority roads will be upgraded.
Fifthly, we see enormous potential along the west coast of the country and need to improve infrastructure to unlock this potential.
Our plans include the expansion of the iron-ore rail line between Sishen in Northern Cape and Saldanha Bay in the Western Cape, which will create large numbers of jobs in both provinces.
The iron-ore capacity on the transport-side will increase capacity from 74 million tons to 100 million tons per annum.
This will allow for the expansion of iron-ore mining over the next decade to feed the developing world’s growing investment in infrastructure and industrial activities.
Compatriots,
We have also identified critical social infrastructure projects. These include projects aimed at laying the basis for the National Health Insurance system such as the refurbishment of hospitals and nurses’ homes.
A total of 300 million rand has been allocated for the preparatory work towards building new universities in Mpumalanga and Northern Cape.
Another infrastructure project with great potential is South Africa’s bid to host the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope in partnership with eight other African countries. The winning bid will be announced next month. We urge you to support the country’s bid.
Lastly, our infrastructure work extends beyond our borders. South Africa champions the North-South Road and Rail Corridor, which is part of the African Union’s NEPAD Presidential Infrastructure Championing initiative.
Work in this regard, comprises various inter-related projects that cover roads and railways, border crossings, energy and information and communication technologies.
Compatriots,
The massive investment in infrastructure must leave more than just power stations, rail-lines, dams and roads. It must industrialise the country, generate skills and boost much needed job creation.
I will convene a Presidential infrastructure summit to discuss the implementation of the plan with potential investors and social partners.
Honourable Speaker, Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,
I would now like to discuss matters relating to the extension of basic services, addressing inequalities, peace and security and social cohesion.
I received a lot of valuable correspondence in the run-up to this SONA. Such interaction enables us keep in touch with our people and their needs.
I received an email relating to a housing problem from Mzukisi Mali, a public servant from the Fingo area in Grahamstown. He wrote;
“In 1994 my income was too high to get an RDP and too low to get a
“When I apply for an RDP I am told that I do not qualify and cannot get a bond because I am risky to the banks...’’
Fortunately we have gone some way to address the problem facing Mr Mali and many others.
In 2010, we announced a one billion rand guarantee fund to promote access to loans.
We are pleased to report that this fund will start its operations in April, managed by the National Housing Finance Corporation. The scheme will enable the Banks to lend to people who are in a similar situation as Mr Mali.
In addition, from April, people earning between three thousand five hundred rand and R 15 000, will be able to obtain a subsidy of up to R83 000 from Provinces, to enable them to obtain housing finance from an accredited Bank.
In addition, from April, people earning between three thousand five hundred rand and R 15 000, will be able to obtain a subsidy of up to R83 000 from Provinces, to enable them to obtain housing finance from an accredited Bank.
Compatriots,
There is an ongoing concern from business and communities about high electricity costs.
I have asked Eskom to seek options on how the price increase requirement may be reduced over the next few years, in support of economic growth and job creation and give me proposals for consideration.
We need an electricity price path which will ensure that Eskom and the industry remain financially viable and sustainable, but which remains affordable especially for the poor.
However to achieve sustainability, a pact will be required with all South Africans – including business, labour, municipalities, communities and all customers and suppliers.
We must save electricity.
For the next two years, until the Medupi and Kusile power stations come into operation, the electricity system will be very tight.
We should all play our part in order to avoid load shedding.
To increase energy capacity we will continue searching for renewable energy sources, especially solar electricity and biofuels as we implement the Green Economy Accord with economic stakeholders.
To date we have installed more than 220 000 solar geysers nationwide. The Government target is one million solar geysers by 2014-2015.
Honourable Members,
Honourable Members,
Government continues to extend access to basic water supply. However, clearly, water access is still a challenge in some areas.
An email from Mmatsheko Pine from Hammanskraal is a case in point.
The writer says; “There is the area called Ngobi near Hammanskraal, under Moretele Local Municipality, the people residing in the area are now old, aged and mostly sick.
“The area has been without water for the past two years. People rely on rain to harvest water.
There are water pipes and machines installed but the problem is said to be pressure to pump water. Could your office kindly assist with the powers that be?”.
I have asked the Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs to investigate this matter with a view to finding an urgent solution.
Water expansion has been delayed in some parts of the country due to a lack of infrastructure. This is being attended to. For example, five new water augmentation schemes are on schedule.
These are Olifants River Water Resource in Steelpoort in Limpopo Province, the Vaal River Eastern Sub-System in Secunda in Mpumalanga, Komati Water Augmentation Scheme in Nkangala in Mpumalanga, the raising of Hazelmere dam in KwaZulu-Natal and the Clan William Dam in Clan William in the Western Cape. In addition, nine out of 25 dams have been rehabilitated.
In relation to the announcements we made during the United Nations COP 17 climate change conference, an amount of 248 million rand is to be invested over next two years to deal with the issue of Acid Mine Drainage in Witwatersrand.
Let me take this opportunity to congratulate the inter-ministerial committee on COP 17 for making the conference a huge success
The final outcome of COP 17 was historic and precedent setting, ranking with the 1997 conference where the Kyoto Protocol was adopted.
Building on the success of COP 17, South Africa will participate in the Rio plus 20 Summit in Brazil, which marks the 10th anniversary of the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson,
Our intensive focus on education is paying off.
We are pleased that the matric percentage pass is on an upward trend. We congratulate the teachers, learners, parents and the communities for the efforts.
We will continue to invest in producing more teachers who can teach mathematics, science and African languages.
Compatriots,
Our call to teachers to be in school, in class, on time, teaching for at least seven hours a day remains pivotal to success. We thank the teacher unions for supporting this campaign.
A major achievement is the doubling of Grade R enrolment, from 300 000 in 2003 to 705 000 in 2011. We appear poised to meet our target of 100% coverage for Grade R by 2014.
To fight poverty and inequality and to keep learners in school, over 8 million learners attend no-fee schools while over eight million benefit from government’s school feeding scheme.
Last year, national government instituted a Section 100 (1)(b) intervention in the Eastern Cape, to assist the department of education to improve the delivery of education.
Problems included non-delivery of textbooks, non-payment of scholar transport, excess teachers and a general poor culture of learning and teaching.
We are pleased that the matric percentage pass is on an upward trend. We congratulate the teachers, learners, parents and the communities for the efforts.
Compatriots,
During the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup, we resolved that the South African legacy would be to promote universal access to education.
School attendance in the country is now close to 100 percent for the compulsory band, 7-15 years of age. But we remain concerned by the report of the General Household Survey in 2010 that just over 120 000 children in that band are out of school.
Grade 10 drop outs appear to be a problem, particularly in the rural and farm areas of the Western Cape.
The national Government will work closely with the Western Cape government, to trace these learners and provide support so that they do not lose their future.
With regards to higher education, we are exceeding targets. Close to 14 000 learners were placed in workplace learning opportunities over the past year, and over 11 000 artisans have completed their trade tests.

To expand access to tertiary education as per our announcement last year, 200 million rand was utilised to assist 25 000 students to pay off their debts to institutions of higher learning.
Compatriots and friends,
We congratulate the health sector as well as the South African National Aids Council led by the Deputy President of the Republic on the success of the HIV and AIDS programme.
While we are doing well with regards to treatment and the prevention of mother to child transmission, general prevention efforts must also be accelerated.
We also wish to encourage South Africans to live healthier lives to reduce the impact of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and hypertension.
Compatriots and friends,
The year 2013 will mark the centenary of the Natives Land Act of 1913, which took away 87 percent of the land from the African people.
The Constitution requires that the State must realise the restitution of land rights for those who were dispossessed by the 1913 law.
We have only distributed 8% of the 30% target of land redistribution for 2014 that we set ourselves. The process is slow and tedious and there is general agreement that the willing buyer-willing seller option has not been the best way to address this question.
That is why have introduced a new policy framework, the Green Paper on Land Reform.
We urge the public to participate in the process of improving land redistribution and reform to reverse the impact of the 1913 Act.
Honourable Speaker,
Compatriots,
On economic transformation, we are amending the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act. The amendments amongst other things, establish a statutory Commission that would deal with non-compliance and circumvention.
The proposed law will also criminalise fronting and other forms of empowerment misrepresentation.
With regards to issues of disability, we have directed all government departments to ensure that we meet the target we set several years ago of having 2% of people employed in the Public Service to be disabled persons.
We are also working towards a Women Empowerment and Gender Equality Bill, to promote compliance in both government and the private sector and to provide for sanctions in the case of non-compliance.
Meanwhile, the NEDLAC Process on the Atypical Forms of Employment and Labour Broking has now been completed.
Government seeks to eliminate all forms of abusive practices inherent in labour broking, in order to strengthen the protection of vulnerable workers. We trust that common ground will be found this year on this matter.
Compatriots,
In 2009 we made a commitment to accelerate the fight against crime and corruption.
The crime statistics for the period 2010/2011 indicate that our country witnessed a decline of 5% in the number of reported serious crimes compared to the previous year.
We will however, not become complacent. We are continuing to implement our programmes of making South Africans feel safe and to be safe.
We also continue to improve the performance of the state in various ways, including the fight against corruption.
The Multi-Agency Working Group on procurement led by the National Treasury, SARS and the Financial Intelligence Centre is reviewing the entire state procurement system to ensure better value for money from state spending.
Initiatives include the vetting of supply chain personnel in government departments.
To further improve security, the Department of Home Affairs, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the banking industry, to roll out the online fingerprint verification system in all participating banks, to assist in fraud prevention and detection.
Compatriots and friends,
We are working with various provinces to improve governance, systems and administration.
These include Gauteng to improve health service delivery, the Free State on transport and roads and Limpopo to improve governance and financial administration in five departments, including the provincial treasury.
We welcome the launch of Corruption Watch by COSATU, as well as the recent agreement between government and business to implement anti-corruption programmes.
These interventions will complement the work of government in combating corruption.
Compatriots and friends,
As part of promoting social cohesion, this year we will undertake and continue many heritage projects.
Museums and centres to be unveiled will include the 1980 Matola Raid museum in Maputo, the Ncome museum in KwaZulu-Natal, phase 2 of the Freedom Park museum and the Steve Biko heritage centre in Ginsberg in King Williamstown.
We have also prioritised the homes and graves of former ANC Presidents and other national heroes including Thomas Maphikela, Lillian Ngoyi, Walter and Albertina Sisulu, Griffiths and Victoria Mxenge, Robert Sobukwe and others.
Memorial sites to be prioritised include that of the Pondo Revolt, the sites of the Frontier Wars, the 1913 revolt by African women in the Free State, the 1957 anti-pass revolt by women in Zeerust, the Rocklands Civic Centre in Mitchells Plein where the United Democratic Front was formed and the Gugulethu Seven monument in Cape Town.
We are also in the process of purchasing and rehabilitating the Winnie Mandela house in Brandfort, the Dr. Moroka house in Thaba Nchu and the Bram Fischer house in Westdene.
Additional projects include the launch of the Dube Tradeport and the unveiling of the statue of John Dube at King Shaka International Airport next month and renaming the Kings House presidential residence in Durban after Dr Dube.
The Presidential Guest House in Pretoria will be named after Mr Sefako Makgatho and the Diplomatic Guest House in Pretoria after the late prolific diplomat, Mr Johnny Makatini.
Government will also table the National Traditional Affairs Bill which makes provision for the recognition of the Khoi-San communities, their leadership and structures.
It is important to remember that the Khoi-San people were the most brutalised by colonialists who tried to make them extinct, and undermined their language and identity. As a free and democratic South Africa today, we cannot ignore to correct the past.
I discussed this matter extensively with the Khoi-San community when I met with them in Cape Town last year and we agreed to work together to redress the injustices of the past.
Compatriots,
Next year 2013, the seat of government, the majestic Union Buildings, will mark 100 years of existence and planning will start this year to mark the centenary.
Fellow South Africans,
We must perform better in sports this year! Our star performer, Oscar Pistorius has set the standard for the year by winning the 2012 Laureus Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability Award. Congratulations for this achievement.
We also congratulate the national women’s soccer team Banyana Banyana for qualifying for the London Olympics for the first time. With our support, they will do well.
We have been given the honour to host the Africa Cup of Nations next year, replacing Libya as they are unable to do so.
Fellow South Africans,
Allow me to use this opportunity to extend heartiest congratulations and good wishes to Mama Rebecca Kotane, wife of former ANC treasurer general, Moses Kotane and SACP general secretary, who will turn 100 years old on Sunday the 12th of February.
The Young Men’s Guild of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa, Amadodana aseWesile, is also celebrating 100 years this year.
Another centenary celebration is that of Omama Besililo of the United Congregational Church of South Africa.
We wish them all successful celebrations.
Fellow South Africans,
We have outlined a busy infrastructure implementation programme for now until 2014 and beyond.
I would like to appeal to all our people to join hands as they always do, as we deal decisively with the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality. Nobody will do this for us, it is in our hands. And we are all equal to the task.
As we get back to work tomorrow, let us internalise the words of ANC Women’s League founding president Charlotte Maxeke who said in her Presidential address to the National Council of African Women.
“This work is not for yourselves — kill that spirit of self, and do not live above your people, but live with them. If you can rise, bring someone with you’’.

We greet all who are watching this broadcast from their homes and at GCIS viewing centres around the country, including those in Khayelitsha, Nyanga and Gugulethu here in Cape Town.
Let me also extend my gratitude to all who contributed to the preparation of this address. I received several messages via email, twitter and Facebook.
I also spent some time with Grade 12 learners who shared their own views on what should be contained in the speech. I found the inputs very informative and enriching.
Honourable Members,
Compatriots and friends,
On the 15th of August last year, the National Planning Commission handed over the National Development Plan, the vision of the country for the next 20 years, to the President in this august house.
The NDP contains proposals for tackling the problems of poverty, inequality and unemployment.
It is a roadmap to a South Africa where all will have water, electricity, sanitation, jobs, housing, public transport, adequate nutrition, education, social protection, quality healthcare, recreation and a clean environment.
The achievement of these goals has proven to be difficult in the recent past, due the global economic recession.
The crisis in the Eurozone affects our economy as the Eurozone is our major trading partner, accounting for around 21 per cent of our exports.
Our GDP growth is expected to average at 2.5% cent, down from 3.1% in the previous year. We need growth rates in excess of five per cent to create more jobs.
The National Development Plan outlines interventions that can put the economy on a better footing. The target for job creation is set at 11 million by 2030 and the economy needs to grow threefold to create the desired jobs.
In my last meeting with the business community, the sector indicated that for the economy to grow three-fold, we must remove certain obstacles.
We will engage business, labour and other social partners in pursuit of solutions. No single force acting individually can achieve the objectives we have set for ourselves.
Honourable Members,
I would now like to report on progress made since the last State of the Nation Address and also to discuss our programme of action for 2013.
I will look at the five priorities – education, health, the fight against crime, creating decent work as well as rural development and land reform.
Last year, I addressed the nation on government’s infrastructure plans.
By the end of March this year, starting from 2009, government will have spent about 860 billion rand on infrastructure. Various projects are being implemented around the country. I will discuss just a few.
The construction of the first phase of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Water Augmentation has commenced and it will provide part of the water required for the Matimba and the Medupi power stations.
The construction of the bulk water distribution system for the De Hoop Dam began in October 2012, to supply water to the Greater Sekhukhune, Waterberg and Capricorn district municipalities.
We have to shift the transportation of coal from road to rail in Mpumalanga, in order to protect the provincial roads. Thus the construction of the Majuba Rail coal line will begin soon.
We have also committed to improve the movement of goods and economic integration through a Durban-Free State-Gauteng logistics and industrial corridor.
In this regard, substantial work is now underway to develop the City Deep inland terminal in Gauteng.
Initial work has commenced in the expansion of the Pier 2 in the Durban Port.
And thirdly, land has been purchased for the development of a new dug-out port at the Old Durban airport.
In the Eastern Cape, I officially opened the port of Ngqura and construction is now underway to develop a major new transhipment hub.
The Umzimvubu Dam is critical for rural livelihoods. Preparatory work has commenced for the construction to begin next year.
The upgrading of Mthatha airport runway and terminal and the construction of the Nkosi Dalibhunga Mandela Legacy Road and Bridge are currently underway.
I have asked for work in the North West to be fast-tracked further in light of the huge backlogs in that province, especially electricity, schools, clinics, roads and water in the next two years.
To improve the transportation of iron-ore and open up the west coast of the country, we have expanded the rail capacity through the delivery of 11 locomotives.
The first phase of the expansion – to increase iron ore port capacity at Saldanha to 60 million tons per annum – was officially completed in September last year.
Construction work is taking place in five cities – Cape Town, Nelson Mandela Bay, Rustenburg, eThekwini, Tshwane to integrate the different modes of transport – bus, taxi and train.
In the energy sector, we have now laid 675 kilometres of electricity transmission lines to connect fast-growing economic centres and also to bring power to rural areas.
In addition, government signed contracts to the value of R47 billion in the renewable energy programme.
This involves 28 projects in wind, solar and small hydro technologies, to be developed in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Northern Cape and in the Free State.
We established an 800 million rand national green fund last year. To date, over 400 million rand investments in green economy projects has already been approved for municipalities, other organs of state, community organisations and the private sector across all provinces.
We have also rolled out 315 000 solar water geysers as of January this year, most of which were given to poor households, many of whom had never had running hot water before.
We have scored successes in extending basic services through the infrastructure programme. Close to 200 000 households have been connected to the national electricity grid in 2012.
You will also recall that Census 2011 outlined the successes in extending basic services. The report said the number of households with access to electricity is now at 12.1 million, which translates to 85%. Nine out of 10 households have access to water.
To prepare for the advanced economy we need to develop, we will expand the broadband network.
Last year, the private and public sector laid about 7000 kms of new fibre optic cables. The plan is to achieve 100% broadband internet penetration by 2020.
With regard to social infrastructure, a total of 98 new schools will have been built by the end of March, of which more than 40 are in the Eastern Cape that are replacing mud schools.
Construction is expected to begin in September at the sites of two new universities in the Northern Cape and Mpumalanga.
Last week, we published an Infrastructure Development Bill for public comment.
We are cracking down on corruption, tender fraud and price fixing in the infrastructure programme.
The state has collected a substantial dossier of information on improper conduct by large construction companies.
This is now the subject of formal processes of the competition commission and other law enforcement authorities.
The infrastructure development programme has been a valuable source of learning for government. In the year ahead, we will fast-track many of the projects that the PICC has announced.
The lessons are that we must coordinate, integrate and focus on implementation.
Honourable Members,
The past two years have demonstrated that where the state intervenes strongly and consistently, it can turn around key industries that face external or internal threats as has happened in our manufacturing sector.
We have seen the revitalization of train and bus production in South Africa, largely because of the drive for local procurement.
PRASA and Transnet have committed hundreds of billions of rands to improving our commuter and freight train network.
The clothing, textiles and footwear industry has stabilised after 15 years of steadily falling employment. A clothing support scheme provides broad financial support, saving a number of factories and jobs.
On broader economic transformation, revised Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Act and codes are being finalised. The development of black owned enterprises and black industrialists will be prioritised.
Government has several programmes of supporting small business. A key project for the Presidency currently is to get government departments to pay SMMEs within 30 days.
Departments are required to submit monthly reports so that we can monitor progress in this regard.
We have taken a decision that accounting officers who fail to execute this directive, should face consequences.
In the 2010 State of the Nation Address, I announced the Job fund, and three billion rand has been approved for projects that will create jobs.
Honourable Members,
Just over a third of the population is under the age of 15. Our country, like many others, has a crisis of youth unemployment.
Last May I asked constituencies at NEDLAC to discuss youth employment incentives. I am pleased that discussions have been concluded and that agreement has been reached on key principles. The parties will sign the Accord later this month.
The incentives will add to what Government is already doing to empower the youth.
State owned companies provide apprenticeships and learnerships and we urge that these be increased. We appeal to the private sector to absorb 11 000 FET graduates who are awaiting placements.
The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform runs the National Rural Youth Services Corps, which has enrolled 11 740 young people in various training programmes.
The Department is also planning nine Rural Youth Hubs per province, including in the 23 poorest districts in the country.
We will also use the Expanded Public Works Programme and the Community Work programme to absorb young people.
Working together we will find a solution to youth unemployment.
Honourable members,
We identified tourism as one of our job drivers.
Tourist arrivals grew at an impressive 10.7 percent between January and September 2012, which is higher than the global average of 4% for last year.
Ironically, the very success of South Africa’s national conservation effort resulting in over 73% of the worlds’ rhino population being conserved here, has resulted in our country being targeted by international poaching syndicates.
We are working with recipient and transit countries such as Vietnam, Thailand and China and are intensifying our efforts to combat this increasing scourge.
Honourable Chairperson,
Honourable Chairperson,
Mining, which is historically the backbone of the economy, has faced difficulties in recent months.
Last year the sector was hit by wild cat strikes and the tragedy in Marikana where more than 44 people were killed.
We established an Inter-Ministerial Committee made up of senior cabinet Ministers to assist families during that difficult period. The Judicial Commission of Inquiry led by Judge Ian Farlam continues its work.
Through working together we were able to restore social stability in the area.
Government, labour in the form of COSATU, NACTU and FEDUSA, Business Unity SA, Black Business Council and the community sector met in October and reached an agreement which laid the basis for a return to work across the mining industry.
In particular, we agreed to work together to strengthen collective bargaining; to address the housing problems in the mining towns; to support the National infrastructure Programme; to address youth unemployment; and to identify measures to reduce inequalities.
Work is underway and the team will report in due course with specific plans for Rustenburg, Lephalale, Emalahleni, West Rand, Welkom, Klerksdorp, Burgersfort/Steelport, Carletonville and Madibeng.
Two weeks ago, I had a meeting in Pretoria with Sir John Parker, the chairman of Anglo-American Plc to discuss the reported plans to restructure and retrench 14 000 workers at Anglo American Platinum.
Honourable Members,
Honourable Members,
We believe that at a policy level we have managed to bring about certainty in the mining sector. The nationalisation debate was laid to rest in December at the ruling party’s national conference.
Ensuring that the public services we provide our people today can continue to be provided to our people tomorrow, requires that we have suitable tax policies to generate sufficient revenue to pay for these services.
From time to time, we have commissioned studies into our tax policies, to evaluate the extent to which they meet the requirements of the fiscus.
Later this year, the Minister of Finance will be commissioning a study of our current tax policies, to make sure that we have an appropriate revenue base to support public spending.
Honourable Members,
Distinguished guests,
In last year’s address we raised the issue of the gap market, the people who earn too much to qualify for an RDP house and too little for a bank mortgage bond.
From April 2012 to December 2012, Provincial Departments committed a budget of 126 million rand of the Human Settlements Development Grant for this programme, known as the Finance Linked Individual Subsidy programme.
The money is being used through the National Housing Finance Corporation, which has been appointed to deliver houses to people within the Gap market in twelve registered projects.
A total of 70 million rand of this amount has been used to date.
Projects include Walmer Link in the Eastern Cape, Lady Selbourne, Nelmapius, Bohlabela Borwa, Cosmo City and Fleurhof in Gauteng, Intabazwe Corridor Housing in the Free State and Seraleng in North West.
The implementation of these eight GAP housing projects is currently underway.
Compatriots and friends,
Honourable Members,
On education, we are pleased that the Grade 12 pass rate is finally on an upward trend. We congratulate the Class of 2012, their teachers, parents and communities for the continued improvement.
We congratulate the top province for 2012, Gauteng and top grade 12 learner, Miss Madikgetho Komane, from Sekhukhune district, Limpopo, who is our special guest.
Honourable Members,
The Annual National Assessments in our schools, have become a powerful tool of assessing the health of our education system.
We welcome the improvement each year in the ANA results, but more must be done to improve maths, science and technology.
The Department of Basic Education will establish a national task team to strengthen the implementation of the Mathematics, Science and Technology Strategy.
We urge the private sector to partner government through establishing, adopting or sponsoring maths and science academies or Saturday schools.
Honourable members,
We are pleased with the growth of our early childhood education programmes, including Grade R.
We are also pleased with our adult education programme, Khari Gude, which has reached more than 2,2 million people between 2008 and 2011.
We also continue to encourage people from all walks never to stop learning. Many were inspired when accomplished musician and my special guest, Mr Sipho Hotstix Mabuse obtained his matric last year, at the age of 60.
Honourable Members,
We declared education as an apex priority in 2009. We want to see everyone in the country realising that education is an essential service for our nation.
By saying education is an essential service we are not taking away the Constitutional rights of teachers as workers such as the right to strike.
It means we want the education sector and society as a whole to take education more seriously than is happening currently.
All successful societies have one thing in common – they invested in education. Decent salaries and conditions of service will play an important role in attracting, motivating and retaining skilled teachers.
In this regard, we will establish a Presidential Remuneration Commission which will investigate the appropriateness of the remuneration and conditions of service provided by the State to all its employees.
I have directed that the first priority should be teachers.
The Commission will also assess the return on investment.
In elevating education to its rightful place, we want to see an improvement in the quality of learning and teaching and the management of schools. We want to see an improvement in attitudes, posture and outcomes.
Working with educators, parents, the community and various stakeholders, we will be able to turn our schools into centres of excellence.
Honourable Members,
Five years ago, South Africa had such a low life expectancy that experts suggested that by 2015, our life expectancy would have been exactly where it was in 1955.
It was with good reason that we were delighted when late last year, studies from the Medical Research Council, the Lancet medical journal and others began reporting a dramatic increase in life expectancy from an average baseline of 56 years in 2009 to 60 years in 2011. These reports also noted significant decreases in infant and under five mortality.
Increased life expectancy is a key to the country’s development. People are returning to work, they are being productive, economically and socially. The family structure is increasingly stable and parents live longer and are able to take care of their children.
We should not become complacent, in light of these achievements.
Given the high co-infection rate between HIV and TB, we have integrated these services.
Work is also continuing on the research side. South Africa has discovered a candidate drug to treat Malaria.
In addition, researchers at the Centre for the Aids Programme of Research in South Africa consortium, also discovered broad neutralising antibodies against HIV.
Deputy President Motlanthe has appointed new members of the South African National Aids Council Trust. We congratulate the team, which is led by retired Judge Zac Yacoob, as chairperson.
Diseases of lifestyle are on an alarming increase. We have to combat and lower the levels of smoking, harmful effects of alcohol, poor diets and obesity.
Honourable members,
In 2014 we will create the National Health Insurance Fund. The Department of Health will accelerate and intensify progress in the pilot districts.
In that regard, as from April this year, the first group of approximately 600 private medical practitioners will be contracted to provide medical services at 533 clinics within villages and townships in 10 of the pilot districts.
Compatriots and friends,
In June we will mark the centenary of the 1913 Land Act which turned black people into wanderers, labourers and pariahs in their own land.
Former ANC President Sefako Makgatho outlined as such in his 1919 ANC conference presidential address.
He said;
“The Native Land Act still operates as mercilessly in different parts of the Union, and as a result many native families are still working for white farmers only for their food’’.
We are also honoured, in this year of the anniversary of the 1913 Land Act, to have present among us, Mrs Nomhlangano Beauty Mkhize, one of the veterans who together with her husband, Saul Mkhize, led the struggle against forced removals in Driefontein and Daggaskraal, in the present Mpumalanga Province.
The land question is a highly emotive matter.
We need to resolve it amicably within the framework of the Constitution and the law.
I received a message on Facebook from Thulani Zondi who raised his concern about the slow pace of land redistribution. He said: “Mr President, as we are commemorating 100 years since the Land act of 1913 was introduced to dispossess the African majority.
I urge you to accelerate redistribution of the land to the landless African people.
“When we do the redistribution we need to be mindful of food security. Training and mentorship of emerging black commercial farmers must take place”.
From 1994, we have been addressing the land reform problem through restitution, redistribution and tenure reform.
As stated before, we will not be able to meet our redistribution targets.
Government’s mid-term review last year revealed a number of shortcomings in our land reform implementation programme. We will use those lessons to improve implementation.
Firstly, we must shorten the time it takes to finalise a claim. In this regard, Government will now pursue the ‘just and equitable’ principle for compensation, as set out in the Constitution instead of the “willing buyer, willing seller” principle, which forces the state to pay more for land than the actual value.
Secondly there are proposed amendments to the Restitution of Land Rights Act, 1994 in order to provide for the re-opening of the lodgement of restitution claims, by people who missed the deadline of 31 December 1998.
Also to be explored, are exceptions to the June 1913 cut-off date to accommodate claims by the descendants of the Khoi and San as well as heritage sites and historical landmarks.
Another key lesson is to provide adequate post-settlement support to new landowners so that land continues to be productive.
We also need to provide better incentives for commercial farmers that are willing and capable of mentoring smallholder farmers.
Another challenge we have faced is the preference for money instead of land by some claimants, which also does not help us to change land ownership patterns.
As part of the Presidency stakeholder engagement programme ahead of the State of the Nation Address, Deputy President Motlanthe held a meeting with both farmers and farm workers in Paarl on Tuesday.
Stakeholders agreed that there should be peace and stability in the agriculture sector and that the living and working conditions of farm workers should be improved urgently.
We will continue the engagement with both farmers and farm workers.
Compatriots and friends,
We should also remain mindful of rapid urbanisation that is taking place. The Census Statistics reveal that 63% of the population are living in urban areas. This is likely to increase to over 70% by 2030.
Apartheid spatial patterns still persist in our towns and cities. Municipalities alone cannot deal with the challenges. We need a national approach.
While rural development remains a priority of government, it is crucial that we also develop a national integrated urban development framework to assist municipalities to effectively manage rapid urbanisation.
As part of implementing the National Development Plan, all three spheres of government need to manage the new wave of urbanisation in ways that also contribute to rural development.
Honourable Members,
Improving the status of women remains a critical priority for this government.
The Bill on Gender Equality and Women Empowerment has been approved by Cabinet for public comment. The Bill criminalizes practices that have adverse effects on women and girls.
It also legislates the 50/50 policy position with regard to the representation of women in decision making structures.
Honourable Members,
The brutal gang rape and murder of Anene Booysen and other women and girls in recent times has brought into sharp focus the need for unity in action to eradicate this scourge.
It comprises government, non-governmental Organizations, Community-Based Organizations, Faith-Based organizations, academia, research institutions, government, men’s groupings, and representation from women, children and persons with disabilities.
We urge this coordinating structure to make the campaign of fighting violence against women an everyday campaign.
We applaud all sectors for the campaigns that have taken place already, highlighting that such acts will not be tolerated.
I have directed law enforcement agencies to treat these cases with the utmost urgency and importance. The Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units, which were re-established in 2010, have increased personnel.
During the last financial year, the Units secured over 363 life sentences, with a conviction rate of 73% for crimes against women above 18 years old and 70% for crimes against children under 18 years of age.
I have directed law enforcement agencies to treat these cases with the utmost urgency and importance. The Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units, which were re-established in 2010, have increased personnel.
Government is adding other mechanisms to protect women, such as the Protection from Harassment Bill. While the Domestic Violence Act also provides protection, it only applies to persons who are in a domestic relationship.
The Protection from Harassment Bill also deals with harassment by persons who stalk their victims by means of electronic communications.
In addition, the Combating of Trafficking in Persons Bill was passed by the National Assembly last year and is now at the National Council of Provinces.
Once implemented, the law will assist women and children, who are often victims of this heinous crime.
Compatriots and friends,
There is increased visibility of the police which contributes to the reduction in the levels of serious crime.
The operations focusing on illegal firearms, stolen and robbed vehicles, liquor and drugs which are regarded as main generators of crime have assisted in crime reduction.
Compatriots and friends,
Government continues to wage a war against corruption.
The capacity of the Special Investigating Unit has grown from an initial 70 staff members to more than 600 at present.
I have since 2009, signed 34 proclamations directing the SIU to investigate allegations of corruption, fraud or maladministration in various government departments and state entities.
Criminal Investigations were initiated against 203 accused persons in 67 priority cases under investigation by the end September 2012.
In total, pre-trial proceedings have been initiated against 191 persons. A total of 66 persons under investigation are alleged to have received R5 million or more benefits through corruption. Freezing Orders were obtained against 46 persons.
In other successes, in the past financial year, 107 officials working within the criminal justice system were convicted.
The Asset Forfeiture Unit seized assets valued at more than R541 million. A total of R61 million of these assets have already been forfeited to the State. The assets are channelled back to fighting crime and corruption through the Criminal Asset Recovery Account.
Last year, additional funding of R150 million from the Criminal Assets Recovery Account was approved for the work of the Anti-Corruption Task Team which comprises the Hawks, the Special Investigating Unit and the National Prosecuting Authority.
These resources are aimed at strengthening the capacity of these law enforcement agencies in our resolve to fight corruption.
We urge the private sector to also take this fight against corruption seriously so that we tackle it from all angles.
To further boost the fight against corruption, we will fill all vacant posts at the upper echelons of the criminal justice system.
Compatriots and friends,
Honourable Members,
There are some lessons from Marikana and other incidents that we cannot allow to recur in our country.
Our Constitution is truly one of our greatest national achievements. Everything that we do as a government is guided by our Constitution and its vision of the society we are building.
We call on all citizens to celebrate, promote and defend our Constitution.
Our Bill of Rights guarantees that “everyone has the right, peacefully and unarmed, to assemble, to demonstrate, to picket and to present petitions”.
We therefore call on our people to exercise their rights to protest in a peaceful and orderly manner.
It is unacceptable when people’s rights are violated by perpetrators of violent actions, such as actions that lead to injury and death of persons, damage to property and the destruction of valuable public infrastructure.
We are duty bound to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution as the supreme law of the Republic. We will spare no effort in doing so.
For this reason, I have instructed the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster to put measures in place, with immediate effect, to ensure that any incidents of violent protest are acted upon, investigated and prosecuted.
Courts will be allocated to deal with such cases on a prioritised roll. The law must be enforced and it must be seen to be enforced - fairly, effectively and expeditiously.
The citizens of our country have a right to expect that their democratic state will exercise its authority in defence of the Constitution that so many struggled so long and hard for. We cannot disappoint this expectation.
The JCPS Cluster has therefore put measures in place at national, provincial and local level to deal with such incidents effectively.
Let me hasten to add that government departments at all levels must work closely with communities and ensure that all concerns are attended to before they escalate. That responsibility remains. We are a caring government.
Honourable Members,
This year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the birth of the Organization of African Unity which has been succeeded by the African Union.
We pay tribute to the OAU for its relentless struggle for the decolonization of our continent, including contributing to our own freedom.
We will continue to work for a stronger and more effective organization of our Union.
The NEPAD programme as well as the African Peer Review Mechanism have just celebrated their tenth year of existence.
As the convener of the NEPAD Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiative, South Africa continues to work with other champions to implement high impact infrastructure projects in the continent.
On peace and security, we stand by the people of Mali in their effort to claim and assert the territorial integrity of their country.
We urge the leadership in the Central African Republic, Guinea Bissau and Somalia to continue their march towards lasting peace for the sake of their people. We remain firmly opposed to unconstitutional change of government.
We are encouraged by the developments between Sudan and South Sudan. We commend our former President Thabo Mbeki and other members of the AU High Level Panel for the dedicated manner in which they have been working with the two sides.
We are in solidarity with the DRC as the country battles the menace to its security.
South Africa will continue supporting Africa's peace efforts including through mediation, troop contribution for peace keeping, and by providing material and financial assistance.
In this regard, we look forward to the conclusion of political dialogues in Zimbabwe and Madagascar.
Our vision of a better Africa in a better world will receive great impetus when we host the 5th BRICS Summit next month in Durban.
We are inspired by the exponential growth of bilateral relations, diplomatically and economically, between South Africa and other BRICS countries.
Strengthening North-South relations remains central to our foreign policy agenda.
We reaffirm our partnership with countries of the North, especially the USA, Europe and Japan.
The UN’s 70th anniversary provides an opportunity to take forward the transformation of the UN Security Council.
We shall continue to use the G20 to represent the aspirations of the people of Africa and push for the transformation of Bretton Woods institutions.
South Africa’s internationalism has a strong element of solidarity to it. We stand with the people of Palestine as they strive to turn a new leaf in their struggle for their right to self-determination; hence we supported their bid for statehood.
The expansion of Israeli settlements into Palestinian territories is a serious stumbling block to the resolution of the conflict.
The right of self determination for the people of Western Sahara has to be realised.
We remain firm in our call for the lifting of the economic embargo against Cuba.
Working together we can do more to create a better Africa and a better world.
Compatriots,
In the year 2012, we focused on preserving and promoting our country’s cultural heritage with particular emphasis on our liberation heritage.
We also hosted a historic National Summit on Social Cohesion, focusing on building a socially inclusive, caring and proud nation.
In the implementation of our programme we will work with our Social Cohesion Advocates; eminent South Africans drawn from a variety of sectors within our society.
We are proud to have in our midst this evening, two of our eminent social cohesion advocates, Judge Yvonne Mokgoro and Advocate George Bizos.
Compatriots,
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Raid on Liliesleaf Farm, the Escape from Marshall Square as well as the Start of the Rivonia Trial.
A series of events are being planned throughout the year to mark the three events, culminating in a national commemoration on the 11th of July.
Honourable Members
We have just concluded a highly successful Africa Cup of Nations tournament. We extend hearty congratulations to the African champions, the Federal Republic of Nigeria and also to all participating teams for their contribution to showcasing the standard of African football.
We thank all our people for being excellent hosts and fans.
I had the opportunity to personally thank CAF President Honourable Issa Hayatou for affording us the honour of hosting the AFCON.
Compatriots and friends,
As I said earlier, this programme of action will be implemented differently as the activities of departments must be aligned with the National Development Plan.
Compatriots,
Before concluding, let me take this opportunity to extend our heartfelt condolences to the family of struggle stalwart and prominent human rights lawyer, Comrade Phyllis Naidoo who passed on today.
Only recently, we lost Comrade Amina Cachalia.
We are truly saddened by the loss.
Honourable Members,
Honourable Members,
As South Africans, we should continue to have one primary goal - to make our country a truly great and prosperous nation.
Happy Valentine’s Day to you all!
Honourable Members,

2. Implementation of government programmes
2.1. Cabinet joins Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa in welcoming the full endorsement of the minimum wage agreement that was agreed to by labour, government and business under the auspices of the NEDLAC Committee of Principals.
This endorsement is an important milestone in the process of making the National Minimum Wage a reality which will reverse the phenomenon of the “working poor” and allow employees to provide for the daily needs of their families. It also extends our social net to the most vulnerable in our society and helps us build a more inclusive society.
2.2. Government is securing the credibility of qualifications and higher education system.

1. Cabinet decisions
1.1. Cabinet approved the ninth annual iteration of the Industrial Policy Action (IPAP) 2017/18 to 2019/20 which addresses the key challenges of economic and industrial growth and race based poverty, inequality and unemployment. This is a key component of President Jacob Zuma’s Nine Point Plan and is aligned to the policy perspective of Radical Economic Transformation.
IPAP has scored significant successes in a number of key areas: saving many firms and jobs, supporting sectors which are indispensable to South Africa’s’ prospects for longer term industrialisation and opening new areas of economic growth to build on our comparative advantage and create globally competitive industrial capabilities.
Drivers of IPAP 2017-2020 include: a redoubled commitment to Radical Economic Transformation; ongoing efforts to secure shared and inclusive growth; rapid acceleration of the Black Industrialist Programme, and a much stronger and ongoing focus on labour intensity across the value chains that link the primary sectors of the economy to the manufacturing and services sectors coupled with a stepped-up export effort.
1.2. Cabinet was briefed on the findings of the 2014/15 National Survey of Research and Experimental Development (R&D Survey).
South Africa’s Gross Expenditure of R&D (GERD) was R29, 345 billion in 2014/15. This is a nominal increase of 14.4% from R25, 661 billion in 2013/14. This is the fourth consecutive year that GERD has increased after the contraction in 2009/10 and 2010/11. GERD as a percentage of GDP, a key indicator of R&D intensity in the economy, increased to 0, 77% in 2014/15.
Adequate and appropriate investment in R&D is required to achieve the objectives of the National Development Plan.
1.3. Cabinet supports the first biennial report on The State of Climate Change Science and Technology in South Africa.
The Report, which will be made widely available, provides a critical assessment and comparative overview of climate change scientific research and related technological innovations. It makes eight recommendations to improve the state of climate change science and technology in South Africa and position the country as a continental and global player in climate change science and technology. This will be used to strengthen, mitigation and adaptation strategies against climate change.
1.4. Cabinet approved the publication of the Information Communications Technology (ICT) Small, Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises (SMME) Support Strategy for public comment. The Strategy aims to develop strategic interventions to accelerate the development and growth of small enterprises in the ICT sector, and to facilitate increase in the levels of uptake and usage of ICTs by the general small business sector.
1.5. Cabinet approved publication of the National E-Strategy for public comment.
The e-Strategy articulates the vision for the development of an inclusive information society and knowledge economy for the country that is based on the needs of the citizens, business and public sector. This provides a platform for South Africans to integrate technology in their lives in a manner that is beneficial to society as a whole.
The aim is to develop a people centric caring knowledge based society, transforming the South African society and the economy based on access and utilisation of modern information communication technologies.
1.6. Cabinet approved publication of the National e-Government Strategy and Roadmap for public comment.
This Strategy guides the digital transformation of the public service into an inclusive digital society, so as to better enable citizens to benefit from the opportunities offered by digital technologies to improve their quality of life.

1.7. Cabinet approved the National Road Safety Strategy 2016-2030. This addresses the challenges and gaps identified by the Department of Transport on the implementation of the previous strategies, including the 2006 National Road Safety Strategy.
This contributes to the attainment of the National Development Plan goal to “reduce injuries, accidents, and violence by 50% from 2010 levels”. It also responds to the need to create an efficient, competitive and responsive economic infrastructure network to ensure safe and secure road infrastructure.
Road crashes have a dire consequence on families and communities as they result in a loss of life and place an increased burden on the social security and welfare system.
1.8. Cabinet approved publication of the Draft National Tourism Sector Strategy for public comment. This is South Africa’s tourism growth and development framework.
The Strategy aims to increase direct contribution of tourism to the economy from R118 billion to R302 billion by 2026 through collaborative planning, and the implementation of agreed priority actions.
Implementation of the current National Tourism Sector Strategy has contributed to significant growth in terms of tourist volumes, contribution to Gross Domestic Product, and a significant positive trade balance and job creation. The next growth phase focusses on inclusive growth and transformation in the sector.
1.9. Cabinet approved the National Strategic Plan (NSP) for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Tuberculosis (TB) and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) 2017-2022.
South Africa’s response to the HIV and TB epidemics means that the average South African now lives nearly a decade longer than they did in 2004. The rate of HIV infections have declined as have deaths from TB.
This fourth NSP seeks to scale up successes while introducing new strategies to prevent new infections, identify infected people sooner and successfully treat and care for them. It outlines the strategic framework for a multi-sectoral partnership to accelerate progress in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV, TB and STIs. This is aligned to the National Development Plan which acknowledges the profound effect that HIV and TB have in slowing national development.
1.10. Cabinet was briefed on the Ministerial Committee Report on the draft Policy Framework for Disability in the Post-School Education and Training System, which made recommendations towards the development of a Strategic Disability Policy Framework.

1.11. Cabinet approved the submission of the Revised Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Certificates, Diplomas, Degrees and other Academic Qualifications in Higher Education in African States to Parliament for ratification.

This Revised Convention aims to provide an enabling environment across African States for the recognition of higher education qualifications such as certificates, diplomas, degrees and other academic qualifications herby allowing for the mobility of learners, academics and workers across the continent.
1.12. Cabinet approved the publication of the National Policy for an Integrated Career Development System for South Africa, for public comment.

This is aligned to the National Development Plan which recommends the promotion of economic growth and employment, matching of unemployed workers to jobs, increasing skills development and the numbers of university graduates.
1.13. Cabinet was briefed on progress made on the Review of the Criminal Justice System and on the modernisation of the Criminal Justice System through the Integrated Justice System Programme.
Cabinet approved the broad framework for the development of an Integrated Criminal Justice System which will address challenges and shortcomings across the criminal justice value chain.
The Integrated Criminal Justice System is geared towards strengthening the cooperation and integration of law enforcement agencies in realising the strategic objective of the National Development Plan – of building safer communities and creating a resilient anti-corruption Criminal Justice System. This contributes to the Outcome that All People in South Africa are and Feel Safe.
1.14. Cabinet approved for the release of a Discussion Document for public consultation purposes which will result in the development of “a whole of government and societal approach” National Anti-Corruption Strategy.
The Strategy is intended to address corruption, both in the public and private sectors as identified in the National Development Plan. The measures introduced aim to create a resilient anti-corruption system that promotes multi-sectoral collaboration across all sectors.
1.15. Cabinet approved the new White Paper on International Migration. This is a policy framework that will guide the comprehensive review of immigration and other related legislation.
The White Paper affirms South Africa’s sovereign right to determine the admission and residence conditions for foreign nationals in line with its national interest. It provides a progressive vision for South Africa to maximise the benefits of well-managed international migration while minimising the associated risks. International migration should be embraced while guarding sovereignty, peace and security.
1.16. Cabinet supports the Naturalisation Ceremony to be conducted by the Department of Home Affairs and approves that it be compulsory for persons who are granted citizenship by naturalisation to attend the ceremony. Cabinet also approved that magistrate courts, amongst others, be utilised for conducting Naturalisation ceremonies.
The Ceremony provides an opportunity to induct new citizens on their rights and responsibilities and to take an oath of allegiance in front of the Minister. This will contribute to social cohesion by highlighting the need for South Africans to welcome foreign nationals who have acquired South African citizenship.
1.17. Cabinet was briefed on the work done by the Presidential Creative Industries Task Team of Deputy Ministers. The Task Team chaired by the Deputy Minister in the Presidency provides a strategic platform for decision-makers in government, civil society and the private sector to discuss collective action that will accelerate transformation in the creative industry. Issues that are dealt with include: piracy, copyright protection and infringement, local content and airplay, social security including income smoothing, organisation the industry in particular performers, transformation of the sector and skills development.
1.18. Cabinet approved South Africa’s revised offer in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Trade in Services Negotiation relating to the construction and transport sectors.
This promotes domestic growth of priority sectors including by expanding the market access opportunities for South African service exports.
Service liberalisation represents a key step in the deeper integration of SADC and contributes to the establishment of a regional market that will support the emergence and development of regional firms to provide services to a larger regional market. This contributes to the National Development Plan’s objectives of promoting regional economic integration and the development of the African continent.
1.19. Cabinet approved the tabling of the accession to the Amended Nairobi Convention for the Protection, Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Western Indian Ocean, in Parliament.
This provides a mechanism for regional cooperation, coordination and collaborative actions in the Eastern and Southern African region. This will enable Contracting Parties to harness resources and expertise from a wide range of stakeholders and interest groups towards solving interlinked problems of the coastal and marine environment including critical national and transboundary issues.
Accession will combat pollution and ensure sound environmental management of coastal and marine resources which affects food security, health and potential for economic growth.

Cabinet was briefed on the outcomes of the 22nd Session of the Conference of Parties (COP22) to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the 12th Session of the Conference of Parties serving as the Meeting of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 12), which was held from 7 to 18 November 2016, Marrakech Morocco.
Marrakesh COP 22 was an important transitional moment from years of negotiations that produced the Paris Agreement to implementation of adaptation and mitigation actions. COP 22 objectives were largely achieved in line with the South African mandate.
1.21. Cabinet approved the South African negotiating mandate to serve as a basis for engagement at the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Convention (COPs), to be held from 24 April to 5 May 2017 in Geneva.
The aim is to work towards environmentally sound management of chemicals and waste in order to embrace sustainability of human health and the environment.
1.22. Cabinet approved the submission of the Initial Country Report on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
The attainment of socioeconomic rights forms a vital part of the Constitution and the National Development Plan. Since the advent of democracy South Africa has made important strides in progressively realising the socio-economic rights of her people. In the past 18 years we have built democratic institutions, transformed the public service, extended basic service, stabilised the economy and taken our rightful place in the family of nations. Despite these successes poverty, inequality and unemployment remain our key challenges.
2. Bills

Celebration of our national heroes ensures that our youth and future generations know and understand their contribution and what they stood for.
4.8. We have witnessed an alarming increase in the number of racist incidents, which detracts from the gains that we have made as a democracy.
We must cherish that we live in a country that enshrines human rights and dignity. These gains came at a great price. People lost their lives.

We must continue to build a South Africa that will enshrine the human rights of all, regardless of their class, gender or geographical location.

5. Issues in the Environment
5.1. Government has welcomed the Constitutional Court’s judgement on the payment of grants. The Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Comprehensive Social Security, chaired by President Jacob Zuma has been hard at work to ensure that Government continues to pay more than 17 million social grants to qualifying beneficiaries from 1 April 2017.
Beneficiaries receiving social grants from merchants and banks will be paid on 1 April 2017 while those using SASSA pay points will be paid from 3 April 2017. Social grant beneficiaries must take note of their respective pay days, which appears on the slips received on their previous pay date, in March 2017. The SASSA call centre, toll free: 0800 60 10 11 will be open to assist beneficiaries with all their enquiries. Arrangements have been made to ensure that the SOCPEN system is available for investigation and verification of the status of grant applications.
Government’s social assistance programme remains an important safety net for millions of South Africans. It is at the heart of government’s poverty alleviation programme, and has helped to restore the dignity of our people. We are a caring Government continually striving to improve the living conditions of poor, vulnerable and underprivileged South Africans.
5.2. Cabinet affirms that the rights and safety of all women in our society must be protected. The recent incidents of sexual assault on women, particularly by taxi drivers is a cause for concern.
Cabinet commends the brave women who have come forward to report these incidents and appeals to communities to assist to find the perpetrators of violence against women and children.
5.3. Cabinet reiterates the commitments made by President Jacob Zuma’s during his address at the 17th National Teachers' Awards: that Action will be taken against teachers who continue to use corporal punishment in schools, this is unlawful and action will be taken against teachers who break the law and violate the dignity and personal safety of children. The problem of teenage pregnancies and crime in some schools, such as gang violence, drugs, alcohol and bullying are also being prioritised.
5.4. Cabinet has noted with concern increasing incidents of taxi violence in some parts of the country. All role players in the taxi industry are urged to engage in dialogue and seek solutions to the underlying issues so that they don't negatively affect commuters who depend on their services. Cabinet calls on the transport sector and law enforcement agencies to work together to tackle the resurgence of taxi violence.

1. Cabinet decisions
1.1 Cabinet approved for the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to co-host the World Aquaculture Society conference in Cape Town from 26 to 30 June 2017.
This contributes to Operation Phakisa Aquaculture Lab which aims to increase aquaculture growth by five-fold in the next five years from 4 000 tons to 20 000 tons, to create 15 000 jobs and increase the contribution of aquaculture towards GDP.
Aquaculture presents a good opportunity to diversify fish production to satisfy local demand, food security, export opportunities and create jobs. Hosting the conference will promote the sector, enhance investment by private sector and donors, and assist in fast-tracking aquaculture development locally through insights from aquaculture strategies from other nations.
1.2 Cabinet approved the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Committee to oversee and provide strategic direction during the preparations for and hosting of the 37th Ordinary Southern African Development Community (SADC) Summit of Heads of State and Government to be held in August 2017.
The SADC Summit will take place under the theme “Partnering with the Private Sector in Developing Industry and Regional Value Chains”, emphasising the need to address critical factors to implement and achieve SADC’s Industrial Strategy and Action Plan.
South Africa will utilise its position as Chair of SADC to strategically advance the country’s national interests as outlined in the National Development Plan and strengthen regional economic opportunities and security-related matters.
1.3 The Department of Arts and Culture will host a third edition of Africa Month in May 2017. This forms part of South Africa’s contribution to the continents’ celebration on the transition from the Organisation of African Unity, which was established on 25 May 1963, to the current African Union, and its related institutions and programmes.
The celebration of Africa Month contributes to the decolonisation of the African continent through a variety of government and civil society projects under the theme: “A Year of OR Tambo: Building a Better Africa and a Better World”.
Africa Month contributes to the Pan African call for African unity and co-operation, and is used as a platform by all African Union Member States to take stock of progress made towards realising Agenda 2063.
The government-wide month long programme, which will be available on www.gov.za, goes beyond the arts and culture sector to embrace the contributions of the South African Government through economic, political and social factors impacting on the development of the continent. Activities and dialogues are celebratory and educational, all have political and socio-economic benefits for the people of South Africa and the rest of the continent to celebrate their Africaness and recommit to building communities grounded on positive shared African values and principles.
1.4 Cabinet was briefed on the successful hosting of the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) and Institutions Annual World Library and Information Congress held in South Africa, Cape Town from 15 to 21 August 2015.

2. Implementation of Government Programmes
2.1 Government’s commitment to bolster the economy was reaffirmed during the successful engagement between the Minister of Finance, Malusi Gigaba with investors and the global finance community during the visit to the United States of America for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Spring Meetings. Minister Gigaba also interacted with domestic investors and the NEDLAC Special Executive Committee chaired by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.
The engagements underscored that government’s policy orientation towards prudent fiscal discipline and stringent fiscal consolidation as highlighted in the 2017 National Budget will remain unchanged.
Cabinet calls on all sectors to partner with government to boost confidence and propel the economy towards sustained inclusive growth.
2.2 President Jacob Zuma’s launch of the Maluti-A-Phofung Special Economic Zone (MAP-SEZ) in Tshiame, Harrismith, in the Eastern Free State, on 25 April 2017 demonstrates governments’ promotion of industrial development which is key to the nation’s long-term economic success and prosperity. The priority sectors for the MAP-SEZ are automotive, agro-processing, logistics, ICT, pharmaceuticals and general processing. This creates opportunities for manufacturing as well as a regional and international trade environment with an added value chain within the Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality.
The launch of the SEZ brought the tally of Special Economic Zones in the country to eight. To date the SEZ Programme has collectively attracted over R9.5 billion worth of investments. They have also created over 10 000 direct jobs and 65 000 indirect jobs. The Special Economic Zones also continue to play a role in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
This 1038-hectare MAP-SEZ launch forms a key part of the implementation of the Industrial Policy Action Plan which designates Special Economic Zones to accelerate local economic growth and development in specific regions of the country.
2.3 Cabinet welcomes the A.T. Kearney’s 2017 Foreign Direct Investment Confidence report, which indicates that South Africa is the 25th most attractive destination for foreign direct investment globally, the first from the African Continent.
South Africa made a comeback into the index, which publishes the 25 most attractive investment destinations, for the first time since 2014. It ranks with other developing countries such as China (3rd), India (8th); Brazil (16th) and Mexico (17).
This ranking shows that South Africa’s strategic partnership with foreign investors is gaining momentum and further demonstrates that our country’s blueprint on development is yielding results. Improvements in short-term economic prospects and the long-term investment in the country’s manufacturing sector have been cited as some of the key drivers of South Africa’s improved rating on the Index.
2.4 In a separate report, the latest Africa Investment Index 2016 by Quantum Global’s independent research arm ranks South Africa fourth most attractive investment destination in Africa after Botswana, Morocco and Egypt. South Africa scored well on the growth factor of GDP, ease of doing business in the country and significant population.
The country’s attractiveness as an investment destination of choice was further highlighted in the African Economic Outlook 2016 report, which places South Africa fourth among the leading African investment destinations in 2015 after Egypt ($10.2 billion), Mozambique ($4.7 billion) and Morocco ($4.2 billion) with $3.6 billion in foreign investment. South Africa continues to build on its strong financial and business base, ranking 47th out of 138 countries in the World Economic Forum Global Competitive Index 2016/17.
2.5 The 27th World Economic Forum on Africa will take place at the Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban from 3 to 5 May 2017 under the theme: “Achieving Inclusive Growth: Responsive and Responsible Leadership.”
Cabinet welcomes this opportunity for South Africans to engage in dialogue on potential investment opportunities, deeper regional integration and a renewed commitment towards sustainable growth and development in Africa.
Africa is home to some of the world’s fastest growing economies which have attracted increasing interest from global investors. South Africa is the most diversified economy on the continent and plays an integral role in Africa’s advancement.
2.6 The commitment by South Africa and Oman to enhance trade relations, at a business forum on 27 March 2017 between Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies and his Omani counterpart, Dr Ali Bin Masoud Al-Sunaidy, enables South African businesspeople to take advantage of the opportunities that Oman presents, particularly for agricultural and agro-processing industries.
Further, the Department of Trade and Industry’s investment mission to Ghana and Nigeria between the 20 and 25 March 2017 contributed to identifying and creating export markets for South African value-added products and services. It also promotes South African products, service offerings and creates business partnerships between business communities of the respective countries.
Increasing trade on the continent and fostering partnerships with African partners can lead to poverty alleviation, increased trade flows, industrial development and subsequent creation of more jobs, which is key to the economic development of Africa.
2.7 The Minister of Small Business Development, Lindiwe Zulu led the South African delegation at the Estonia business forum which was hosted by the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry. With Estonia’s economy consisting of 90 per cent SMMEs, South Africa’s partnership bolsters government’s commitment to job creation and the promotion of small, medium-sized and micro enterprises (SMMEs).
2.8 The resilience of our farming sector supported by early warning systems and research, notwithstanding the Fall Army Worm infestation and the drought, was demonstrated by the 2017 estimated commercial maize crop size, which is 84% bigger than the 2016 crop, which was the smallest crop since 2007. The three main maize producing areas, namely the Free State, Mpumalanga and North West provinces are expected to produce 82% of the 2017 crop.
2.9 Governments’ commitment to strengthening, developing, and broadening access to universities, is demonstrated in the doubling of student numbers over the past 20 years. This was bolstered by the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Dr Blade Nzimande’s announcement of government spending to the tune of R 7-billion over the next two years on new student housing, laboratories, communications technology, and other essential facilities, as well as essential maintenance and the further expansion of the new universities. A further R 2, 5-billion over the next five years will target historically disadvantaged universities so as to better enable them to realise their full academic potential.
Investment in infrastructure, including teaching and research spaces, equipment, and conducive student living environments is key to ensuring that the universities can deliver on their empowerment mandate
2.10 The Minister of Labour, Mildred Oliphant will lead the national 2017 Workers Month awareness campaign under the theme “Know your rights and responsibilities as a means to promote greater compliance”.
2.11 Government embarked on the 6th National Imbizo Focus Week of the current administration from 17 to 23 April 2017. The week was marked by a heightened period of engagements between members of the executive and citizens and contributes to government’s broader plan of improving the lives of all citizens.
Cabinet commends those communities who participated in the izimbizo with government officials across the country, with a view to addressing public service challenges and providing a better life for all.
Other izimbo included: the launch of the Centre for Entrepreneurship at Goldfields TVET College in Welkom, Free State by the Minister of Small Business Development, Ms Lindiwe Zulu. The Centre contributes to addressing the challenge of youth unemployment by providing appropriate support to young people at the early stage of the entrepreneurial journey. 34 engagements were held across the country.
3. Issues in the Environment
3.1 President Jacob Zuma led the 23rd national Freedom Day celebrations on 27 April 2017 under the theme “The year of OR Tambo: Together deepening democracy and building safer and crime-free communities”.
The President’s engagement in Manguzi, Umhlabuyalingana forms part of a national anti-crime campaign, which is also a follow-up to the Presidential Siyahlola Monitoring Programme in March 2017. It highlights the need for urgent action to address cross-border crime especially car hijackings. Government is hard at work in the area to eradicate crime and to address issues from the Umhlabuyalingana community, including challenges around the Isimangaliso Wetland Park.
The celebrations reflect on the country’s achievements since 1994 while mindful of the work that still needs to be done in building a truly united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa. In Freedom month we celebrate the contribution to our freedom and democracy, of former ANC President and national hero, Oliver Reginald Tambo, who would have turned 100 years old this year had he lived.
3.2 As part of the Freedom Month programme the Minister of Communications, Ayanda Dlodlo, initiated a youth dialogue as part of on-going discussions with youth on what it means to them to “OWN YOUR FREEDOM”, the tag used to follow the discussion on social media.
Cabinet calls on youth to exercise their rights and responsibilities prudently and to respect those who fought for our freedom, that it being enjoyed by all in our democratic country.
3.3 Cabinet welcomes the first meeting of the South Africa-China high level People-to-People Exchange Mechanism (PPEM) which took place from 24 to 27 April. This was the realisation of an agreement from the 2015 State Visit to South Africa between President Jacob Zuma and President Xi Jinping. The IMC on the People-to-People Exchange Mechanism, led by Minister Nathi Mthethwa hosted Vice Premier Lui Yandong and delegates from the People’s Republic of China.
A range of cooperation agreements were signed falling within the two broad themes –Human Capital Development, and Research and Development. The growth of an inclusive economy characterised by radical socio-economic transformation goes hand in hand with building the capacities of our people, especially our youth at various levels.
Cabinet welcomes the donation of medical equipment (made in SA) from the Chinese government, as part of a cooperation agreement in health between Africa and China, this will contribute to improving the quality of services delivered in public hospitals.
Through the co-operation agreements both nations are committed to forge close mutual technical co-operation, teacher training and expertise exchanges in the field of education, particularly in Mathematics, Science and Technology as building blocks for the growth of knowledge economies. Other areas for enhanced cooperation include: culture; communications; health; science and technology; sports; tourism; women affairs and youth.
3.4 Cabinet conveys its condolences to the families and friends of the 235 people who lost their lives due to road accidents over the Easter holiday. The statistics for the period indicate that 50 per cent of the people who died were pedestrians, followed by passengers at 24 per cent and drivers at 19 per cent.
Cabinet thanks all government departments, NGOs, professionals and businesses who are supporting the affected families as well as learners and staff members from Mahlenga High School and Refano Primary School during this difficult period.
The road carnage, particularly during holidays in South Africa, remains a pressing national concern. In many cases these fatalities could have been prevented through responsible behaviour and use of the country’s roads. Reckless and negligent driving are unacceptable and all South Africans are urged to take personal responsibility for their safety on our roads.
3.6 Cabinet commends the bus transport sector for returning to work after a violence free strike, showing the way for industrial protests. The Minister of Labour’s role must be acknowledged in facilitating the end of the strike for this very important sector of our economy.
3.7 Cabinet is concerned by the recent upswing in violence in Vuwani following the decision by the Municipal Demarcation Board to incorporate it into a new municipality. Cabinet strongly condemns the use of our children as a negotiation tool, the weeks of school shutdown dampens the future of these children who are placed under additional stress. Violence, intimidation, vandalism, or actions that lead to schools being destroyed or learners deprived from going to school has no place in our democracy.
Cabinet acknowledges the work done by the Inter Ministerial Committee, led by the Minister of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs Mr Des Van Rooyen and the visit by Safety and Security Minister, Fikile Mbalula, and endorses the view that criminal activities including damage and destruction of property will not be tolerated. President Jacob Zuma is scheduled to meet with VhaVenda King Toni Mphephu Ramabulana and traditional leaders from Vhembe district in a bid to bring stability. Cabinet emphasises that money and resources spent on replacing damaged schools was meant for other programmes.
3.8 Cabinet also called for calm and stability following violent protests in Lichtenburg town and Blydeville Township, in Ditsobotla Local Municipality, North West. Schooling was disrupted, shops were looted and cars as well as several houses were burnt. North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo, has appointed a team comprising five MECs and two mayors to investigate and address service delivery challenges in the area.
3.9 Cabinet appeals to the Coligny community, in North West to stop their violent protests and allow the South African Police Service in Coligny to complete their investigation into the death of a child, to ensure that justice is served.
Citizens are urged to raise their concerns through existing structures and within the bounds of the law.
3.10 Government commends law enforcement agencies for their response in bringing perpetrators of violence against women and children to book.
In this regard, Cabinet welcomes the swift actions taken by the Hawks’ Human Trafficking Unit and the South African Police Service’s Tactical Response Team who arrested a Durban-based pastor on a charge of human trafficking in Port Elizabeth.
It is the duty and responsibility of all South Africans to work with authorities to protect our women and children from predators and to ensure that we do our part in making our communities safer.

1. Issues in the environment
1.1 Cabinet is concerned with the rising incidences of abuse and violence against women in our society. Recent incidents involving intimate partner violence have seen many brave and courageous women speaking out against this violation of their rights.
1.2 Cabinet acknowledges that as a country we continue to have a patriarchal society and as such calls for more to be done to fight the scourge of femicide and human trafficking.
1.3 Cabinet calls on all sectors of society to join hands in defeating this scourge, oppose any form of violence committed against women and children, and work with the police and justice system in order to bring perpetrators to justice.
1.4 President Jacob Zuma has called for a stop to the continued abuse of women and children. Cabinet has instructed the Social Protection, Community and Human Development Cluster to put in place a programme of action that will drive the country in the fight to stop the abuse of women and children.
1.5 Cabinet welcomes the results of the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey by Statistics South Africa, which measures the health status of South Africans, and the reach and quality of health programmes. The survey amongst others reports a 20% drop in infant mortality and a 11% drop in the number of women and men who smoke tobacco.
The results demonstrate that the policy interventions that were put in place by President Zuma’s administration are yielding positive results.
Cabinet, however, is concerned about the number of South Africans that still continues to engage in unprotected sex with multiple partners. Some 32% and 42% of women and men respectively indicated that they have never been tested for HIV despite government efforts to raise awareness on HIV testing.
Cabinet calls on all South Africans to take personal responsibility for their health and well-being, practice safe sex and get tested regularly for HIV and all communicable and non-communicable diseases.
1.6 Cabinet calls on parents and guardians to ensure their children are vaccinated against childhood diseases. Cabinet remains committed to ensuring children are immunised to eliminate life threatening infectious diseases. Cabinet reassures parents and guardians that the drugs administered by the Department Health are safe.
1.7 Cabinet welcomed the first phase of the revitalised Vulindlela Heights Industrial in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. This is part of the country’s Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme. It is the second of its kind in the Eastern Cape and one of six parks being revitalised across the country.
Government is revitalising industrial parks to boost job creation and ensure inclusive growth. The move of economic activities away from urban centres is also part of government’s economic transformation efforts.
Information on how to take advantage of opportunities available at our industrial parks, access government support and incentives programmes, and investment opportunities in various sectors is available at www.thedti.gov.za or through the Department of Trade and Industry’s (the dti) Customer Contact Centre on 0861 843 384.
1.8 Cabinet has noted with regret the decision by General Motors South Africa (GMSA) (Pty) Ltd to phase out the manufacturing and sale of Chevrolet vehicles in the country.
Government remains committed to support the country’s automotive sector, which is critical for the economy and job creation.
The dti continues to work with all stakeholders to mitigate the impact. To increase manufacturing, employment creation and export intensity, we recently launched the ninth phase of the Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP) to guide our actions. Cabinet notes that Isuzu, which has been partnering with GMSA over the years in South Africa, will take over the operations from GMSA.
1.9 Cabinet has noted the deterioration of the drought situation in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. Cabinet calls on the communities to support the water restrictions introduced by the provinces. A team comprising officials from the Department of Water and Sanitation, the National Disaster Management Committee working with the provinces and local government, had been actively engaged in ensuring that short to medium-term solutions are fast-tracked to guarantee the water security of the province in the long term.
Cabinet calls on all South Africans including domestic users, businesses, mining sector, energy and agriculture to work together and use water more sparingly
1.10 Cabinet welcomed the released Anti-Corruption Strategy discussion document, which will inform the National Anti-Corruption Strategy. Cabinet invites the public to make written inputs through the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation website: www.dpme.gov.za.
The fight against corruption remains one of the main priorities for government. Corruption and integrity failures in both the private and public sector have a detrimental effect on our country’s development.
1.11 Cabinet expressed concern at the recent global cyber-attack, which has been reported as the biggest cyber-attack to date.
Cabinet urges all South Africans to take the necessary precautions when using electronic means of communicating or transacting. The use of updated antivirus software which scans the environment frequently is also recommended.
The President has, however, set up an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) comprising the Ministers of Public Enterprises, Energy, Finance and Justice and Correctional Services. The IMC is asked to gather the facts in order to guide Cabinet on how to deal with such matters in future. The convenor is the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Mr Michael Masutha.
2. Cabinet decisions
2.1 Cabinet approved the publication of the Reviewed Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Charter for the South African Mining and Minerals industry in 2017.
Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane will provide a briefing once the charter has been gazetted.
2.2 Cabinet endorsed the approved National Radio Frequency Plan 2017 by the Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services. The allocation of spectrum by the World Radiocommunication Conference has a significant impact on the economic growth of South Africa.
The National Radio Frequency Plan 2017 is a comprehensive source of radio frequency spectrum allocation for different radio communication services. The revised National Radio Frequency Plan 2017 ensures South Africa is aligned with the approved International Radio Regulations that were adopted in the 2015 International Telecommunication Union conference.
2.3 Cabinet approved the Inland Waterways Safety Strategy. The strategy, through the South African Maritime Safety Authority, sets standards and enhances procedures for permitting and licensing arrangements for boats operating on inland waterways. This will ensure the safety of small vessels on South Africa’s inland waterways.
2.4 Cabinet approved the Road Freight Strategy. The strategy aims to create an integrated regulatory and operational framework, which will enable South Africa to achieve best international standards of road-freight operations.
The recommendations in this strategy will enhance the efficiency of enforcement, promote road safety, improve the protection of the infrastructure, reduce environmental impacts, and create an integrated framework of quality-regulated competition within which the road freight sector can continue to serve the needs of the South African economy.
2.5 Cabinet approved the South African Mint Company’s designs for the 2017 and 2018 numismatic commemorative and circulation coins.
In collaboration with Cabinet, a new series was developed that represents culture, freedom and democracy under the theme: “Celebrating South Africa”. The centenary of Struggle stalwart Oliver Reginald Tambo’s birth was chosen as the first subject to be depicted.
The introduction of the new R50 (1oz, sterling-silver) coin, R500 (1oz, 24-carat gold) coin and R50 (base metal alloy) coin celebrating the 100-year anniversary of OR Tambo’s birthdate.
2.5.1. Designs for the following 2017 and 2018 commemorative coin series have been developed:
2017 coin series: Oliver Reginald Tambo Centenary Celebration,
2017 circulation coin: R5 coin depicting the Order of the Companies of OR Tambo,
2017 Protea coin series: Life of a Legend – Nelson Mandela,
2017 R1 coin series: Reptiles of South Africa – the Puff Adder,
2018 UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Man and the Biosphere coin series: The Waterberg Biosphere Reserve,
2018 coin series: National Geographic Society ‘Big Cats Initiative’ – The Lion,
2018 coin: 2018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM.
3. Upcoming events
3.1 Cabinet calls on all South Africans to support the Child Protection Week from 28 May to 4 June under the theme: “Let us all protect children to move South Africa forward”. The protection of our children is the duty and responsibility of all South Africans; parents, guardians, individuals and communities.
As a society we have a duty to do more to ensure the most vulnerable in our society do not suffer abuse. It is in our hands to stop the cycle of neglect, abuse, violence and exploitation of children.
Cabinet encourages all sectors of society to work together to create safer and healthier communities so that our children can thrive.
3.2 In the centenary celebration of OR Tambo, South Africa will mark Youth Month in June 2017 under the theme: “The Year of OR Tambo: Advancing Youth Economic Participation.”
Over the month government will host a number of engagements including youth expos, dialogues and youth entrepreneur hubs to showcase opportunities available to young people, and inspire them to instil the educational and leadership values of OR Tambo.
Cabinet encourages all young people to access the various support and educational programmes that government has made available to improve their prospects and advance their participation in the economy.
3.3 Cabinet calls on employers to contribute to the coming Take a Girl Child to Work on 25 May and 26 May. The purpose is to expose girls from Grade 10 to 12 learners to different career options.
3.4 President Zuma will on Thursday, 25 May 2017, host the national 2017 Africa Day celebration at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria. This is a culmination of activities and programmes marking Africa Month under the theme: “The Year of OR Tambo: Building a Better Africa and a Better World”. The annual commemoration of Africa Day marks the founding of the Organisation of African Unity in 1963.
As we end Africa Month, Cabinet calls on all South Africans to partner with our fellow Africans residing in South Africa and elsewhere on the continent to ensure the prosperity for our region and the rest of Africa.
It is also incumbent on all who reside within our borders, South Africans and foreign nationals alike to adhere to the laws of the country. Together we must fight the scourge of human trafficking, abductions, and the abuse of women and children.
4. Congratulatory messages
4.1 Cabinet congratulates the Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Academic Hospital medical team comprising of Prof Andre van der Merwe, Dr Alexander Zuhlke, Prof Rafique Moosa, Dr Amir Zarrabi and Dr Zamira Keyser. They recently performed a second penis transplant, making it the first medical centre in the world to successfully perform this procedure twice. The success of this procedure in the hands of our transplant team is testimony to the high level of skill and expertise that exists in the public health sector in South Africa.
5. Condolences

Acting Director-General (GCIS)

1. Issues in the environment
1.1 Cabinet reiterates President Jacob Zuma’s call for South Africans to unite against violence and abuse of women and children, and calls on all South Africans to take urgent steps to eradicate this scourge in our communities. This follows the President’s visit to Elsies River in Cape Town in support of the Fight against Crime Imbizo. This visit once again highlighted the vulnerability of women and children in our society.
The President undertook to return to the area to look into the many challenges of crime and murder, especially of children and how law-enforcement authorities would improve their services to the community.
1.2 Cabinet welcomes the release of the General Household Survey (GHS) 2016, which continues to show progress in the implementation of government programmes to improve the lives of South Africans, especially the previously disadvantaged communities.
The statistics show that government is making inroads in providing housing, with South African households living in ‘RDP’ or state-subsidised dwellings increasing from 5% in 2002 to 13,5% in 2016. The survey also shows that government’s social-assistance programmes indicate an increase from 12,7% in 2003 to 29, and 7% in 2016.
There is also a marked increase in access to water, electricity and sanitation, which is an important marker for the South African Government’s ambition to redress the wrongs of apartheid and provide basic services to all the people.
Cabinet has, however, noted that while higher education enrolments are on the increase, albeit at a slow pace, only 3,3% of black Africans aged 18 to 29 years were studying as opposed to 18,8% of Indian/Asian individuals and 17,5% of the white population in this age group. Only 3,5% of the coloured population was studying during 2016.
The survey further indicated a decrease from 23, 8% to 11, and 8% of households that experienced hunger, which shows progress in addressing communities living in extreme poverty.
1.3 Cabinet noted the Quarterly Labour Force Survey for the first quarter of the year that showed the economy adding 144 000 jobs. These numbers were offset by an increase in the number of job-seekers by 433 00 people. Cabinet reaffirms its commitment to continue partnering with the private sector and labour in its attempts to address the country’s unemployment challenges.
1.4 Cabinet welcomes the launch of the refurbished Babelegi Industrial Park in Hammanskraal as part of government’s plans to accelerate economic development and job creation in the area. The R42 million project is part of government’s Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme and one of six parks that are being revitalised across the country for broader economic and industrial development.
Cabinet encourages local industries and businesses to consider expanding operations to industrial parks to access the various support measures which are available to further develop their businesses.
The economy was nevertheless supported by growth in the mining and quarrying industry which increased 12.8%. The agriculture, forestry and fishing industry rebounded in the first quarter of 2017 with an increase of 22.2%.
There are green shoots that the country can leverage to boost its own economic growth outlook. These include improving global growth, stabilising commodity prices, more favourable climate conditions, reliable electricity supply and less volatile labour relations.
As a matter of urgency, Cabinet calls on business, labour and the broader society to partner with government to intensify our growth programme and improve confidence so as to arrest the decline and set the economy on a higher trajectory, to achieve inclusive economic growth. In this regard the Minister of Finance will meet with business leaders in a bid to formulate strategies to counter economic recession and achieve inclusive growth.
Cabinet endorsed a full media briefing by the Minister of Finance to share with South Africans the interventions government will embark upon within the current budget framework. Cabinet further reaffirms the adopted budget framework for the country.
1.6 The rating agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor’s affirmed South Africa’s long-term foreign currency debt ratings of ‘BB+’.
This comes amid the Minister Gigaba’s engagements with the private sector to ensure that the joint work of government, business, labour and the civil society continues, and that the pledges made are fulfilled.
Cabinet reiterates that South Africans must continue to act in unison, especially during difficult times and work even harder to ensure that the country reclaims its investment grade status.
1.7 Cabinet welcomes deliberations at the inaugural Joint Administration Committee (JAC) for the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) and the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) recently held in the country.
The parties agreed to jointly consider opportunities to promote the MERCOSUR-SACU Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) by including their trade promotion agencies, chambers of commerce, private sector, and their respective embassies and foreign missions. The MERCOSUR-SACU agreement provides local exporters with the opportunity to tap into a market of more than 280-million people.
Cabinet calls on all the country’s exporters to take advantage of the PTA as local products are now able to enter the MERCOSUR bloc at preferential duty rates.
1.8 Cabinet expressed regret at the decision of the United States of America (USA) to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.
The Paris Agreement, which will be fully operational by 2020, is premised on contributions determined by countries themselves towards collectively agreed global goals.
South Africa has called on the USA to reconsider its position and recommit to the multilateral process.
1.9 The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Novartis, the South African Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Department of Science and Technology, paves the way to boost the volume and quality of clinical trials and build research capability on the continent.
The agreement will allow for joint research programmes in selected communicable and non-communicable diseases, improve South African patients' access to innovative medicines, and build the country and continent's research and development capabilities.
1.10 Cabinet welcomes the 2017 Report from the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) which continues to rank South Africa as the top business events destination in Africa and the Middle East. The report was released in May 2017 in Frankfurt.
South Africa remains one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations and continues to top the rankings also on the World Economic Forum Travel’s global travel and tourism competitiveness index as released in April 2017.
Cabinet would like to see more of South Africa’s smaller towns and cities bidding for smaller meetings where they can meet the hosting requirements. This will help to improve the geographic distribution of tourism beyond the major centres and spread the wealth generated by these events more equitably.
1.11 Cabinet calls on South Africans to be vigilant of fake news, in particular the increase in false posts on social media over missing, kidnapped and abducted girls and women. The recent outbreak of violence in KwaMashu over fake reports of children being abducted in the area and the alleged abduction of a girl in Naledi, Soweto by persons in a Toyota Quantum with registration number included went viral on social media, which was later found to be untrue.
These hoaxes, fake news and the dissemination of false information cause panic among our communities and waste time and resources of the police. We appeal to people not to repost and disseminate fake news on social media, until they have verified the authenticity.
1.12 Cabinet has noted with serious concern the media reports on the ‘leaked emails’ that are purported to implicate Ministers, officials and private individuals in alleged wrongdoing.
Cabinet remains fully committed to good governance and at the same time, it also notes that all persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty in terms of our Constitution.
Cabinet urges all who have information about any wrongdoing by government officials or Ministers to inform the law-enforcement agencies so that investigations can be undertaken.
It is aware that some cases have already been opened, and the police are undertaking the necessary investigations. All who are affected by the emails are urged to cooperate with the law-enforcement agencies.
President Zuma has rebutted the allegation that was published by a Sunday newspaper that he owns a house in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
2. Cabinet decisions
2.1 Cabinet was apprised of the 4th performance quarterly progress reports for 2016/17 (January-March 2017) on the implementation of priority outcomes.
Cabinet’s oversight over the implementation of the Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2014 to 2019, results in improved service delivery. This takes us closer to the realisation of the NDP’s Vision 2030.
Government has made considerable progress in implementing its 14 priority outcomes and advancing the objectives of the NDP. Challenges affecting implementation and action required to improve delivery were also identified.
The GCIS is coordinating cluster media briefings, which are scheduled to take place from 9 to18 June 2017. An updated schedule will be posted to www.gov.za.
3. Upcoming events
3.1 President Zuma launched Youth Month under the theme “The Year of OR Tambo: Advancing Youth Economic Empowerment”, with a meeting of the Presidential Youth Working Group. This brought together government and leaders of youth organisations, who took stock of progress in the socio-economic advancement of young people.
Ministers and Deputy Ministers will engage in various activities aimed at promoting youth development and empowerment. The National Youth Day commemoration event will take place in Ventersdorp, North West on 16 June 2017. This year marks the 41st anniversary of the Soweto Uprising and the commemoration serves as a reminder that young people in the country were at the forefront of our Struggle.
Cabinet encourages all young people to participate in Youth Day activities and to make use of all the support and resources that government has made available to improve their prospects and advance their participation in the economy.
3.2 Local Government Youth Conference
The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Mr Des van Rooyen, will convene the Local Government Conference from 19 to 22 June 2017, under the theme “Young people taking charge in development”. The conference will launch the Local Government Youth Development Forum.
This will enable young people to review the progress of local government against the achievement of the National Youth Policy 2020. It will also strengthen partnerships between government, business and civil society in developing young leaders in the local space.
3.3 Minister for Public Service and Administration, Ms Faith Muthambi will lead the South African delegation to attend the Africa Public Service Day (APSD) in Kigali, Rwanda on 21- 23 June 2017. The theme for this year is “Entrenching a Citizen-Centred Service Delivery Culture: Partnering with the Youth for Africa’s Transformation”. The theme offers opportunities to scrutinise on how the public service define and respond to a citizen-centered service delivery culture that is defined by the way things are currently done.
4. Condolences
4.1 Cabinet extends its condolences to the family and friends of the commuter who died when two Metrorail trains collided near the Elandsfontein station in Ekurhuleni and wishes a speedy recovery to those injured in the accident.
Cabinet calls for the investigation into the root cause of the accident to be fast-tracked to prevent a recurrence of such fatal accidents.
4.2 Cabinet joined the international community in strongly condemning the latest terrorist attack in the United Kingdom (UK). The attack, which took place on the night of 3 June 2017 in the city of London, claimed the lives of several people and left others injured.
The attack in London occurred within a fortnight of the one in Manchester, where many civilians, mainly youth and children, lost their lives.
Cabinet extended its condolences to the government and people of the UK, in particular the families and loved ones of the deceased, and wished the injured a speedy recovery.
4.3 Cabinet extend its condolences to the family and friends of Professor Babatunde Osotimehin who passed away this week. Professor Babatunde Osotimehin was the Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund. He was key in driving the issues of sexual and reproductive health in Africa in recent years.
He worked tirelessly to promote the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and young people in Africa and worldwide. He campaigned actively for Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex (LGBTI) rights.
4.4 Cape storms and Knysna fires
Cabinet noted the storms that have affected most parts of the Western Cape and the subsequent damage. Cabinet sends its condolences to the families of those who lost lives and property during these disasters, the latest figure reported is eight (8). The Cape Town Disaster Risk Management Center is encouraged to do its best in saving lives and property, including in the Knysna area where there are raging fires. We call upon the people to adhere to safety measures.
5. Congratulations

Ms Phumla Williams
Acting Director-General (GCIS)
Cell: 083 501 0139
Cabinet met on Wednesday, 21 June 2017 at Tuynhuys, Cape Town.
1.1. Cabinet reflected on the recent announcements by the three major ratings agencies. All three ratings agencies raised similar issues such as the slow pace of growth-enhancing reforms, the performance of state-owned companies (SOCs) and political risks, among other issues.
Cabinet reiterates that the foundation for a higher growth path and socio-economic development has already been laid.
It focuses on improving investor and consumer confidence by fast-tracking the implementation of the structural reforms for economic growth.
President Jacob Zuma convened the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Advisory Council workshop on Tuesday, 20 June 2017, which focused on radical socio-economic transformation.
The workshop, amongst others, addressed the systematic and structural implementation challenges of the Broad-Based BEE Act, 2003 (Act 53 of 2003) and the proposed recommendations to realise government’s objectives on radical socio-economic transformation.
The partnership between government, business, labour and civil society is critical to boost confidence levels, so that working together we can reclaim and maintain investment-grade ratings.
1.2. As Youth Month draws to a close, Cabinet thanks all sectors who participated in activities across the country. The participation of thousands of young people in the various Youth Month empowerment activities that were hosted by departments, government entities and the private sector is encouraging.
This year marks the 41st anniversary of the 1976 Soweto Student Uprising and the commemoration serves as a reminder that young people in the country were at the forefront of our Struggle.
Cabinet calls on youth to use all the support and resources that government has made available to improve their prospects and advance their participation in the economy.
1.3. Cabinet condemns the recent violence and intimidation of commuters during the protests by taxi owners. Such actions are out of place in a democratic society. Peaceful interventions on any matter will always be beneficial to all parties involved.
The subsequent agreement between the South African National Taxi Association and SA Taxi Finance Holdings is further confirmation that peaceful dialogue can resolve such issues without impacting on innocent people and disrupting the economy.
Cabinet welcomes this decision, which is in the best interest of commuters and the taxi industry.
1.4. Cabinet conveys its deepest sympathy to all who lost loved ones during the recent disasters in the Western and Eastern Cape respectively. A number of residents also suffered displacement and loss of property.
The President dispatched humanitarian and other support to all the affected areas. This was coordinated through the National Joint Operations Centre Disaster Management structure, working with the Western Cape Provincial Government and Provincial Disaster Management teams.
Cabinet thanks all non-governmental organisations, the private sector, volunteers and communities who are supporting affected communities.
1.5. Cabinet urges communities in Limpopo bordering Zimbabwe to be vigilant and exercise caution with their chicken stock. This follows a report of an outbreak of a bird and chicken flu virus called H5N8.
The trade in birds and chicken products from Zimbabwe has been suspended. The H5N8 virus is highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, and leads to a high level of mortality. Commercial farmers are also encouraged to increase their biosecurity measures on farms.
1.6. Cabinet has welcomed the High Court ruling that declared Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 (Act 51 of 1977) unconstitutional, lifting the 20-year limit to lay criminal charges against those accused of sexual abuse. This ruling will go a long way in strengthening our justice system’s capacity to act against those perpetrating violence against women and children.
1.7. Cabinet welcomes the recent Internet for All community session held in Kliptown, Soweto. The session – led by Telecommunications and Postal Services Minister Siyabonga Cwele, in partnership with the World Economic Forum, private sector and civil society – resulted in the training of about 500 young people in basic information and communications technology (ICT) skills. The Declaration on Internet for All adopted the leadership structure and also identified targets for implementation within the next six months.
Cabinet further welcomed the intervention by the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services through the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa and the Economic Development Department through the Competition Commission, to look into the high data costs that continue to be an inhibition to increase access to ICTs.
1.8. Cabinet is concerned by reports of services being disrupted at mortuaries in Gauteng due to ongoing labour disputes. As a result, grieving families are unable to claim their relatives’ bodies.
Death in any family brings an element of vulnerability and pain to the surviving family members. As society no amount of dispute is worth such insensitivity. Cabinet appeals to all parties involved to find an amicable solution to their disputes without affecting the families of the deceased.
2.1. Cabinet approved the White Paper on the National Health Insurance (NHI), to be gazetted as a policy document. The White Paper takes the country closer to ensuring all South Africans have access to healthcare, irrespective of their socio-economic status.
The NHI is a health financing system that allocates funds to provide access to healthcare.
This is consistent with the National Development Plan’s (NDP) objective that seeks to ensure everyone has access to healthcare, regardless of their income.
The Department of Health will hold a briefing on 29 June 2017 to fully unpack the elements of this White Paper.
2.2. Cabinet approved the Revised Human Resource Development Strategy towards 2030. The revised strategy addresses the weaknesses identified in the last five years in some parts of the education and training system and also identified the lack of coordination between different parts of the system.
The strategy is now aligned to the NDP and the Medium Term Strategic Framework 2014-2019.
It also focuses all the relevant stakeholders (government, labour, civil organisations and private sectors) on the needs of the economy and the importance of supporting an industrial strategy to achieve inclusive growth and development.
2.3. Cabinet approved the publication of the key findings of the 2015/16 survey on government funding for Scientific and Technological Activities. The 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology requires that the Department of Science and Technology monitor government funding of the science and technology sectors, and its contribution to South Africa’s growth and development.
The results of the findings of 30 national departments indicate that an estimated R23,4 billion was spent from the national fiscus in the 2015/16 financial year. Cabinet noted the nominal increase of 6.6% increase when compared with the previous year given the current fiscal constraints.
This total investment represents 1.7% of the total national budget for the year. Cabinet appreciated the fact that most of these funds were used in scientific services that support service delivery in core areas of government competency such as education, health, minerals, energy, agriculture and environment.
3. Bills
3.1. Cabinet approved the publication of the Customary Initiation Bill for public comment. The Bill seeks to protect, promote and regulate the customary initiation practices. Once approved, the Bill will provide acceptable norms and standards in conducting these customary practices. It will deal with the abuse of the initiation practice, which has seen a number of young boys dying in initiation schools.
Government and traditional leadership institutions have adopted a zero-tolerance stance towards the death of initiates as a result of initiation practices.
3.2. Cabinet approved the National Research Foundation (NRF) Amendment Bill of 2017 for submission to Parliament. The Bill has gone through its full public consultations. The amendments clarify the authority of the Minister of Science and Technology over the foundation and makes explicit the NRF’s responsibilities in respect of science engagement. These amendments will enhance the authority of the Minister to guide the NRF to improve efficiencies.
They will also improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of research, development and innovation provision to the quality of life of South Africans, through better alignment with government priorities.
3.3. Cabinet approved the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill of 2017 for submission to Parliament. The Bill strengthens aviation safety, security and environmental protection regulatory framework to ensure sustainability and stability of the civil-aviation industry.
The amendments include, amongst others, a provision for the operational independence of the aircraft accident and incident investigation; provision for the establishment of the Aviation Safety Investigation Board. It further amends and inserts certain definitions in the Act.
3.4. Cabinet approved the publication of the Sectional Titles Amendment Bill of 2017 for public comment.
The amendments update the working, functioning, application and administration of the Sectional Titles Act, 1986 (Act 95 of 1986). The current Sectional Titles Act of 1986 bestows certain rights on owners of sections in sectional titles scheme. The proposed amendment Bill proposes regulations of these rights in a meaningful manner.

5. Condolence message
5.1. Cabinet joins President Zuma in extending condolences:
To the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Dr Blade Nzimande, and his family on the passing of his mother, Mrs Nozipho Nzimande. The much-loved Mama Nzimande turned 90 years old last month.

on the passing on of Lord Joel Joffe. Lord Joffe, who died at the age of 85, was a defence attorney in the Rivonia and Little Rivonia trials. He bravely defended anti-apartheid activists, making an immense contribution to the project of democracy in South Africa.
to the people of Namibia on the passing on of Mr Toivo ya Toivo, a revolutionary in the struggle for freedom in Namibia and an anti-apartheid activist. Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo will officially represent the government of South Africa at the funeral that will take place on Saturday, 24 June 2017.

Cabinet met at the Sefako M Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria on Tuesday, 1 August 2017.
1. Cabinet Decisions
1.1. South Africa commemorates Women’s Month in August, as a tribute to more than 20 000 women who marched to the Union Buildings on 9 August 1956 in protest against the extension of pass laws to women.
The National Women’s Day celebrations will take place at Galeshewe Stadium, Kimberley in the Northern Cape. Cabinet approved the theme for this year’s celebrations as “Year of OR Tambo: Women united in moving South Africa forward.” Cabinet calls on South Africans to use the month of August to celebrate the role of women in our society.
Cabinet approved the three-year operational programme of the MRM and a phased approach of mainstreaming the moral regeneration programme within government.
Cabinet was apprised on the spin-offs from such an event. South Africa already has the requisite infrastructure to host the tournament without allocating a budget for infrastructure development. Sports is said to be one of the most effective drivers of nation-building and the rugby sports programmes would enhance social cohesion. The programmes to be rolled out throughout the country leading to 2023 will leave a lasting legacy for the development of rugby in underprivileged communities.

The tournament will contribute to stimulating our economy by supporting government priorities, especially as it relates to preferential procurement and adherence to the Sport Transformation Charter and the sharing of the profits derived. The event will further boost our tourism and hospitality sector.

The event will further boost our tourism and hospitality sector.
Cabinet approved the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on WRC 2023. The IMC will direct the bidding process for the RWC 2023 and ensure the country benefits economically from this event. The Minister of Sport and Recreation, Mr Thulas Nxesi, will hold a separate media briefing to unpack the bidding process.
This responds to the National Development Plan’s call for greater emphasis on innovation, improved productivity, more intense pursuit of a knowledge economy, and better exploitation of comparative and competitive advantages.
The IP Policy is an important policy instrument in promoting innovation, technology transfer, research and development, creative expression, consumer protection, industrial development and more broadly, economic growth.
1.5. Cabinet approved the Draft Green Transport Strategy to be published for public comments. This strategy will form the cornerstone of policy development within the transport sector regarding the lowering of the GHG emissions. The aim of this strategy is to minimise the adverse impact of transport on the environment while addressing current and future transport demands based on sustainable development principles.
Transport systems form the backbone of South Africa’s socio-economic activities by enabling the movement of people and goods. However, emissions from the transport sector account for 10.8% of the country’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with road transport being responsible for 91.2% of these GHG emissions. South Africa has pledged a GHG emissions reduction target of 34% by 2020 and 42% by 2025.
1.6. Cabinet approved that the Department of Home Affairs can reopen the reapplication process for the current Zimbabwean Special Permit holders, under certain conditions. The initial Special Dispensation for Zimbabweans was approved in April 2009 to document Zimbabwean nationals who were in South Africa illegally.
2. Bills
2.1. Cabinet approved publication of the Deeds Registries Amendment Bill of 2017 for public comments. It amends the Deeds Registries Act, 1937 (Act 47 of 1937), so as to improve and enhance application and implementation of the Act. The Bill will also streamline and enhance the administration and registration of deeds.
2. Bills
Cabinet expressed its condolences to the families of the two soccer fans who lost their lives during the stampede. The President has constituted a Ministerial Committee of Enquiry to investigate the circumstances that led to this tragedy. The Committee is headed by Minister of Sports and Recreation Thulas Nxesi.

1. Issues in the environment
1.1. As we celebrate Women’s Month, Cabinet wishes Ms Getrude Shope well in her 92th birthday. MmaShope, as she is affectionately known, is a doyen of the struggle for liberation and for women emancipation in particular. She is a recipient of Isithwalandwe/Seaparankwe, the highest honour awarded by the African National Congress to those who made an outstanding contribution and sacrifice to the liberation struggle.
Cabinet also extended its well wishes to Ms Zondeni Veronica Sobukwe on her 90th birthday. South Africa is a better country through the sacrifices played by women of her ilk.
As the country celebrates Women's Month under the theme “The Year of OR Tambo: Women United in Moving South Africa Forward”, Cabinet joins all South Africans in honouring the brave women who marched to the Union Buildings in 1956 to protest the pass laws.
In the spirit of OR Tambo’s ‘Flowers of the Revolution’ statement, we commemorate the role of women as pioneers of the women's movement in this country, recognising that when you empower a woman, you empower the nation.
As a country we have achieved a lot in the field of women empowerment. Prior to 1994 Parliament had a mere 2,7% representation of women, and following the first democratic elections, women representation in the National Assembly stood at 27,7%. In 1999 that figure increased to 30% and then to 32,7% in 2004. After the 2009 national elections women representation reached 42%. Women Ministries now comprise 43% of the Cabinet.
1.2. South Africans across the board have worked very well to participate in this commemoration. Government’s progressive policies continue to prioritise the empowerment of women, particularly those living in rural areas, who often bear the harsh realities of poverty.
1.3. As we celebrate the progress we have made in the emancipation of women, Cabinet reminds the country of one of the woman anti-apartheid activists who was killed on this day in 1982. Ruth First was brutally killed by a letter bomb sent to her in Mozambique. She paid the ultimate sacrifice in her relentless pursuit of freedom for the people of South Africa.
Gender-based violencence
1.4. Cabinet has added its voice to the condemnation of a video showing a schoolgirl being attacked by a male pupil at a school in KwaZulu-Natal and welcomes the arrest of the suspect. The recent killing of a school teacher shot in front of her pupils by her partner reminds us of the challenges we still face of the abuse of women.
1.5. The harms and dangers of patriarchy which result in the violence against women and children should be fought by all of us as a society. The law-enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system must deal decisively against the perpetrators.
SADC Summit
1.6. South Africa, as incoming chair of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), is hosting the 37th Ordinary SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government from 9 to 20 August 2017 under the theme: “Partnering with the Private Sector in Developing Industry and Regional Value Chains”.
South Africa will use its position to strategically advance the country’s national interests as outlined in the National Development Plan (NDP), drive regional and continental industrialisation and integration to boost the implementation of Africa Agenda 2063 of the African Union (AU). Agenda 2063 is the strategic framework for the socio-economic transformation of the continent over the next 50 years. It builds on and seeks to accelerate the implementation of past and existing continental initiatives for growth and sustainable development.
Three potential growth paths, namely agro-processing, mineral beneficiation and downstream processing value chains, have been identified.
The summit will also pay tribute to the outgoing President José Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, who will be stepping down after 37 years as President and leading his country out of a protracted civil war.
1.7. Deputy President Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the SADC Facilitator to the Kingdom of Lesotho, will also table a report to the SADC Double Troika Summit taking place in Pretoria on 18 August, where the Lesotho Government is also expected to table a reforms roadmap. This follows the consultations between the Deputy President with the new government, leaders of opposition parties, the college of chiefs and civil society stakeholders in the Kingdom, charting the path for the full implementation of SADC decisions on constitutional and security sector reforms.
1.8. Cabinet welcomes the outcomes from President Jacob Zuma hosting President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of the Republic of Liberia, during a State Visit. Both countries agreed to look into improving an enabling environment to ease the manner of doing business in our respective countries. Cabinet encourages more private sector companies to invest in Liberia.
The parties also agreed to finalise the signing of a Visa Waiver Agreement for Holders of Diplomatic and Official Passports. They also agreed to speed up discussions and finalisation of other bilateral instruments on agriculture, tourism, health, energy water and sanitation amongst others.
1.9. Cabinet congratulates the people of Rwanda on the holding of a peaceful election that saw the re-election of President Paul Kagame. The conclusion of yet another successful poll in Africa is a clear indication that democratic advances continue across the continent.
1.10. Cabinet also joined the AU in congratulating Kenya for conducting successful elections. It is now incumbent on all citizens in Kenya to accept the results of the elections and to work towards national unity in the country.
BRICS
1.11. President Zuma will today, 17 August 2017, preside over the official launch of the African Regional Centre of the Brazil, Russia,India, China and South Africa (BRICS) New Development Bank (NDB) at the Michelangelo Hotel, Sandton. The launch of the African Regional Centre will showcase the NDB’s service offering, highlighting the bank’s potential role in the area of infrastructure and sustainable development in emerging and developing countries.
1.12. South Africa is among the BRICS member countries that adopted a Seven-Point Action Plan focused on expanding industrial cooperation, at a BRICS Industry Ministers meeting held in Hangzhou, China. These countries will further cooperate in fields such as the development of new industrial infrastructure, technology development and innovation, and small and medium-sized enterprises.
1.13. Communication Ministers from the BRICS group also participated in a round-table, with the group publishing a Ministerial Declaration on Information Technology, that BRICS nations will step up cooperation on information security, as digital communication technology plays an increasingly important role in driving economic growth.
1.14. Cabinet thanks the former Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Mr Tito Mboweni, for his professionalism and dedication during the two-year period that he served as a non-executive director of the BRICS NDB. National Treasury Director-General, Mr Dondo Mogajane, will take over.
Social cohesion
1.15. Cabinet condemns recent acts of racism by some individuals in our society. Such behaviour goes against the ethos of our constitutional rights, responsibilities and values, and has no place in our democratic society.
We all have a responsibility to act swiftly whenever racism and discrimination occurs within our society. We all have a responsibility to build a new nation as envisaged after the first democratic elections.
1.16. Cabinet raised its concern about the state of job losses in the country, particularly in the retail and mining sectors. However, it welcomed the efforts made by the mining sector to engage in dialogue that seek to save jobs. The recent approval of Lonmin’s application to acquire Anglo Platinum‘s 42,5% stake in Pandora – a joint venture between Lonmin and Anglo Platinum – is welcomed. This joint venture has in turn saved more than 3 000 jobs and is a relief, especially in the current global economic climate. Government remains committed to creating an environment that is conducive to economic growth and job creation.
1.17. Cabinet welcomed the court decision that reaffirmed the prerogative of the government to make policy decisions and directives by dismissing with costs an application by the Metal Recyclers Association of South Africa. The Constitutional Court dismissed an application by local exporters of scrap metal for leave to appeal the judgement of the High Court of South Africa and the Supreme Court of Appeal.
The Court has upheld the State’s scrap metal export provisions known as price-preference for domestic foundries, mini-mills and secondary smelters scrap metal. It provides for a price discounted by 20% to international prices before qualifying for an export permit. This policy will help to reindustrialise the country’s economy and create jobs.
1.18. Cabinet welcomed the commitment by the Canadian Government to cooperate with South Africa in border management. This came after the Minister of Home Affairs, Prof Hlengiwe Mkhize, met with her Canadian counterpart Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizen Mr Ahmed Hussen this week. This exchange will further strengthen the existing relationship between the two countries.
2. Cabinet decisions
2.1. Cabinet approved the Mandate Paper for the 2018 Budget. This will further drive the implementation of the NDP. The paper strengthens the alignment of the budget to the Medium Term Strategic Framework. It establishes a systematic basis for making choices among competing priorities within limited resources. The Minister in The Presidency, Mr Jeff Radebe, will hold a media briefing at a later stage.
2.2. Cabinet approved the Coastal and Marine Tourism Implementation Plan, developed under the auspices of the Operation Phakisa Oceans Economy. The plan will uplift tourism in the ocean economy. It will grow a world-class and sustainable coastal and marine tourism destination that leverages South Africa’s competitive advantages in nature, culture and heritage. The Minister of Tourism, Ms Tokozile Xasa, will hold a separate media briefing to unpack this plan.
South Africa will use its research vessel SA Agulhas II to conduct marine research while training and building scientific capacity for South Africa and East Africa.
The gathering of basic long-term environmental data and information will place the developing countries of the Indian Ocean Rim in a better position to conserve the integrity of its ocean and to find ways to unlock their respective potential ocean economies to improve the lives of their citizens.
It will provide a further opportunity for the South African chemical industry to identify manufacturing niches that are associated with Green Chemistry (the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the generation of hazardous substances).
These communities have cited a number of reasons for these requests, such as the geographic location and access to services. The requests were received by the Municipal Demarcation Board and Department of Corporative Governance.
Provincial boundaries are provided for in the Constitution. Any consideration of such requests should be done within the constitutional framework.
3. Upcoming events
3.1. Cabinet reiterates President Zuma’s call, reminding members of the public to nominate persons from all walks of life deserving to receive the country’s highest honours, the National Orders, in April next year.
The ceremony honours South Africans and eminent foreign nationals who have excelled in various fields.
Nominations forms are available on The Presidency’s website (www.thepresidency.gov.za), Thusong Service Centres, municipal offices and constituency offices. A short motivation of the person nominated should be attached. The 2018 National Orders nominations will close on 31 August 2017.
3.2. The Department of Science and Technology will host the 2017 South African Women in Science Awards (WISA). The awards recognise the achievements of prominent scientists and create a platform for the motivation of women scientists participating in research.
The WISA will be hosted under the theme: “Women’s economic empowerment in the changing world of work”, which is in line with the United Nations Commission on the Status of women priority theme for 2017.
3.3. Cabinet thanks the members the Fifth National House of Traditional Leaders (NHTL) whose terms come to an end. The NHTL is a body composed of traditional leaders who are delegates from the provincial houses of traditional Leaders of South Africa, representing the provincial houses at national level. The group comprised of both outgoing members of the NHTL and members who have been re-elected to serve for one more term. They represent traditional leadership and their communities and promote the role of traditional leadership within the constitutional dispensation.
4. Messages
4.1. Cabinet congratulates Ms Senamile Masango who became the first African woman to conduct the first African-led experiment at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research laboratory in Switzerland. She was part of a group of student researchers from the University of the Western Cape studying the isotope selenium-70 to better understand how its nuclei shape relates to its energy levels.
4.2. Cabinet congratulates People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA), who have developed an App that helps survivors of gender-based violence, in distress or imminent danger, to have access to integrated and coordinated services. With a link to the Department of Social Development’s Command Centre, the App can link to other services like the police and social workers, who can be able to identify the location where the message originates.
Through a press of a panic button on the mobile, a victim will be linked to the Command Centre. This collaboration between government and non-governmental organisations will go a long way towards fighting the scourge of abuse.
4.3. Cabinet congratulates Team South Africa for their outstanding achievements on the track and field at the International Association of Athletics Federations World Championships in London.
Caster Semenya won gold in the 800m and bronze in the women’s 1 500m, in the process breaking her personal best record. Semenya has done the country proud and amidst the negativity, she remains strong and resilient. She follows in the footsteps of Zola Budd, Natalie du Toit, the paralympian, and Penny Heyns, the swimmer. Wayde van Niekerk won gold in the men’s 400m and silver in the 200m. A special word of gratitude to the coach, Ms Anna Botha. Luvo Manyonga won gold medal with his leap of 8.34m in the men’s long-jump final, Ruswahl Samaai won bronze in the men’s long jump, and Akani Simbine came fifth-place in the men’s 100m final.
Their performances showcased the sporting prowess of our nation, which is an inspiration and motivation to all South Africans, especially young budding athletes.
These athletes did our nation proud and carried our national flag with distinction. We call on South Africans to continue supporting all our national teams, as well as our sportsmen and women. They are an embodiment of our great nation, and we have no doubt that they will inspire other young people to follow in their footsteps.

1. Issues in the environment
1.1. Cabinet welcomed the outcomes of the 37th Southern African Development Community (SADC) Ordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government held in South Africa from 9 to 20 August 2017 under the theme: “Partnering with the Private Sector in Developing Industry and Regional Value Chains”.
The strategy seeks to change the structure of the economies of the region and promotes value-addition with focus on agro-processing, mineral beneficiation and pharmaceuticals. The summit emphasised the need to have concrete outcomes that leverage on our national endowments.
Cabinet joins President Jacob Zuma in thanking His Majesty King Mswati III, the outgoing Chairperson of the SADC, for his valuable contribution and leadership, as South Africa assumes the role of chair of the SADC from August 2017 to August 2018.
1.2. Cabinet salutes all women, and extends heartfelt thanks to those who participated in celebrating and commemorating women as we close Women’s Month, under the theme: “The Year of OR Tambo: Women United in Moving South Arica Forward”.
Although women have made important gains in South Africa, more needs to be done and government programmes will continue to prioritise the involvement of women in developing our communities, the economy and country. Women still continue to face unacceptable levels of abuse and violence, poverty, unemployment.
1.3. Cabinet noted the Poverty Trends Report released by Statistics South Africa and will engage with it. Cabinet reiterated its commitment to its pro-poor programmes, particularly as it relates to children coming from poor households.
Over the last 23 years, government has increased the social grants programme to poor and vulnerable communities from 2, 7 million to 17 million people. This programme covers over 91% of eligible children and 95,5% of the eligible old age people. Over 20 000 schools have been declared no-fee schools, with over nine million learners benefiting from the school nutrition programmes.
The National Student Financial Aid Scheme has since 1999 disbursed more than R72 billion in loans and bursaries to students from poor households. This has resulted in more than two million students from poor communities accessing tertiary education. A total of 1,7 million children are accessing registered Early Childhood Development services, which is a critical foundation for education. In 2012 government also introduced a school health programme, which is an intervention to some of the barriers that hinder progress in some of the learners.
Additionally, government has a number of anti-poverty measures which provide free access to basic services to millions of indigent families such as free piped water, sanitation, free electricity and refuse removal. Government has also implemented public employment programmes and housing schemes to enable poor families to have houses.
Government will continue to find ways to strengthen some of the social security programmes that are designed to cushion the poor and vulnerable communities.
1.4. Cabinet commends the launch of the Ghana Radio Astronomy Observatory, by the Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo and South Africa’s Minister of Science and Technology, Ms Naledi Pandor.
This is significant for Africa’s participation in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project. The observatory in Ghana is the first other than South Africa, as one of the partner countries.
As SKA Africa partners, the SKA South Africa/Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory group collaborated with Ghana to harness the radio astronomy potential of the redundant satellite communication antenna at Kuntunse.
A vital part of the effort towards building the SKA on the African continent over the next decade is to develop the skills, regulations and institutional capacity needed in SKA partner countries to optimise African participation in the project.
1.5. Cabinet welcomes the announcement from the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Ms Edna Molewa that South Africa is finalising in the outstanding three provinces, a verification and audits of all the existing privately owned rhino horn stockpiles.
This will assist in preventing the potential smuggling of illegally obtained rhino horns and will ensure that the country has full and accurate information on the number of horns in South Africa at any given time, as well as the registered owner of each one of such horns.
On the ruling by the North Gauteng High Court on the issuing of the permit on the selling of rhino horns to breeder Mr John Hume, which saw South Africa’s first online auction of rhino horn, Cabinet reiterates amongst several other operational conditions, that: the position permit holder, who must have acquired a sellers permit can only sell rhino horn to a person who has a buyers permit issued in terms of the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act, 2004 (Act 10 of 2004), authorising him/her to buy rhino horn from a sellers permit holder, in this case being Mr Hume.
The permit does not authorise international trade in rhino horn. International trade on horn remains banned, in terms of the provisions on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

During the National Women’s Month, the IDC approved funding of R3,2 billion for women-empowered businesses, an increase of 178% compared to the previous year.
Cabinet has full confidence in the institutional strength of National Treasury and its custodianship of public finances. Cabinet further expresses its faith in the IFMS programme’s implementing agencies – National Treasury, the Department of Public Service and Administration, and the State Information Technology Agency – to implement the project successfully.

Cabinet further expresses its faith in the IFMS programme’s implementing agencies – National Treasury, the Department of Public Service and Administration, and the State Information Technology Agency – to implement the project successfully.
1.8. Cabinet notes that National Treasury is overseeing a forensic investigation into alleged irregularities in the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) programme. Cabinet commends National Treasury for its robust internal audit controls, which identified irregular expenditure. It trusts that the appropriate lessons will be learned with respect to the challenges experienced, and any deliberate wrongdoing or negligence will be identified and the parties held accountable.
Cabinet has tasked the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster to investigate the leak of classified information and calls for relevant punitive measures to be applied to those responsible.
1.13. Cabinet is saddened by the loss of life on the country’s roads caused by persistent negligent, reckless and irresponsible drivers. Recently 13 children were injured after an alleged drunken driver crashed a taxi into a tree. Two weeks ago another incidence happened in KwaZulu-Natal, which resulted in 19 deaths and nine injured after a taxi crashed into a bridge.
This included funding for a transaction that places control of a large manganese mine in the hands of a black South African woman. Funding for black-empowered companies amounted to R10,1 billion, of which R4,7 billion was for investment projects led by black industrialists. These numbers underscore the progress made with transformation of economic ownership in the country. A total of 20 881 jobs were created or saved in the full IDC funding for the year, which amounted to R15,3 billion, the highest level yet.
1.12. Cabinet welcomes the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Flanders on promotion of the Social Economy in South Africa. The New Growth Path economic strategy adopted in 2010 identified the social economy as one of 10 job drivers.
1.11. Cabinet welcomes the setting up of a Market Inquiry into high data costs and notes the gazetting of the terms of reference by the Competition Commission. The Market Inquiry arose out of a request by the Minister of Economic Development in terms of the Competition Act. High data costs have serious economic effects, increases the costs of doing business and can limit the ability of South Africa to successfully utilise new information technologies. Cabinet supports the call on service providers in the sector to cut data costs.
Over the past five years from 2013, the IDC committed R68 billions of funding to investment projects. Together with private sector co-funding, this facilitated investments worth R200 billion and created or saved 99 000 jobs. Cabinet congratulates the IDC and the Economic Development Department on this performance at a time when efforts to boost investment and job creation are critical.
More departments, private sector and research institutions have invested a great deal of technology and innovation in their respective developmental programmes.
As a way of further strengthening these achievements, Cabinet approved three opportunity areas identified by Department of Science and Technology to support in the health technologies, defense and security related technologies and social infrastructure in respect of technology.
Cabinet also endorsed additional work of tracking and measuring the development of technology and innovation in social and economic development.
3. Bills
3.1. Cabinet approved for the introduction of the Overvaal Resorts Limited Bill of 2017 into Parliament.
The focus of the Bill is to repeal Aventura’s founding legislation, the Overvaal Resorts Limited Act, 1993 (Act 127 of 1993). This will enable the completion of the disposal of Aventura. Cabinet took the decision to dispose of Aventura after it considered it as a non-core asset in government. The Bill went out for public consultation in March 2017.
3.2. In aligning legislation with developments in the education landscape, Cabinet approved for the publication of the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill of 2017 in the Government Gazette for public comment.
The Bill is the outcome of the review of all basic education legislation with a view to enhancing organisational efficiency so as to improve school governance, leadership and accountability, transforming education services, and protecting vulnerable groups to ensure the well-being of learners.
Amendments were proposed to the South African Schools Act, 1996 (Act 84 of 1996), and the Employment of Educators Act, 1998 (Act 76 of 1998).
4. Upcoming events
4.1. In September we will mark Heritage Month, Tourism Month, Arbor Week, Public Service Month, National Development Plan (NDP) Month and Thusong Service Centre Week. Further details on these events will be communicated by the relevant departments.
4.2. As the chair of the SADC, South Africa has offered to host the SADC ICT Ministers Meeting from 4 to 7 September 2017 to discuss progress made on the implementation of the SADC Communications and ICT Programme.
Minister Ayanda Dlodlo and Minister Siyabonga Cwele will lead the South African delegation in this meeting. The meeting is to provide guidance on strategic communications and ICT issues and also track implementation of decisions made at previous meetings. South Africa will use the meeting to promote access to affordable ICT infrastructure services, thereby positioning the country as a regional infrastructure hub and promoting small, medium and micro enterprises under the overall SADC industrialisation and regional integration agendas.

4.3. The 9th Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) Summit will take place in Xiamen, China from 4 to 5 September 2017. The theme of China’s BRICS Chairpersonship is: “BRICS: Stronger Partnerships for a Brighter Future”.
Total bilateral trade between South Africa and other BRICS countries amounted to US$29 billion in 2016. South Africa’s biggest export destination within BRICS remains China, followed by India, Brazil and then Russia. The same pattern is also evident in imports, with China remaining the biggest source of imports.
The 2017 BRICS Summit will feature five key priorities namely, deepening cooperation, strengthening global governance, undertaking people-to-people exchanges, advancing institutional improvements and building broader partnerships.
The strategic focus for South Africa in BRICS is to promote value-added trade, attract investment into the country’s productive sectors and enhance cooperation to advance our development objectives.
4.4. Cabinet noted the participation of South African companies in the 53rd edition of the Maputo International Trade Fair, commonly known as FACIM, which is taking place in Mozambique from 28 August to 3 September 2017.
FACIM is an international multi-sectoral trade fair held annually to showcase Mozambique as an attractive destination for trade and investment. Twenty companies were funded by the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) while 10 were supported by the Mpumalanga Economic Growth Agency. The companies represented various sectors including chemicals, agro-processing, clothing and textile, engineering, mining and capital equipment, and electro-technical and built environment sectors.
Mozambique is South Africa’s third largest trade partner in the SADC region, after Botswana and Namibia. Trade between the two countries increased from R29 billion in 2012 to R43 billion in 2016. There are currently 300 South African companies operating in Mozambique.
The participation of the South African companies in FACIM received a particular recognition during last week’s Binational Commission as one of the platforms that business communities in the two countries can use for engaging on possible cooperation and partnerships for increasing trade and investment between our countries.
4.5. The Minister of Home Affairs, Professor Hlengiwe Mkhize, will participate in the Ministerial Migration Dialogue for Southern Africa to be held in the Kingdom of Swaziland from 2 to 4 September 2017. The overall objective of the event is to foster dialogue among SADC member states to improve migration governance in the region. Issues to be explored include statelessness, migration, border management and labour migration.

Cabinet met on Wednesday, 27 September 2017, at the Union Buildings, Pretoria.
1. Issues in the environment
1.1. United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)
Cabinet welcomed President Jacob Zuma’s address to the 72nd Regular Session of the UNGA in New York, USA on 12 September 2017, under the theme “Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet”.
Deliberations focused, amongst others, on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); climate change; peace and security issues and UN reforms, especially UN Security Council reform.
President Zuma also signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which reflects South Africa’s continued commitment towards the achievement of a world free from the threat posed by nuclear weapons and ensuring that nuclear technology is used for peaceful purposes only.
President Zuma hosted a centenary celebratory dinner in honour of the late former President of the African National Congress, Mr Oliver Reginald Tambo.
1.2. Heritage Month
Cabinet thanks all South Africans for celebrating Heritage Month in September and reiterates President Zuma’s Heritage Day message for all in the country to aspire for greater unity in diversity.
As the country concludes Heritage Month under the theme “The Year of Oliver Reginald Tambo: Celebrating our Liberation Heritage”, South Africans are encouraged to build on the values espoused in the Constitution and strengthen efforts to build a nation free from poverty, hunger, homelessness and inequality.
In fostering a spirit of heritage, Cabinet welcomes the agreement signed between South Africa and Tanzania, which is aimed at preserving the history of the liberation struggle.
The UN has endorsed the implementation of the Roads to Independence in Africa Project. It is a celebration of the spirit of solidarity and cooperation amongst Africa’s liberation movements and will see the construction of a museum, library and archives.
1.3. World Tourism Day
This provides a platform to support changes in policy, business practices and tourism consumer behaviour, towards a more sustainable tourism sector, which can contribute aggressively towards the attainment of the SDGs. During World Tourism Day, different countries and cultures celebrate a multiplicity of region-based activities such as the promotion of special tariffs and/or broadening access to facilities, mass-based free access to parks and gardens, and various engagements with stakeholders.
South Africa has been successful in promoting tourism through its various attractive facilities such as our parks, blue flag beaches, and the world accredited heritage sites. Tourism’s labour absorption capacity remains a great weapon against unemployment. As a tourist destination, South Africa faces the prospects of growing its transversal tourism sectors to enable massive economic potential through the so-called traditional dominant tourism economic sectors. These include rural, medical, agro and cultural tourism.
1.4. Antiretroviral pricing agreement
Cabinet welcomes the ground-breaking pricing agreement reached by the Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, in collaboration with a number of international organisations, to accelerate the availability of the first affordable single-pill HIV-treatment regimen.
It is estimated that the price reduction will result in savings of up to R11.7 billion over the next six years. This will enable South Africa to enrol more patients on treatment.
The pricing agreement makes the medicine Dolutegravir, which is recommended by the World Health Organisation, more affordable for governments in low and middle-income countries.
In light of the pricing agreement, the Department of Health plans to introduce the new fixed-dose combination of three drugs, Tenofovir, Lamivudine and Dolutegravir in April 2018.
Cabinet calls on all sexually active South Africans, especially youth, to continue to live a healthy life which adopts preventative measures such as continuously practising safer sex by abstaining, being faithful and condomising, and regularly testing for HIV.
1.5. Health
Cabinet welcomes the unveiling of the new wing of the Cecilia Makiwane Hospital in Mdantsane, East London. It is a milestone towards the implementation of the National Health Insurance that will result in the provision of quality healthcare, particularly to poor communities.
This world-class tertiary hospital is an investment to realise the National Development Plan’s (NDP) vision and the UN’s SDGs of universal healthcare.
The 526-bed hospital is supported by an integrated system that will optimise delivery of quality healthcare. It applies technological innovation to reduce patient waiting times, improve diagnosis and enables a quicker health intervention in patients.
This R1 billion investment infrastructure will support local economic development in the townships. As we revitalise public health infrastructure, we are also expanding opportunities for local communities to improve their lives through job creation and local enterprise development.
1.6. Social Development Month
Cabinet calls on South Africans to continue to uplift those less fortunate than themselves ahead of Social Development Month in October.
Social Development Month is held annually to commemorate the many strides the country has made, in providing social assistance to the poor and the most vulnerable in South Africa.
President Zuma will officially launch the commemoration of Social Development Month on Friday, 29 September 2017.
Cabinet warmly wishes all senior citizens and older persons a happy Older Persons Day, which will be commemorated on Sunday, 1 October 2017.
South Africans are encouraged to use October month to recognise the role and prime sacrifice older persons made in attaining freedom in our country. It is the duty of all fellow citizens, not only government, to give extra care to our older persons and vulnerable groups.
The South African Government’s social-assistance programme is built on a firm belief that social-security assistance is a basic human right and is key to restoring the dignity to its citizens. Social grants bring financial relief to millions of households and working together with government uplifts the vulnerable so that their living conditions improve with dignity.
1.7. Examination preparations
Cabinet wishes all learners well, especially those in Grade 12, as they prepare for their final end-of-year examinations.
The Department of Basic Education (DBE) is on schedule for the matric exams starting on the 16 October 2017 that will be written by more than 798 000 registered learners.
The DBE is providing additional support to matriculants with onsite learning after school hours, and during weekends and school holidays.
Cabinet calls on parents and guardians to avail the necessary support to learners as they prepare for exams.
1.8. Annual Thusong Service Centre Week
Government successfully concluded this year’s Annual Thusong Service Centre Week, which took place from 18 to 22 September 2017 under the theme: “The Year of OR Tambo – Advancing Small Medium and Micro Enterprises at Thusong Service Centres”.
This formed part of Public Service Month and promoted the Thusong Programme by showcasing the integrated mobile outreach programme and its effectiveness in responding to the needs of the citizens. Thusong Services Centres bring a basket of government services and information closer to the people.
The programme reaches approximately six million beneficiaries every year through the Integrated Mobile Outreach Programme, the Annual Thusong Service Centre Week and other Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) platforms.
Through this programme, government continues to redress the imbalances of the past by bringing quality public services closer to communities previously marginalised from the mainstream of socio-economic development.
Thusong Service Centres also empower communities with the necessary skills and training to better their lives, through existing partnerships with government, parastatals and the private sector.
Cabinet reiterates the call to communities to continue using Thusong Service Centres to access basic services such as Home Affairs, Labour, Justice, South African Social Security Agency and the Road Accident Fund.
1.9. Myanmar
Cabinet is concerned about the plight of Rohingya civilians who have fled their homes in Myanmar.
South Africa supports the statement by UN Secretary-General, Mr António Guterres, who emphasised the responsibility of the Government of Myanmar to provide security to all affected communities, and further request for humanitarian agencies to be granted access to communities in need of assistance and protection.
Cabinet urges all parties to end the violence to avoid further human suffering and appeals that situation in the Rakhine State be resolved with the ambit of the law.
1.10. Angola
Cabinet joins President Zuma in congratulating the Republic of Angola on conducting successful National Legislative Elections. President Zuma attended the Inauguration Ceremony of President João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço in Luanda on Tuesday, 26 September 2017.
South Africa and the Republic of Angola share a common history of the struggle against colonialism and apartheid. Since 1994, the two countries have continued to grow and expand strong bilateral ties.
Angola is one of South Africa’s largest trading partners on the African continent and continues to grow its bilateral relations.
1.11. Attack on tourists from Netherland
Cabinet condemns the recent robbery of tourists from the Netherlands who were followed from OR Tambo International Airport. All South Africans should condemn such crimes which threaten our ever growing tourism sector. Cabinet further called on the South African Police Service to do whatever it can to apprehend the perpetrators of this crime.
Cabinet appeals to the public to come forward with any information that may assist law-enforcement authorities and calls for the full might of the law to be applied to those found guilty.
1.12. Launch of the Bakoena Ba Mopeli customary law book
Cabinet applauds the launch of the book, Bakoena Ba Mopeli Customary Law of Succession and Genealogy, as a milestone achievement for traditional leadership in South Africa.
The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Mr Des van Rooyen, and His Majesty King Letsie III, the Head of State of the Kingdom of Lesotho, attended the event on Monday, 25 September 2017.
The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs started documenting the history of 13 Kingships/Queenships in 2011. This book will assist in understanding the history of Bakoena Ba Mopeli and succession genealogy in order to preserve our history.
2. Cabinet decisions
2.1. Southern African Development Community (SADC) protocol
Cabinet approved the ratification of the SADC Protocol on Environmental Management for Sustainable Development, by Parliament. The objective of the protocol is to promote sustainable use and transboundary management of the environment, which is of interest to SADC member states.
South Africa, as Chair of the SADC from August 2017 to August 2018, is committed to strengthening regional efforts to conserve transboundary natural resources and promote sustainable development within the SADC region.
This is aligned to the NDP, which prioritises the deepening of integration of the SADC region as well as ensuring environmental sustainability and an equitable transition to a low-carbon economy.
2.2. Partnership for Action on the Green Economy Ministerial Conference
Cabinet approved the hosting of the Partnership for Action on the Green Economy Ministerial Conference in September 2018. This platform supports countries and regions to put sustainability at the heart of economic policies and practices to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
It is a UN programme which brings together expertise from five UN agencies namely; UN Environment Programme; International Labour Organisation; UN Development Programme; UN Industrial Development Organisation and the UN Institute for Training and Research.
Hosting the Ministerial Conference will advance the agenda, domestically and on the African continent, of inclusive growth in adopting a low carbon and climate resilient economic pathway.
2.3. Umngeni Water Board
2.3.2. Cabinet was appraised on the situation at the Umngeni Water Board which is the second largest water board in the country with an annual turnover of more than R2,4 billion and its five year Capital Expenditure budget of more than seven billion rand. Cabinet was also briefed on the discussions the department of water and sanitation was having with its investors.
2.3.1. In order to stabilise the governance issues of the Board Cabinet endorsed the appointment of the Interim Board whilst the Minister is expediting the process to appoint the fully fledged Umngeni Water Board. Cabinet was satisfied with the work that the Minister was doing in stabilising the Umngeni Water Board.
3. Bills
3.1. Land Survey Amendment Bill
Cabinet approved the publication of the Land Survey Amendment Bill for public comment. The Bill amends the Land Survey Act, 1997 (Act 8 of 1997).
The amendments enhance lines of accountability and governance and provide for the appointment of certain members of the Survey Regulations Board, so as to enhance the regulation of the survey of land in South Africa.
The Bill also seeks to regulate the survey of land in South Africa by empowering the Chief Surveyor-General to exercise national oversight and management over the geodetic, topographic and cadastral surveys, geospatial and land information services.
3.2. Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill of 2017
Cabinet approved the publication of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill of 2017 for public comment. The Bill proposes harmonising and standardising the provisions which regulate the operations and governance of the public entities reporting to the Minister of Science and Technology. This will ensure consistency in all requirements to be met and processes to be followed by the entities as they relate to governance.
4. Upcoming Events
4.1. Transport Month
As October 2017 marks Transport Month under the theme: “Together we move South Africa Forward”. Cabinet calls on all to work together to ensure the country’s transport infrastructure benefits all and encourages road users to take responsibility and apply road safety as part of their daily lives. By working together we can reduce carnages on our roads.
During Transport Month, government – led by the Department of Transport and its entities – will highlight the economic benefits of the sector by showcasing transport infrastructure services in aviation, maritime, public transport, roads and rail. The national launch is being held at Sinaba Stadium in Daveyton in the City of Ekurhuleni on 29 September 2017.
Investments in the transport sector are stimulating development and creating jobs as part of South Africa’s Nine-Point Plan, which aims to grow the economy and create much-needed jobs. These investments will ensure the building of an integrated public transport network across the country.
4.2. South Africa to host the 2nd Session of the South Africa-Zimbabwe Bi-National Commission (BNC)
South Africa and Zimbabwe have good bilateral political, economic and social relations underpinned by strong historical ties dating back many years.

In 2016, South Africa’s exports to Zimbabwe amounted to approximately R29.3 billion.

1. Issues in the environment
1.1. Economy
1.1.1. Cabinet welcomes the positive growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017, which has moved the country out of a technical recession. Last week, Statistics South Africa released the figures, which represent a year-on-year growth of 1.1%.
1.1.2. Although cautiously optimistic, Cabinet is convinced the country is seeing the first positive signs of what is hopefully the start of the country’s economic recovery firmly built on the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan, which aims to grow the South African economy and create much-needed jobs.
This has resulted in the launch of four industrial parks and the rise in net exports of agricultural raw products on average by 14.6% a year since 2012.
1.1.3. The Black Industrialist Programme has supported 62 projects that have attracted R26 billion in private-sector investment and created 19 859 jobs to date. To support localisation, 21 products and sectors have been designated for local production.
1.1.4. Cabinet reiterates calls to all sectors of society, particularly government, business and civil society, to build on the positive momentum gained during the second quarter to sustain higher rates of economic growth and development, and to help save jobs.
1.1.5. The Minister of Finance, Mr Malusi Gigaba, continues to engage with various sectors on the inclusive economic growth action plan, which is set to inspire confidence in the country. The Minister will further unpack this when he delivers the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement in Parliament, Cape Town, on 25 October 2017.
1.2. InvestSA One Stop Shop – Western Cape
1.2.1. Cabinet commended the launch of the first provincial InvestSA One Stop Shop.
President Jacob Zuma officially launched the InvestSA One Stop Shop in the Western Cape and affirmed government’s commitment to improving the investment climate in South Africa, which is an attractive destination for potential investors.
1.2.2. The InvestSA One Stop Shop lowers the cost of doing business and eases doing business in the country by providing strategic guidance, reducing regulatory inefficiencies and cutting red tape for investors.
1.2.3. Government’s National InvestSA One Stop Shop was launched in March this year and through the dti, InvestSA One Stop shops will be established in all nine provinces – first in the Western Cape and followed by KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng respectively.
1.3. 5th Anniversary of the National Development Plan (NDP)
1.3.1. Cabinet joins South Africans in celebrating the 5th Anniversary of the NDP, which was adopted by Parliament on 12 September 2012 as the country’s socio-economic development blueprint to tackle the triple challenge of poverty, unemployment and inequality by 2030.
1.3.2. As the country’s roadmap towards prosperity, the NDP belongs to all South Africans and represents the hopes and aspirations from all sectors of society, for a better South Africa.
1.3.3. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to rally behind the NDP Vision 2030.
1.4. BRICS Summit
1.4.1. Cabinet noted a successful 9th Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) Summit, held in Xiamen in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) from 3 to 5 September 2017 under the theme: “BRICS: Stronger Partnership for a Brighter Future”.
1.4.2. The summit sets an important milestone towards building stronger solidarity and cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
1.4.3. South Africa’s partnership in BRICS is premised on advancing the country’s national interests, promoting regional integration and advocating a more inclusive global governance system.
1.4.4. Total bilateral trade between South Africa and other BRICS countries amounted to US$29 billion last year. South Africa’s biggest export destination within BRICS remains China, followed by India, Brazil and Russia. The same pattern is also evident in imports, with China remaining the biggest source of South African imports. Even though South Africa has abundant natural resources, it is critical to implement beneficiation programmes to support our industrialisation policy.
1.4.5. The adoption of the BRICS Xiamen Declaration and Action Plan highlighted the strong foundation that BRICS has made in terms of establishing institutional mechanisms for tangible cooperation.
1.4.6. Cabinet is honoured that South Africa is the incoming Chair of BRICS and entrenches its aim at the forefront to build on the BRICS programme of development and prosperity for partner countries, as it prepares to host the 10th BRICS Summit in 2018.
1.5. South Africa and Russia sign agreement

1.5.2. South Africa’s national oil company, PetroSA, and the Russian Federation geological exploration company, Rosgeo, have agreed to develop the exploration areas of blocks 9 and 11a off the South Coast of South Africa.
1.5.3. The search for oil and gas resources in South Africa is highly strategic for the country’s energy security.
1.5.4. Russia’s Rosgeo will conduct geological exploration work as well as drilling exploratory wells. The project could lead to four million cubic metres of gas being extracted daily and subsequently delivered to PetroSA’s Gas-To-Liquids refinery in Mossel Bay, on the South Coast.
1.6. South African export markets
1.6.1. Cabinet congratulates the dti in leading a group of 20 South African companies to the World Food Moscow 2017 exhibition, which is underway until 15 September 2017.
1.6.2. While promoting South Africa’s agro-processing industry, the participation of these local companies from the agro-processing sector, consolidates and establishes market presence of South Africa in Russia.
1.6.3. Their participation is made possible through the Export Marketing and Investment Assistance Scheme of the dti, which is instrumental in developing export markets for South African products and services, as well as recruiting new foreign direct investment into the country.
1.6.4. Trade between South Africa and Russia increased significantly from R5 billion in 2012 to almost R8 billion in 2016. Major South African exports include fruits and nuts, manganese ores, beverages, spirits and vinegar, wine, electrical machinery and equipment.
1.7. Child labour
1.7.1. Cabinet is concerned about recent incidents of child labour in which children were found working on farms in the North West and Free State. Cabinet condemns this unacceptable abuse and exploitation of vulnerable children.
1.7.2. Cabinet commends members of the public who alerted the Department of Labour which, together with the Department of Social Development, acted swiftly to deal accordingly with this heinous form of child abuse.
1.7.3. Cabinet is pleased that the affected children have been relocated to places of safety and that the Department of Labour will intensify inspections and work together with law-enforcement agencies to bring perpetrators to book.
1.7.4. Our children are the future of the country. Cabinet condemns all forms of child labour and calls on all South Africans to remain vigilant at all times and report those violating the principles of our Constitution.
1.7.5. The South African Schools Act, 1996 (Act 84 of 1996), together with the Children’s Act, 2005 (Act 38 of 2005), clearly directs that all children between the ages of seven and 15 are compelled to attend school.

Cabinet supports the initiatives announced in the MTBPS to guide the economy through these difficult economic times, achieve inclusive economic growth and efficiently use state resources.
1.2. Cabinet thanks the more than 4, 5 million taxpayers who submitted their tax returns during the 2016 Tax Season and reminds all non-provisional taxpayers who still have to submit a tax return to do so as the deadline for submission on 25 November 2016 is fast approaching.
Patriotic taxpayers are helping to improve the lives of millions of South Africans by partnering with government as it rolls out much needed services and social support across the communities.
Cabinet calls on South Africans to join our efforts in growing the economy by creating new jobs, and adopting a culture of saving. Working together we can ensure that we boost economic growth.
Cabinet supports calls for a quick and effective investigation into the alleged hostage situation at the South African Revenue Service. Incidents such as these have a negative impact on public confidence in our law enforcement authorities and need to be quickly addressed.
1.3. Funding higher education remains a priority for government and the additional R17 billion allocated to universities over the next three years will help to further ease the burden on financially needy poor and missing middle students. This funding will also ensure that more students are able to access higher education as R9.2 billion of this funding will be allocated to NSFAS.
The Ikusasa Student Financial Aid Programme makes various recommendations which are currently under consideration for implementation. The proposed model and recommendations contained in the report, will go a long way in not only addressing the funding problems faced by poor and “missing middle” students, but also in addressing amongst other challenges which South Africa faces, including:
Government believes that dialogue to address the demands of students can take place while the academic programme is underway. We reaffirm the right to protest but this must be done within the confines of the law and in a manner that does not infringe on the rights of others.
Government grants and tuition fees account for the bulk of university income, with government spending accounting for 43 per cent of university income and tuition fees accounting for 34 per cent. These findings demonstrate government’s commitment to education and reaffirms our call for those who can afford to pay their fair share, and reveals that tuition fees remain an important part of overall funding.

Progress has also been made by the Ministerial Task Team appointment by the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Blade Nzimande, to develop a support and funding model for Poor and “Missing Middle” students. A blueprint entitled the Ikusasa Student Financial Aid Programme (ISFAP), underwent an engagement process, which saw various inputs incorporated, and agreement obtained across all key stakeholders for the future governance structure of ISFAP.
The Ikusasa Student Financial Aid Programme makes various recommendations which are currently under consideration for implementation. The proposed model and recommendations contained in the report, will go a long way in not only addressing the funding problems faced by poor and “missing middle” students, but also in addressing amongst other challenges which South Africa faces, including:
• Reducing the high dropout rates of poor and working class students in the higher education and training sector,
• Reducing the high dropout rates of poor and working class students in the higher education and training sector,
• Improving the skills profile of the country,
• Improving the partnership between government, the private sector and higher education institutions in supporting poor and “missing middle” students.
The ISFAP blueprint provides poor and “missing middle” students financial assistance to cover the full cost of study. While recommending a fully subsidized education to the poor in the form of bursaries and grants, it also proposes progressively reducing bursaries and grants to the “missing middle” students as household income increases and sketches scenarios of how this can be achieved by mobilising funds from both the public and private sectors.
1.4. The launch of the Tourism Enterprise Development Incubator, in Pilanesberg in the North West by the Minister of Tourism Derek Hanekom, will create a conduit for economic inclusion through viable tourism businesses.

2. Key Cabinet decisions
2.1. The Special Cabinet of 1 November 2016, received progress reports on the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on State Owned Companies (SOC) Reform, chaired by Deputy President, Cyril Ramaphosa.
This emanates from the implementation of Cabinet endorsed recommendations from the 2010 Presidential Review Commission of SOCs. Cabinet reaffirmed the phased approach to implementation of these recommendations.
Cabinet reiterates that all state owned entities must be efficient, and financially viable.
A suite of decisions was taken to pursue the central policy objective of strengthening SOCs to enable them to meet their developmental objectives.
• Cabinet endorsed a Private Sector Participation framework for infrastructure delivery which will guide collaboration between SOCs and the private sector.
• Cabinet adopted the guideline for the remuneration and incentive standards for directors of SOEs.
• Cabinet endorsed the broad thrust of a guide for the appointment of boards and executive officers, for which, the Department of Public Service and Administration will undertake a consultation process with provinces and municipalities, before Cabinet approval.
• The first draft of a new government shareholder policy was recommended for further consultation. This will culminate in the promulgation of an over-arching SOC legislation.
• National Treasury developed a proposal for determining and costing developmental mandates of state enterprises, the introduction of this approach will help streamline commercial and non-commercial activities of SOCs.
These better position the SOCs to contribute towards the implementation of the National Development Plan: building infrastructure, growing the economy, expanding industry, helping develop high-end skills, creating jobs and advancing other transformation objectives.
2.2. Cabinet approved that the Integrated Energy Plan (IEP) be published for public discussion to afford stakeholders and interested parties to engage with it. The IEP is anchored in the National Energy Act, 2008 (Act No. 34 of 2008). It seeks to guide future energy infrastructure investments and policy development which will shape the future energy landscape of South Africa.
Integrated energy planning is required to ensure that current and future energy service needs can be met in the most efficient and socially beneficial manner, while controlling economic costs, serving national imperatives such as poverty alleviation and job creation and minimising adverse impacts on the environment.
The IEP provides a long-term vision of how South Africa can use energy optimally as a mechanism to remain competitive, which inherently requires a shift in how various energy resources are utilised.
2.3. Cabinet amended its decision of 10 June 2015 to designate the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation as the implementing Agent for the Nuclear New Build Programme. This decision, at the time, allowed Eskom to focus on the Medupi, Kusile and Ingula projects and the energy challenges the country was experiencing.
Cabinet designated Eskom as the Owner Operator and Procurer for Nuclear Power Plants in accordance with the Nuclear Energy Policy of 2008. Eskom has more than 30 years of safe operation of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Plant, which is also the only Nuclear Power Plant in Africa, and has been developing the Environmental Impact Assessment and nuclear Site Safety Reports for possible nuclear power plants since 2007.
Cabinet also approved designating the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation as the Owner Operator and Procurer for Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Multi-Purpose Reactor.
The Department of Energy will continue to act on its mandate as the policy setting and coordinating department of the Nuclear Build Programme.
2.4. Cabinet was briefed on the progress regarding the update of the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) and approved that public consultation be undertaken on the base case and assumptions.
Since the IRP 2010-30 there has been a number of developments affecting the energy sector. The IRP update process balances a number of objectives to ensure security of supply so as to minimise cost of electricity, to promote job creation and localisation, to minimise negative environmental impacts, minimise water use and to diversify supply sources.
The first milestone which is the compilation of assumptions to be used in the IRP has been completed, pending public consultation. The second milestone on the development of the base case which is a least cost plan has been completed. The third milestone which is a scenario analysis is underway. And the fourth milestone, is policy adjustment.
2.5. Cabinet received an update on developments in the negotiating position at the World Trade Organisation and agreed on the need for a development focus in the post-Nairobi work programme and in preparation for Eleventh Ministerial Conference of the WTO (MC11) to be held in Argentina in December 2017.
This is in line with the National Development Plan’s objectives of developing appropriate policy responses in a dynamic global environment.
2.6. Cabinet was briefed on the resolutions taken by the President’s Coordinating Council meeting held on 11 March 2016. This is a statutory body established in terms of the Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act, 2005 (Act No13 of 2005), which brings together the three spheres of government on matters of common interest and national importance with a view to strengthening co-operative governance.
Issues which were discussed included: Implementation of the Back to Basics Programme, progress report on the establishment of newly re-determined municipalities; government’s response to drought and water shortages; and review of South African Immigration Regulations, 2014.
2.7. Cabinet approved publication of the draft White Paper on Fire Services, public comments. It outlines key policy proposals and options that form the basis for a reviewed fire services legislation that will replace the outdated Fire Brigades Services Act, 1987 (Act No. 99 of 1987).
This resonates with the Back to Basic approach, by placing an obligation on fire services to constantly engage with communities they serve to work together to reduce fire risks and ensure adequate response strategies and systems to respond to fires and other related incidents rapidly and effectively.
The White Paper repositions the fire services from response orientated fire services towards a fire risk reduction based approach. This contributes to effective integrated disaster management and fire services, by placing fire safety and prevention, particularly community-based fire risk reduction, at the centre of fire services delivery which will significantly contribute to the creation of safer communities as highlighted in the National Development Plan.
3. Bills
3.1. Cabinet approved the introduction of the Road Accident Fund Amendment Bill, 2016 in Parliament. The Bill amends the Road Accident Fund Act, 1996 (Act No 56 of 1996) which provides for the payment of compensation for loss or damage wrongfully caused by the driving of motor vehicles.
The Bill is aligned with the National Development Plan and with Outcome 13 which provides for an inclusive and responsive social protection system by ensuring efficient service delivery and early medical intervention to assist with recovery and return to work, and no-fault cover to ease the financial burden on those who are disadvantaged.
4. Upcoming events
4.1. Members of the Executive across the three spheres of government will interact with South Africans countrywide during the National Imbizo Focus Week between 7 and 11 November 2016, under the theme “Together we move South Africa forward: “Our future – make it work”.

5.2. Cabinet was briefed on the impact of the drought on water supplies in South Africa with a particular focus on Gauteng which is supplied with water from the Integrated Vaal River system.
5.1. The decision by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to withdraw fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan brings the matter to finality and allows the country to direct all efforts to advance the economy, build investor confidence and avert an international credit rating downgrade.
5.2. Cabinet was briefed on the impact of the drought on water supplies in South Africa with a particular focus on Gauteng which is supplied with water from the Integrated Vaal River system.
South Africa received the lowest rainfall since 1904 (114 years) with extremely high temperatures experienced in October and November of 2015.
It could take at least two to three years to see any significant recovery in dam capacity and this could even extend to five years. We are therefore still in for a long road to recovery.
This system also provides water to the bulk of the ESKOM coal fired power stations, SASOL, irrigation users and mines and industries in Eastern Mpumalanga, North West, Free State and Northern Cape, thus supporting approximately 45% of the country's economy and 35% of the population. 80% of the water from the Vaal system is used by domestic consumers.
This is the third week that the system is below 50% during this drought. The Vaal Dam is now at 26.4%, Katse dam is at 38.4%, Sterkfontein Dam at 91.5% and Grootdraai Dam is at 66.3%. Restrictions of 15% for urban use and 20% for irrigation use have been imposed as published in the Government gazette on 12 August. These restrictions are mandatory.
A Technical Task Team has been established to monitor the implementation of the restrictions. Rand Water is the main supplier of potable water into Gauteng and the target is to reduce the supply from Rand Water by 687 million litres per day.
It is important that all consumers comply with the restrictions to make sure that we can stretch our available water supplies. The province of Gauteng is setting up a Joint Operations Centre (JOC) to monitor and ensure compliance. All Municipalities have also been directed to establish operation centres with immediate effect and to ensure that communication with consumers is improved.
The Vaal dam will be kept at 25% and this will be achieved by transferring water from Sterkfontein dam. This is necessary to protect the integrity of intakes for ESKOM, Rand Water and SASOL. Releases will commence on 7 November and continue for a minimum of 54 days to 30 December.
Cabinet calls on South Africans to use water efficiently and conserve it. All water users must adhere to water restrictions where they are being implemented, and continue to save water, working with municipalities. Government is doing all it can to mitigate against the current conditions and is working with all stakeholders in drought affected areas.
5.3. The African Union Commission Chairperson, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma hosted the engagement between African Editors and Press Officers from all 54 African Union member States, under the theme “Deepening Africa’s Narrative and Capacities to Deliver Agenda 2063”. Agenda 2063 calls for all segments of the African society and the African Diaspora to work together to build a prosperous and united Africa based on shared values and a common destiny.
Participants reflected on African Union milestones over the past four years, gained a better understanding of Agenda 2063 and how African media can be at the forefront of popularising and driving it. The role of accurate reporting in shaping an African narrative and advocating for media ownership amongst Africans was also discussed.
5.4. Cabinet joins in the commemoration of the life and times of OR Tambo as a demonstration of the respect and appreciation for the role he played in driving the agenda of a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa.
Cabinet congratulated the following:
5.5. Mamelodi Sundowns who are the new African football champions after winning the Confederation of African Football Champions League. Cabinet thanks all the supporters and all South Africans for rallying behind the team, which did South Africa proud. Sundowns joined another South African team, Orlando Pirates who won Africa's top club championship in 1995 to earn the country the first star of this competition.
5.6. The winners of 14th Annual Centre for Public Service Innovation Public Sector Innovation Awards who will go on to compete for the coveted Public Sector Innovator of the Year Award. The awards promote and encourage best practices in public sector innovation and celebrate the successes of individuals and teams at all spheres of government. It serves as a tool for expanding innovation and encouraging others to innovate for improved service delivery.
Cabinet conveyed its condolences to the following:
5.7. To the family and friends of the former Deputy Minister of Social Development, Ms Bongi Maria Ntuli who was a servant of the people and a dedicated gender activist.
5.8. Joins the President in extending condolences to the family and friends of photojournalist, Mr Juda Ngwenya whose iconic images documented our history and compelled us to have conversations about the wellbeing of our country and continent.
5.9. To the family and friends of Abram Thuri Phago who died when two trains collided on the rail split near Tembisa in Johannesburg and wishes those who were injured a speedy recovery. The Department of Transport will be working with Prasa and Railway Safety Regulator to fast track the Board of Inquiry into the full investigation to determine the root cause of the accident to prevent a recurrence of such fatal accidents.
5.10. To the family of Tshwane University of Technology student leader Lesego Benjamin Phehla who died as a result of an accident in Soshanguve.

9. Cabinet approved the introduction and implementation of the Public Service Graduate Recruitment Scheme Framework. This forms part of the development programme within the Public Service to attract talented graduates into the Public Service.
The framework includes earmarking a percentage of each department’s vacant posts for the recruitment of graduates in scarce occupations. The Minister of Public Service and Administration will also align this framework to the Youth Employment Service Programme.
10.

B. Issues in the Environment
14. GDP Growth Results
Cabinet is pleased with South Africa’s economy growth which grew by an annualised 2% in the third quarter of 2017, from an upwardly revised 2.8% in the second quarter. The stronger-than-expected performance was mainly due to continued strong growth in the agriculture sector, which contributed 0.9 percentage points to overall growth on the back of 44.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth.
Strong performance in agriculture, which has seen three consecutive quarters of robust growth, was due to higher production of field crops (such as maize) in summer rainfall areas and horticultural products. Mining and manufacturing also contributed to the growth recorded, with mining and quarrying increasing by 6.6% and contributing 0.5 percentage points to growth.
The electricity sector was the biggest laggard, down by 5.5%. Growth in household consumption of 2.6% was mainly due to spending on durable goods, which accounted for 1.6 percentage points of the 2.6% increase. Stronger-than-expected growth and the upward revision to the second quarter growth outcomes means growth could reach 0.9 per cent in 2017.
This is higher than the 0.7 per cent anticipated at the time of the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement. Government needs to ensure that this growth momentum is maintained by continuing to implement the 14 confidence-boosting measures that build on improving consumer confidence and can restore business confidence.
15. InvestSA One-Stop Shop
Cabinet welcomes the launch of the InvestSA One-Stop Shop in KwaZulu-Natal by President Jacob Zuma as part of efforts to improve the ease of doing business in South Africa. This is the third One-Stop-Shop launched in the country. It aims to create a conducive environment by providing a focal point of contact for investors to obtain all services to fast-track projects and reduce government red-tape when starting a business.
16. South Africa-Angola relations
Cabinet welcomes the agreements signed during the State Visit to South Africa by Angolan President João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço. The following agreements were signed: Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the creation of a Presidential Binational Commission, MoU on Cooperation in the Field of Environment, Implementation Guidelines for the visa waiver, Protocol on Police Cooperation and an Agreement on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters.
17. Fifth AU-EU Summit
Cabinet welcomes outcomes from the Fifth Summit of the AU-European Union (EU). The summit provided an opportunity for South Africa to enhance strategic economic and diplomatic relations through various engagements in the summit and in side events such as the Business Forum and Youth Summit, with a focus on inclusive economic growth, youth employment and entrepreneurship.
18. Slave trade of African migrants
Cabinet joins the international community in condemning the reports of auctioning of African migrants in Libya as slaves. Such inhumane acts go against the ideals of the AU, and relevant African and international instruments, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.
Cabinet welcomes the announcement by authorities that they will set up a transit and departure facility in Tripoli for refugees and migrants in need of international protection.
19. Outbreak of Listeriosis
Cabinet appeals to all people to take the necessary precaution – such as washing their hands before preparing food and avoiding raw or uncooked foods – to curb the spread of Listeriosis, whilst investigations continue to establish the source of the bacteria.
The disease is caused by a bacteria found in soil, water, vegetation and non-pasteurised dairy products, and may result in flu-like symptoms with diarrhoea. It can be successfully treated with antibiotics, if detected early.
Cabinet calls on South Africans to continue using water sparingly as the country still continues to experience drought/. Notwithstanding the recent rains, the dam levels nationally continue to decline. This is due to the high temperatures as well as that we did not as yet have consistent rains.
Cabinet is encouraged by the progressive negotiations with the highly indebted municipalities towards finding a solution to the municipal debt.
C. Bills
20. Cabinet approved the submission to Parliament of following Bills:
20.1. Social Assistance Amendment Bill of 2017.
The Bill provides improved benefits with respect to child support grants for orphaned and vulnerable children, including those residing in child-headed households.
20.2. Property Practitioners Bill of 2017
The Bill repeals the current Estate Agency Affairs Act, 1976 (Act 112 of 1976). It creates an enabling regulatory environment to enhance economic activity within the real estate industry while also addressing a need to ensure transformation in the sector.
20.3. National Qualifications Framework Amendment Bill of 2016
The Bill strengthens the current National Qualifications Framework Act, 2008 (Act 67 of 2008). It introduces measures to deal with issues of misrepresentation and imposes consequences on persons who misrepresent their qualifications or organisations that issue qualifications that are invalid.
20.4. International Crimes Bill of 2017
The Bill provides an improved legislative framework to deal with international crimes committed in South Africa and across our border. It also provides improved protection and justice for victims of international crimes.

1. Implementation of Key Government Programmes
1.1. Cabinet wishes all students well as they embark on their final year examinations. The Class of 2016 are encouraged to stay focussed as they embark on 2016 National Senior Certificate Examinations which officially starts on 24 October 2016 and ends on 29 November 2016.
1.2. Cabinet wishes to reiterate its call for the country to support all efforts to save the 2016 academic programme. These efforts led by government through the Ministerial Task Team working with students, parents, universities and stakeholders are a demonstration of our collective commitment to find solutions to normalise our higher education sector.
Cabinet shares the sentiments expressed by students with regards to the challenges they face on high costs of tuition fees, accommodation, textbooks, transport and living expenses.
If the academic year is lost, the universities and colleges do not reach a finality this year, almost a million matriculants will not be admitted into higher education, in 2017. The ripple effect is such that all students from first year to final year would be affected and ultimately our economy as no new skilled graduates will enter the job market.
Consequently, those who would have graduated as medical doctors, engineers, accountants, teachers and various professions will no longer be in a position to enter the economy.
Cabinet fully supports the rights to education that are contained in our Freedom Charter and Constitution, and prioritised in the National Development Plan. We further support the right to access higher education, particularly for the poor.
The Freedom Charter says “higher education and technical training shall be opened to all by means of state allowances and scholarships awarded on basis of merit.”
The Constitution further states “Everyone has the right to further education which the state through reasonable measures must make progressively available and accessible.”
In appreciation of the magnitude of the challenges in higher education, President Jacob Zuma has further broadened the composition of the Ministerial Task Team with the inclusion of Minsters of Communications, Human Settlements, Finance and Social Development.
Government has received several proposals that have been put forward by various constituencies and stakeholders. A technical process is underway to evaluate them and once work is completed, options will be provided to address the current challenges.
Government will further take steps to make resources available to all NSFAS qualifying students progressively to cover the full costs of study at universities and TVET colleges over the long term. Government will also develop mechanisms to address the challenges faced by “missing middle” students who don’t qualify under current NFSFAS rules but are unable to afford the full cost of study without some form of assistance. All of these will be phased at a pace and scale that depends on the rate of growth in enrolment and available resources.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education and Training is continuing with its work and will assist government to come up with a long term solution for access to higher education particularly for the poor.
The Minister of Finance will table the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement on 26 October 2016 that will set out the broad fiscal framework over the medium term.
In the 2016/17 financial year, government has allocated a tremendous amount of resources to higher education, which saw the Department of Higher Education and Training receiving a budget allocation of R49.2 billion.
Cabinet believes that it is only through our investment in education as a country that we will make meaningful progress in addressing the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality. Government has responded to the pleas of students and will subsidise the 2017 fee adjustment of up to 8%, to pay the fee increase through a gap-funding grant on behalf of all poor, working class and so called “missing middle” students, i.e. students with a family household income of up to R600 000 per annum. This means that both NSFAS qualifying students and “missing middle” students will experience a no fee increase, as government will pay the percentage fees adjustment. This subsidy will amount to about R2.5 billion, which covers over 70% of all undergraduate students.
All stakeholders must immediately work towards creating conditions and a conducive climate for the academic programme to resume without delay. To ensure the progressive realisation of the right to further education, government will develop a roadmap, working with relevant stakeholders, for the transformation of universities and TVET colleges to create opportunities for access, success, financing and support for students and institutions. Several stakeholders including among others students, banks and business have presented different proposals on how we can finance higher education particularly for the poor. Therefore, Ministerial Task Team will bring all stakeholders under one roof to develop a roadmap that will pave way for a solution.
Cabinet welcomes the resumption of classes in many of our universities, and urges all students to return to class. This is a critical period for the academic programme with examinations around the corner. Government believes that the concerns of students can be addressed through dialogue while the academic programme is underway.
Cabinet remains concerned at the outbreak of violent student protests on some university campuses around the country. While the right to protest is protected under the Constitution, there is no room for the violence, intimidation and the destruction of property.
All stakeholders must do everything in their power and take every steps necessary to save the academic programme as the consequences facing are will be dire to the economy, students and matriculants. Education is everyone’s responsibility, let us all work collectively together to bring about normality to higher education for the future of our children and for the future of our country.
1.3. Cabinet welcomed the R3 billion investment by Marriot International that will see the world’s largest hotel group complete five new hotels. The announcement demonstrates the investor confidence in the country and positive future prospects of the local economy.
1.4. South Africa was named as the best country for debt management and sovereign bond issuance in sub-Saharan Africa by Emerging Markets Newspaper, an affiliate of the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings. The award comes after the World Bank acknowledged the country’s excellence in debt dynamics/composition. These accolades are a testament to the success the country continues to enjoy in global capital markets and the prudent manner in which the economy is managed.
1.5. The first Kenyan State Visit by a South African head of state, President Jacob Zuma, since democracy, included a business delegation to the Kenya-South Africa Business Forum, which explored investment and trade opportunities. The following Memorandums of Understanding were signed: police cooperation, biodiversity conservation and management and the Lamu-Port Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor.
1.6. The Second Session of the Bi-National Commission between the South Africa and the Republic of Namibia underscored our collective commitment with a range of bilateral, regional and international issues being reviewed. The Memorandum of Understanding on Higher Education has been finalised, including the signing of the Terms of Reference of the Joint Committee of Experts on the Orange River Boundary.
1.7. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa’s working visit to Vietnam and Singapore was used to unlock future areas of trade and investment, and to attract Singaporean State Owned Enterprises to invest in South Africa through Public Private Partnerships, in line with South Africa's Nine-Point Plan. Commitment was also secured for Singapore to assist South Africa with skills development and to increase the number of training courses for South African students offered under the Singapore Co-operation Programme.
1.8. President Jacob Zuma addressed the annual South African Heads of Mission Conference which provided a platform for all our heads of mission to share ideas on issues and priorities which better enables them to continue representing our country. As our representatives abroad they have a responsibility to build friendships and partnerships that will help us achieve our goals from the National Development Plan, that of inclusive growth, jobs and a decent life for our people.
1.9. In responding to the needs of communities and businesses, Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane will turn the sod for the construction of Phase One of the R18 billion Vaal Gamagara Water Project, this Friday, 21 October 2016. On completion of Phase One, beneficiaries will include 14 livestock farms, 12 mines, solar parks, and the communities of Kathu, Olifantshoek, and Hotazel, benefitting a population of 23 499.
1.10. The launch of the R49-million first phase of the revitalised Isithebe Industrial Park in Mandeni, KwaZulu-Natal, forms part of the Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme of the Department of Trade and Industry, and has been prioritised for renewal.
The aim is to regenerate state-owned industrial parks across the country in order to promote industrialisation and increase their contribution to job creation and the country’s economic growth. Industries operating from Isithebe contribute significantly to the economy of the area, providing over 20 000 jobs. During the revitalisation programme 15 small micro medium enterprises were appointed for the project to the value of R6.3 million with 162 people employed.
1.11. The announcement, that South Africa will benefit from a new trade deal with the European Union (EU), will see improved access for South African products having preferential market access in the EU. The Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) under the SADC-EU EPA framework replaces the trade provisions of the existing bilateral trade agreement between South Africa and the EU, known as the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA). The EPA provides new market access for sugar and ethanol as well as improved market access for wines, flowers, dairy and fruit products.
1.12. The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna has increased South Africa’s Total Allowable Catch of the Southern Bluefin Tuna allocation from 150 tons to 450 tons for the 2018-2020 fishing seasons. This is essential to South Africa’s job creation priorities as it will provide permanent employment in the fisheries sector and will inject much needed export revenue for the country.
1.13. The appointment of successful bidders by the Department of Energy for the first Coal-based Independent Power Producer Programme (IPP) is a critical part of government’s initiative to secure the country’s energy supply. The two successful bidders will add 863.3MW to the energy grid in the next five years.
The appointment attracts an investment of more than R40 billion which will be used to unlock infrastructure in the energy sector, stimulate local procurement and create 6 613 jobs during construction and 13 524 through operations.
While South Africa’s energy build plan incorporates the development of fossil fuel assets, the country is committed to the transition of a low-carbon economy, with priority to clean energy alternatives. Through the Renewable Energy IPP, 6 376 MW of electricity have been procured from 102 Independent Power Producers in six bid rounds. Of this, 2 200 MW of electrical generation capacity from 44 IPP projects has been connected to the national grid.
1.14. As Transport Month unfolds a number of key transport infrastructure projects and initiatives are being rolled out to better connect people and places, which is creating new jobs and changing the way South Africans travel.
In this regard Cabinet recognises the R24 million investment by the Gauteng Department for Roads and Transport to repair the D904 road, which is also known as the old Evaton Road. The rehabilitation of the existing road will lead to improved travelling time, and will ensure better road safety for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.
1.15. The successful hosting of the Fifth Africa Internet Governance Forum in Durban saw the meeting finalise the continental position, which supports the attainment of the goals of Agenda 2063, ahead of the Internet Governance Forum to be held in Mexico in December 2016. South Africa signed the Multi-Party Administrator Service Agreement with the DONA Foundation.
1.16. The interventions by government to combat corruption, malpractices and hold industries accountable has led to an agreement with seven listed construction companies on a programme of initiatives, which will accelerate transformation in the industry. The agreement has a number of elements, including: Financial contribution for development projects; Transformational commitments in the sector; a Framework to settle claims by the public sector; and Integrity Commitments by Chief Executive Officers.
Key foundations of the agreement include a R1,4 billion fine imposed by the competition authorities which will be paid by the companies into the National Revenue Fund. A further R1,5 billion will be contributed to a fund to support social investment initiatives targeting previously disadvantaged communities.
A transformation commitment will be introduced by each of the seven companies, which may take the form of either an ‘equity model’, where at least 40% of the shares in the company will be sold to black South Africans; or the ‘partner model’ where a company will work with up to three black-owned construction partner companies’ to help them generate turnover equal to 25% of its own turnover. This commitment has been valued in excess of R9 billion annual turnover by the end of the agreement period.
An integrity commitment will be signed by each CEO that commits to wide-ranging steps to ensure no collusive or corrupt practices in the company, in its dealings with competitors, government or other private sector clients. The settlement agreement provides for certain formal processes to be finalised within the next few weeks and these are being processed and attended to and an announcement will be made on conclusion of these processes.

The information demonstrates implementation of Governments Programme of Action, as well as progress on the Medium Term Strategic Framework and implementation of the National Development Plan.
1.18. Cabinet also encourages South Africans to share their views on the economy and other issues they would like government to highlight in the upcoming Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTPBS), to be presented by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on 26 October 2016. Contributions can be sent through Facebook: National Treasury South Africa, Twitter @TreasuryRSA, oral representations and the National Treasury website.
2. Key Cabinet decisions
2.1. Cabinet approved the broad principles of the National Transport Master Plan 2050 (NATMAP) Synopsis Update Report, which is aligned to the National Development Plan and has the following strategic transport thrusts: long term planning and prioritisation, focusing on safety, reliability and affordability of transport; looking beyond transport as most inefficiencies and ills are the result of poor land use and planning; promoting behavioural change by changing the perception of public transport; and a developmental and socially inclusive planning approach.
2.2. Cabinet approved submission of the revised International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs), Dubai 2012, to Parliament for ratification.
The ITRs constitute an international treaty, and forms part of the Administrative Regulations of the International Telecommunications Union. The ITRs are aligned to the National Development Plan, in particular the promotion of economic growth and greater inclusion through the development of a stronger broadband and telecommunications network and lower prices.
2.3. Cabinet approved the submission of the World Radio Communication Conference (WRC-15) Final Acts, to Parliament for ratification, in line with Section 231(2) of the Constitution.
Key issues adopted at the WRC-15 include universal broadband roll-out, universal broadcasting roll-out, satellite communication services, aircraft services, maritime and the ocean economy programmes, disaster relief and emergency services, as well as future programmes to support economic transformation. WRC-15 outcomes also provides certainty to broadcasting service by protecting Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) spectrum.
2.4. Cabinet approved submission of the Final Acts of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Plenipotentiary Conference of Guadalajara 2010, to Parliament for ratification in terms of Section 231(2) of the Constitution.
The Plenipotentiary Conference is the top policy-making body of the ITU, which is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for managing the global system of electronic communications.
The work of the ITU is aligned to the National Development Plan, as it is strongly focused on the development of Economic Infrastructure in the ICT sector.
2.5. Cabinet was briefed on the progress made on the establishment and implementation of the Broadband War Room. The August 2016 Cabinet Lekgotla resolved that the Broadband War Room must be established to expedite the implementation of SA Connect, the national broadband policy.
As part of the Terms of Reference of the war room, several critical issues were identified that have a direct impact on the successful rollout of affordable, fast, reliable and secure internet. These include; addressing the delays in the allocation of high demand spectrum; broadband connectivity; rollout and funding; addressing ineffective market structures; fast-tracking digital broadcasting migration; development of e-government strategy; rationalisation of ICT State-Owned Entities; and capacitating the Regulator and addressing duplicity in governance of the ICT sector.
2.6. Cabinet approved that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change be submitted to Parliament for ratification. The Paris Agreement is a legal instrument that will further guide the process for universal action on climate change. It brings all nations into a common cause of acting collectively to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. It sets the goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
The Paris Agreement will enter into force on 4 November 2016, thirty days after the date on which at least 55 Parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least 55 % of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification.
South Africa's ratification of the Paris Agreement sends a positive signal of our continued commitment to contribute to the global effort to address the challenge of climate change.
2.7. Cabinet approved the Draft National Policy on Extension and Advisory Services and its implementation Plan. The Policy aims to set a regulatory framework to enhance the efficiency, productivity, equity, environmental and economic sustainability of the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors. This will ensure that all sectors in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries value chains (from producers to processors) are able to explore opportunities for the advancement of their enterprises and livelihoods.
2.8. Cabinet approved the final draft of the refined Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2014-2019 for Outcome 2 “A long and Healthy Life for All South Africans”. This serves as the building block to implement Chapter 10 of the National Development Plan 2030.
The MTSF 2014-2019 was refined to incorporate latest evidence of the health sectors actual performance against the targets in the MTSF 2014-2019; adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 by South Arica, and to reduce process indicators.
2.9. Following Cabinet approval, the Minister in the Presidency responsible for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Jeff Radebe will release the findings of the 2015 Management Performance Assessment Tool (MPAT). The report provides consolidated learning of the MPAT assessments and case studies analysis from 2011 until 2015.
MPAT has been implemented to facilitate reforms in managerial practices in government departments. This contributes to the National Development Plan which states that between now and 2030 South Africa needs to have established a state that is more capable, more professional and more responsive to the needs of its citizens.
The 2015 results show that MPAT has succeeded in facilitating incremental improvements in management practices; however, it varies across national departments and provinces. There are pockets of excellence with regard to management practices throughout government but weak managerial leadership practices remain a major challenge and contribute to administrative failures. Cabinet supports a more integrated and holistic approach to support improvements, which will be led by the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation.
3. Bills
3.1. Cabinet approved that the Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill be published for public comment. The Bill seeks to create the offences of hate crimes and hate speech and to put in place measures to prevent and combat these offences. The aim is to address the increasing number of racial incidents and to further address other types of criminal conduct motivated by bias, prejudice or intolerance, in the form of hate crimes and hate speech, which have occurred in the recent past.
This is aligned to the National Development Plan which highlights the need for sustained campaigns against racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia and that all people are and feel safe.
4. Upcoming events
4.1. Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October, represents a national effort by public and private health care to raise awareness of the disease. Early detection of the condition can lead to effective treatment. All women and men should conduct regular self-examination and undergo screening through their nearest health care facility.
4.2. The Department of Health will host the 40th World Hospital Congress of the International Hospital Federation (IHF) under the theme, "Addressing the Challenge of Patient - centered Care and Safety”, in Durban from 31 October to 3 November 2016.
The Congress provides a unique global forum which facilitates multidisciplinary exchange of knowledge, expertise and experiences in health sector management and service delivery.
5. Cabinet’s position on key issues in the environment
5.1. Cabinet has affirmed its support for Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan who under Section 35 of the Constitution is innocent until proven otherwise by a court of law.
Cabinet remains confident in the country’s criminal justice system and the fair and just judicial processes which have defined our democratic era. These processes must be allowed to take their course.
5.2. The outcomes from the 8th BRICS Summit, which was held from 15 to 16 October 2016 under the theme “Building Responsive, Inclusive and Collective Solutions (BRICS)” in Goa, India, saw BRICS leaders hold interactive roundtable discussions on strengthening intra-BRICS cooperation and reflecting on global issues such as international conflicts, the fight against terrorism, and reform of the global system of governance, notably the democratisation of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions.
The adoption of the Goa Declaration and Action Plan, highlighted the strong foundation that BRICS has made in terms of establishing institutional mechanisms for tangible cooperation. The possibility of setting up an independent BRICS Rating Agency based on market-oriented principles, in order to further strengthen the global governance architecture, was also welcomed.
During the visit to Goa, the Cipla Pharmaceuticals Company and the Dube Industrial Development authorities signed an agreement to establish a bio-logics facility. This R1.3 billion investment will result in the first plant on the African continent, producing affordable anti-cancer drugs based on bio-technology processes.
5.3. Cabinet pays tribute to the people of Mozambique for their solidarity and sacrifice in our struggle for freedom. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Minister of Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, attended the commemoration of the 30th anniversary service of the late Samora Machel, the founding father and President of Mozambique, who died under suspicious circumstances in Mbuzini. In honouring the memory of great African leaders like Samora Machel, Julius Nyerere, Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela, we remember that leadership to them meant dedicated service to Africa to advance the interests of the people of Africa.
We are building on our common history and enjoy strong diplomatic and economic relations to boost economic growth, create employment and reduce inequality. The creation of the Maputo Development Corridor, which links the port of Maputo with our country’s industrial heartland, is a vital part of our effort to promote trade and investment and foster regional integration.
5.4. Cabinet extends its good wishes to Advocate Busisiwe Joyce Mkhwebane on her appointment as Public Protector of the Republic of South Africa for a period of seven years with effect from 15 October 2016. Cabinet is confident that Advocate Mkhwebane will serve the nation well and will continue to act in the best interest of all South Africans.
5.5. Cabinet expresses its gratitude to Advocate Thuli Madonsela for serving the country and placing the office of the Public Protector uppermost in the minds of citizens.
5.6. Cabinet joins South Africa's media in commemorating the anniversary of Media Freedom Day known as "Black Wednesday" and commends the media industry for the role they have played in strengthening the country's democracy. On 19 October 1977, the apartheid regime ordered The World and Weekend World to cease publication and sparked the mass detention and banning of journalists.
Our democratic Constitution explicitly protects our hard fought media freedoms that are recognised as playing a critical role in the advancement of national unity and equality for all.
As we reflect on the progress South Africa has made in entrenching media freedom, Cabinet congratulates SANEF on its 20th anniversary which will be celebrated next week.
5.7. Cabinet extends the hand of solidarity to the people of Nigeria and to the families of the girls who remain in captivity, following the news that 21 of the 2019 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram militants have been freed. Cabinet calls on the international community to renew its efforts in assisting the Nigerian authorities to secure the girls' release; in particular for all African countries and the African Union to lend support to assisting Nigeria in finding the missing children.
5.8. Cabinet joins President Jacob Zuma in extending condolences to the Government and people of the Republic of Haiti and other nations in the Caribbean following destructive Hurricane Matthew that claimed the lives of hundreds of people and destroyed infrastructure.
5.9. Cabinet joins President Zuma in extending condolences to the government and people of the Kingdom of Thailand following the passing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
5.10. Cabinet also sends condolences to the family and friends of struggle icon Mewa Ramgobin. He founded the South African Committee for the release of Political Prisoners, and was among the first supporters of the Release Mandela campaign. Mewa Ramgobin was also the former President of the Natal Indian Congress and Chairperson of Phoenix Settlement Trust, founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1904.
5.11. Cabinet has noted that President Jacob Zuma has received and accepted the resignation of Mr Krish Naidoo and Mr Vusi Mavuso as members of the Board of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).
The Portfolio Committee on Communications has initiated steps to begin its inquiry into the Board of the SABC, with regard to its fitness to hold office, in terms of section 15A of the Broadcasting Act of 1999.
Cabinet congratulated the following:
5.12. South Africa’s Ambassador to Vienna Tebogo Seokolo on his appointment as Chair of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Board of Governors is the major policy-making organ of the IAEA.

1. Implementation of key government programmes
1.1. As government we are deeply committed to the upliftment of our people, hence education remains one of our apex priorities. We have demonstrated this through the allocation of resources, where Higher Education and Training was one of the biggest beneficiaries of this year’s national budget, receiving an additional 18% for 2016/17.
Despite economic difficulties we continue allocating resources as a demonstration of our support to broaden access to Higher Education, and education in general. Government this year provided R1.9-billion of the R2.3-billion shortfall resulting from the subsidisation on the 2016 increase. More than R4.5 billion has been reprioritised in the 2016/17 financial year to make it available to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme to enable poor students to access higher education.
1.2. Government is fully aware that an investment in the education of our children will contribute to a higher trajectory of economic growth, which is needed to address the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality.
Government has heard and responded to the pleas of students and will subsidise the fee adjustments for poor working and middle class university students for the 2017 academic year. Students whose parents or guardians can afford to pay for a university education must and should continue to do so, because education is a responsibility of all not only government.
1.3. The adjustment takes into account the issue of affordability for students and their parents, as well as the need to ensure that institutions of higher learning remain financially viable. The interim report by the Council on Higher Education proposed an inflation-linked fee adjustment across the board for 2017.
1.4. Government accepted the recommendation of a proposed 8% fee adjustment at universities and Technical and Vocational Education and Training colleges, while at the same time providing the gap funding to cover the adjustment for poor and missing middle students.
While the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education and Training Funding completes its work, our university system has to continue functioning, producing skills for the economy, and empowering young South Africans and students from countries around the world, in particular the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
1.5. Cabinet appeals to students and student leaders in particular, to raise their concerns appropriately according to the Constitution, which guides all South Africans. Recent violence marred student protests when the country witnessed vandalism, destruction of property, burning of libraries and now even the death of a university worker.
1.6. President Jacob Zuma has instructed the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster (JCPS) to deal with the mayhem that is destroying our institutions of higher learning. The President will be meeting with the Ministers from the JCPS Cluster later today. Law-enforcement agencies, who are acting within the confines of the law, will leave no stone unturned in finding those responsible for the criminal activities witnessed.
1.7. In welcoming the announcement by the Department of Basic Education that it is all systems go for the 2016 Grade 12 National Senior Certificate examination, we urge all stakeholders to work together to ensure that our institutions of higher learning are in a position to receive the Class of 2016 in order to secure a brighter future for our children. All stakeholders, especially parents and guardians, need to be actively involved in finding lasting solutions to the education funding challenge.
The Grade 12 examinations run from 26 October to 29 November 2016. The Minister of Basic Education will announce the outcome of the 2016 Grade 12 exams on 4 January 2017. For the 2016 examinations, there are 677 141 full-time and 150 183 part-time candidates, which is 9 000 more candidates than in 2015, demonstrating government’s commitment to ensuring that more of our young people complete their basic education so that they are able to participate in the economy. Cabinet wishes the Class of 2016 well as they embark on the final phase of their school careers.
1.8. As the world commemorates World Teachers’ Day on 5 October 2016, Cabinet applauds all our teachers and commends them for their dedication and hard work in laying the foundation for our future leaders. The dedication and resilience of our teachers has uplifted our people and continues to propel our children to a brighter future.
The Economy
1.9. Cabinet is encouraged by the outcomes of the continued engagement between government and captains of industry led by President Zuma through the Presidential CEO Initiative to build confidence in the economy, reignite economic growth and avert a sovereign credit rating downgrade.
Progress includes a youth employment programme to place one million youth in paid internships over three years in the private sector, including the establishment of a South African Small and Medium Enterprise Fund with R1,5 billion to invest in small enterprises. In line with government's Nine-Point Plan, work has also been done to analyse eight economic sectors and identify areas for new investment and growth.
Going forward business will partner with government through the following projects: establishment of an Agricultural Growth Fund; capacity to support tourism marketing; increasing the numbers of nurses trained; and the revitalisation of declining industrial areas, specifically in the Vaal Triangle.
1.10. Progress has also been made in implementing the National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Research, Development and Innovation Strategy (HySA Strategy). Cabinet approved the HySA Strategy in 2007 to create knowledge and enable the development of high-value commercial products in the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell technology sector through beneficiation of the country’s platinum group metal resources. This also holds the potential to advance localisation with a view to strengthen black industrialists. This South African innovation involves contributing to international innovation through technology commercialisation while capturing 25% of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell market, which translates to R1.37 billion in 2020.
1.11. Cabinet approved the introduction of the new regulation governing the relationship between the employer and the employee in relation to doing business with the State. The gazetted regulations bring into effect the Public Administration Management Act, 2014 (Act 11 of 2014).
1.12. The handover of the first 500 houses at the Savanna City Integrated Human Settlements Project, which was led by the Minister of Human Settlements, Ms Lindiwe Sisulu, is part of government’s efforts in providing decent housing to needy people and to help restore their dignity by ensuring that they enjoy the right to adequate and quality shelter. A total of 200 houses were handed over to military veterans. When completed in the next five years, the project will have over 18 000 houses, 500 of which will be allocated to military veterans.
1.13. The National Internet Governance Forum, and the Southern Africa Development Community Internet Exchange Point have been successfully launched by the Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Dr Siyabonga Cwele and African Union (AU) Commissioner Dr Elham Ibrahim.
The National Internet Governance Forum (AfIGF) developed a country position, in preparation for the Fifth AfIGF from 16 to 18 October 2016, in eThekwini, KwaZulu-Natal. The AfIGF will lead to lower costs to access the Internet in the region because the Internet traffic will circulate among African countries.
These developments underscore the importance that South Africa and the AU attach to meaningful participation in the Internet economy and not just as consumers. These also take us closer to creating a more inclusive digital economy and knowledge society, as envisaged in the National Development Plan (NDP). Government is committed to ensuring that the Internet is universally accessible to all South Africans, which contributes to the creation of an inclusive society.
1.14. The Africa Aerospace and Defence Air show and Defence Exhibition was successfully hosted by the Department of Defence, Armscor, SA Aerospace, Maritime and Defence Industry Association, Denel and the Commercial Aviation Association of South Africa. This platform allowed South Africa’s defence industries to market their capabilities to the international community, and this year also saw the largest number of exhibitors and national pavilions represented by various countries.
2. Cabinet’s position on key issues in the environment
2.1. Cabinet fully aligns itself with the statement issued by The Presidency on 23 September, on the matter of the Chief Operations Officer (COO) of the SABC. Cabinet respects the ruling of the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) confirming the setting aside of the appointment of Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng as COO of the SABC.
Cabinet calls on the SABC Board to abide by the letter and spirit of the SCA ruling. Attempts to subvert the SCA ruling through legally suspect interpretations border on violating the constitutional principle of legality and challenge the constitutionally assigned judicial authority of our courts. The decision to reappoint Mr Motsoeneng in a new position shows disrespect of a rule of law.
Cabinet reminded the Board of Section 165 of the Constitution: that an order or decision issued by a court binds all persons to whom and organs of state to which it applies. Cabinet directed the Minister of Communications, Ms Faith Muthambi, to urgently take steps to address this matter with the SABC Board.
2.2 Cabinet welcomes the outcomes from South Africa’s participation at the 71st United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), which was led by President Zuma. This took place from 20 to 26 September 2016 under the theme “The Sustainable Development Goals: A universal push to transform our world”.
During this session world leaders adopted the New York Declaration which expresses the political will and commitment to protect the rights of refugees and migrants. The commitments pave the way to negotiations aimed at an international conference and the adoption of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration in 2018.
Our country once again reiterated its call for the strengthening of the institutions of global governance, including the UN, specifically the Security Council and advocated for the urgent reform of these institutions with the aim of correcting the historical injustice against Africa reflected in outdated structures.
President Zuma co-hosted with President Francois Hollande, of France the UN High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth on 20 September 2016. The commission was established by the UN Secretary-General and it aims to engage leaders at the highest level to encourage the creation of new employment opportunities in the health sector globally. The Report of the Commission which was adopted by the General Assembly, makes recommendations to Member States, ranging from training needs, continuing education and the need to focus on primary health care. This includes a commitment to train 40 million health workers by 2030.
The official handover of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) leader chair position to France was done by President Zuma during the five-year anniversary event on the margins of the UNGA. During South Africa’s tenure as chair of the OGP we championed the Open Government Declaration on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which will see OGP member countries incorporating Sustainable Development Goals in their OGP countries’ action plans. South Africa also prioritised legislative openness, open data, and broadening civil society participation to include grass root organisation and vulnerable groups within the OGP.
3. Key Cabinet decisions
3.1. Cabinet was briefed on the assessment by the Academy of Science of South Africa on South Africa’s technical readiness to support the shale gas industry, including the recommendations on actions to be implemented by relevant departments. In the transition to low carbon technologies while improving energy security, South Africa is considering shale gas as a potential contributor to the country’s future energy mix.
The report, which will be released for public consumption, raises a number of issues that require attention in order to bring the country to a full state of readiness. These include: strengthening the regulatory, licensing and monitoring authorities, ensuring that South Africa has the requisite skills; supporting relevant companies to exploit the economic opportunities, putting in place measures that will protect natural resources, and commencing with research. The report will be used as the basis to develop the shale gas research, development and innovation plan.
3.2. Progress has been made on Operation Phakisa for Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development. Through Operation Phakisa government seeks to expand growth, with the view to make South Africa a food secure nation at all levels.
Since May 2016, extensive consultation sessions were conducted over a four-month period. The actual LAB is taking place over a five-week period from 25 September and 28 October 2016. The primary objective is to ensure the formulation of required and implementable interventions towards greater economic inclusion for the sector. Operation Phakisa: Agriculture and Land Reform seeks to create one million jobs, and plant one million hectares by 2019, as envisioned in the NDP.
3.3. Cabinet approved the Capacity-building Strategic Framework for District and Local Municipalities in support of the Agri-parks Programme. The Agri-parks Programme has become the cornerstone of government’s priority to Revitalise Agriculture and Agro-processing Value Chain, which is one of the priorities of the Nine-Point Plan. All 44 district municipalities have been included in this programme. This will position Agri-parks to serve as an important mechanism to execute the NDP’s proposed rural development strategy due to their potential for supporting small-scale agricultural production and stimulating agro-processing in rural areas.
3.4. Cabinet also approved the National Integrated Information Communication Technology (ICT) Policy White Paper, which replaces the separate White Papers on Telecommunications (1996) and Postal Services (1998).
This integrated ICT Policy outlines how government will ensure that the sector fulfils its potential to facilitate inclusive social and economic transformation in South Africa. The Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Dr Cwele, will convene a separate media briefing to further unpack this policy.
3.5. Cabinet approved the submission of the African Telecommunications Union (ATU) Convention of 1999 to Parliament for ratification in terms of Section 231(2) of the Constitution.
The ATU is an organ that promotes universal access in Africa and the use of ICTs – such as infrastructure roll-out, radio-frequency spectrum and standard-interoperability – on the continent.
South Africa’s participation is in line with the NDP and foreign policy objectives of better positioning country globally and strengthening the AU institution in order to fulfil the developmental foreign policy objectives.
3.6. Cabinet approved the proposed institutional framework for the establishment of the Multi-Primary Administrator of the Digital Object Architecture (DOA), with the proposed name being MISAVA Agency for Digital Identifier.
Implementation of the DOA has the potential to position South Africa by bolstering ICT competitiveness in readiness to participate in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
3.7. Cabinet approved South Africa’s revised position to the Southern African Development Community’s (SADC) proposal for the development of a memorandum of understanding regarding the establishment of the North South Corridor Management Institution (NSCMI).
The SADC Ministers of Transport agreed to establish an NSCMI to address operational inefficiencies and bottlenecks along the North South Corridor. Cabinet also approved for the Minister of Transport to host the North South Corridor Ministers of Transport meeting during 2016/17.
3.8. Cabinet was briefed on the development of a new series of commemorative and circulation coins that would represent culture, freedom and democracy, by the South African Mint and its Board of Directors, in conjunction, with the Minister of Finance.
Cabinet approved the introduction and designs of the new R10 and R5 Sterling-silver commemorative coins; the new R5 (1/2 oz.) 24-carat gold commemorative coin to the Natura Coin Series for 2017; and
a. Designs of the following commemorative coin series:
The 2017 Natura Coin Series;
The 2017 Sterling-silver Coin Series; and
The 2017 Sterling-silver R2 Crown and 2½ c Tickey series.
b. The following 2017 Krugerrand coins:
The re-issue of the vintage 1967 Krugerrand in 2016; and
Introduction of new Krugerrands to the collection in 2017.
4. Bills
4.1. Cabinet approved publication of the Social Assistance Amendment Bill of 2016 for public comment. This amends the Social Assistance Act, 2004 (Act 13 of 2004). The Amendment Bill seeks to provide for additional payments and/or benefits linked to social assistance. Amendments would enable the establishment of funeral benefits and additional benefits for orphans and children in child-headed households.
5. Upcoming events
5.1. Cabinet was briefed on South Africa’s preparations and approved the strategy for participation in the upcoming 8th BRICS Summit, being led by the BRICS Inter-Ministerial Committee. The 8th BRICS Summit will be held under the theme “Building Responsive, Inclusive and Collective Solutions (BRICS)” from 15 to 16 October 2016 in Goa, India.
Cabinet was also briefed on the status of operationalisation of the New Development Bank Africa Regional Centre. South Africa will continue to support the coming into operation of the BRICS New Development Bank, which includes hosting the Africa Regional Centre in Johannesburg.
The established first BRICS financial institutions, such as the New Development Bank and Contingent Reserve Arrangement serve as catalytic institutions to leverage industrialisation and infrastructure programmes in South Africa and the continent.
5.2. Cabinet approved the South African negotiating mandate to serve as the basis for engagement at the 28th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal MOP 28) to be held from 10 to 14 October 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda.

8. Bills
8. Bills
Cabinet met on Wednesday, 6 June 2018, at the Union Buildings, Pretoria.
A. Issues in the environment
1.Economy
The GDP results bring into sharp focus the need for all sectors of the country to work together to support South Africa’s local economy. Business and labour need to continue to work with government in support of initiatives such as the Nine-Point Plan to stimulate economic growth and create much-needed jobs. One of its key pillars is the Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP), which focuses on increasing manufacturing, employment creation and exports. Cabinet is confident that the IPAP will help grow our industrial sector and economy.
Later this year, government will host an International Investment Summit to profile South Africa as an investment destination. The aim of the event is to work towards generating R1,2 trillion in new investments over the next five years, which will have a significant impact on economic growth and employment creation.
2. Investments
Cabinet welcomes the launch of a new world-class factory that manufactures information and communications technology products in East London in the Eastern Cape on 5 June 2018 by Yekani Manufacturing, a wholly black-owned company. This R1-billion investment will create 1 000 new quality jobs in addition to the existing workforce of 450, mostly youth and women.
3. National Minimum Wage (NMW)
Cabinet welcomes the passing of the NMW Bill by the National Assembly. It expresses its appreciation to all stakeholders at the National Economic Development and Labour Council for their role in reaching this agreement. This begins a process towards narrowing the wage gap, especially for the low income earners. Approximately 6,4 million workers in South Africa will benefit once the Bill has been signed into law. Cabinet, however, acknowledges that more work still needs to be done to close the wage disparities that still exist in the country.
The Bill will now be sent to the National Council of Provinces for concurrence before the President signs it into law.
4. Basic services
Cabinet is pleased with the results of the Non-financial Census of Municipalities 2017 released by StatsSA. The results showed more consumers have received free basic services such as electricity, water and sanitation in 2017 as compared with 2016. Government remains committed to providing daily basic services to all its citizens, especially poor people. The most recent water-related project is the R96-million Mhlathuze Water Project in Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal, which will deliver running tap water to more than 6 000 households.
5. Public Service wage negotiations
Cabinet received a briefing from the Minister of Public Service and Administration on the Public Service wage negotiations. Cabinet appreciates the commitment by all stakeholders in finding an amicable solution that would benefit all role players. Cabinet reaffirms government’s commitment to fully engage with labour so as to arrive at a workable deal for all involved.
6. Social grants
Cabinet reassures beneficiaries of social grants that government will continue providing this important service, as mandated by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. Social grants will continue to be paid and the process to replace the old South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) card with the new one will continue until the end of September 2018.
The partnership between SASSA and the South African Post Office is yielding positive results as more beneficiaries have since May 2018 been coming forward to swap their cards.
Cabinet urges communities to ignore recent short messages directing social-grant beneficiaries to re-register for their social grants to avoid not being paid. Such misleading messages seek to create confusion amongst the poor and derail government from ensuring that social grants are seamlessly paid to beneficiaries without failure.
7. North West
Cabinet received a third progress report from the Inter-Ministerial Task Team (IMTT) on North West. Cabinet is satisfied with the progress made to operationalise the invoked Section 100(1) (a) and (b) in the North West provincial departments. It was further approved that the IMTT will onwards report to Cabinet once a month to enable the teams deployed in the province to continue with the work.
Cabinet endorsed a visit to the North West on 7 June 2018 to brief the North West Executive, Provincial Legislature and the external auditors responsible for the province.
8. Protest action
Cabinet condemns the recent violent protests around the country, and is especially saddened by the acts of violence and intimidation of patients and medical staff at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital. Protestors who exercise their rights to protest should do so without violating the rights of others, particularly the vulnerable. No amount of grievance justifies violence and the threatening behaviour seen in the past week.
9. Safety and security
Cabinet welcomes and supports the ‘stabilisation intervention plan’ by the South African Police Service (SAPS), which will partner with South Africans towards efforts to make our communities safer. The high-density visibility of uniformed police officers on foot and vehicles – supported by the SAPS air wing, continuous cordon and search operations, roadblocks and relentless search for wanted suspects – will go a long way in ensuring that people in our country are and feel safe.
Communities are encouraged to provide information relating to their safety to a local police station or call the toll-free Crime Stop number: 086 00 10111. Cabinet appeals to members of the public to use the Crime Stop line responsibly. An abuse of this facility may affect a legitimate emergency call that may have saved a life.
10. Youth Month
Cabinet urges all South Africans to play their part in youth-empowerment programmes and projects during Youth Month in June. This year is the centenary of Tata Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela and Mama Albertina Nontsikelelo Sisulu and Youth Month 2018 is embraced under the theme: “Live the legacy: Towards a socio-economically empowered youth”.
Inspired by their iconic legacies, young people need to be empowered to take up a more active role in developing their communities with a view to working together to develop South Africa. Government is working hard to ensure that youth are able to access the many support and educational government programmes that would enhance their participation in the economy.
11. Preliminary and mid-term exams
Cabinet calls on parents and guardians to support, within necessary means, children who are writing preliminary and mid-term examinations taking place across the country.
Cabinet warmly appreciates the vital role child caregivers play in shaping our future leaders whilst creating conducive and safe environments for our children to learn. We also encourage all learners to continue studying and striving to do their best.
Cabinet also welcomes the reopening of schools in various parts of North West, including Koster and Rustenburg. This comes after weeks of protests and disruptions in teaching and learning in the areas. Cabinet urges parents, learners and teachers to collaborate in trying to recover the lost time and fully commit to catch-up programmes.
12. Drought and fire
Cabinet reminds South Africans that the country is still experiencing drought. South Africa is one of the 30-driest countries in the world and the lower-than-normal rainfalls have worsened the situation. All people must continue partnering with government to conserve water so as to ensure there is sufficient supply for all.
13. Science and Technology
Cabinet notes astrological developments over the past weekend when astronomers working with the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona, USA, discovered a small asteroid (2018 LA) near the orbit of the Moon, which hours later made contact with Earth.
The resultant explosion which sent waves of low-frequency sound (infrasound) rippling through the atmosphere were detected by an infrasound monitor in South Africa, which was deployed as part of the International Monitoring System of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
B. Cabinet decisions
14. Cabinet approved for the submission of the 2016/17 report on the performance of the Research and Development (R&D) Tax-Incentive Programme to Parliament. The incentive programme has enabled companies to diversify their R&D portfolio, generate intellectual property and create new products. The incentive programme, which was introduced in November 2006, is being implemented by the Department of Science and Technology together with the South African Revenue Service and National Treasury.
From March 2016 to February 2017, a total of 153 R&D tax-incentive applications were received from 117 companies, 58 of which were first-time applicants. The applications were for 571 R&D projects worth an estimated
R3,6 billion. Cabinet is pleased with the growth in the number of companies that invest in R&D and continues to call on business to invest more in R&D, which remains an important pillar of our efforts to grow the economy.
16. Cabinet approved the reviewed Policy Framework for Accreditation of Diversion Services in South Africa. The policy framework was put in place in 2010 in line with the Child Justice Act, 2008 (Act 75 of 2008). The reviewing process seeks to ensure that diversion service providers and diversion programmes are at all times compliant with the minimum standards. Six of the chapters have been amended to improve the quality and standards of services provided to children found in conflict with the law.
17. Cabinet approved the Regional Engagement Strategy for Biosafety and its implementation. Biotechnology is recognised as an important potential driver of economic growth and a major tool in the fight against hunger and poverty, especially in developing countries.
This strategy will facilitate intra-African trade and improve the region’s competitiveness in global markets. It will improve South Africa’s collaboration and cooperation within the African region.
C. Bills
18. Cabinet approved the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill of 2018 to be published in the Government Gazette for public comment. The Bill seeks to establish the NHI Fund of South Africa, as a public entity, so as to provide for a sustained universal health access that is affordable and of high quality. It also sets out its functions, powers and duties.
The Bill provides a framework for the active purchasing of healthcare services by the fund on behalf of users and creates mechanisms for the equitable, effective and efficient use of the resources of the fund to meet the health needs of users. The Minister of Health will next week hold a full media briefing to unpack this Bill.
19. Cabinet approved for the introduction of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill of 2017 to Parliament. The Bill harmonizes the provisions which regulate the operations and governance of the public entities that report to the Minister of Science and Technology. This will ensure consistency in all requirements to be met and processes to be followed.
D. Upcoming events
20. Group of Seven (G7) Summit
Cabinet welcomes South Africa’s invitation to attend the upcoming G7 Summit in Canada. South Africa participated in the summit seven years ago and this invitation is an indication of renewed confidence in the South African economy.
Our government will seek to use the opportunity to invite investors to inject capital into our economy. Investment is necessary for economic growth and job creation on a scale that will significantly reduce current levels of unemployment.
21. South Africa-India 125 Years Anniversary Event
As part of the Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu centenary celebrations, Cabinet welcomes the commemoration on 7 June 2018 of Mahatma Gandhi’s removal from a train at Pietermaritzburg Station 125 years ago. This event spurred Gandhi’s philosophy of Satyagraha (truth-force), which had a significant influence on our political leadership and contributed to our liberation struggle.
22. Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic State Visit
President Cyril Ramaphosa hosted his Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic counterpart, Brahim Ghali, on 4 June 2018 during a State Visit to the country.
Cabinet expresses its solidarity with the people of Saharawi in their fight for independence and calls on the international community to provide the necessary support to the people of Saharawi.
E. Messages
23. Condolences
23.1. Cabinet joins President Ramaphosa in sending heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the five boys who died in a blaze at the Masiya informal settlement in Philippi, Cape Town.
The fire also displaced 30 residents of the informal settlement. Government is working hard to ensure that there is housing, security and comfort for all South Africans.
24. Congratulations
24.1. Cabinet wishes African National Congress veteran Baba Andrew Mokete Mlangeni a happy belated birthday. Baba Mlangeni celebrated his 93rd birthday on Wednesday, 6 June 2018. He was among the first to be sent for military training outside South Africa and after being arrested on his return, he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment on Robben Island.
24.3. Cabinet welcomes the appointment of Siya Kolisi as the first black captain of the Springbok team for the three match test series against England. We are confident that he will do South Africa proud as our captain, and will inspire others by his actions and leadership on and off the field of play.
24.4. Cabinet welcomes the appointment of Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene as Chairperson of the New Development Bank (NDB) Board of Governors. The NDB is a multilateral development bank established by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) in 2014.

3. Protests on highways
3.1. Cabinet strongly condemns the recent blocking of several highways by protestors in some parts of the country. Highways are a critical part of our transport infrastructure that supports the transportation of goods and services of the various sectors of the economy. Our constitutional democracy provides for platforms wherein people can raise their issues without causing any disruptions.
3.2. Criminal acts of aggression and disruptions will not be tolerated and Cabinet calls on law-enforcement officers to take the necessary steps, within the confines of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996, to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice.

11. Condolences
Cabinet expressed its deepest condolences to:
11.1. The family and friends of Honourable Sibusiso Radebe, an African National Congress Member of Parliament from Mpumalanga, who was killed during a hijacking attempt in Gauteng. Honourable Radebe will be remembered as a youth activist who worked hard to improve the lives of South Africans.
11.2. Family and friends of Ms Joyce Mashamba, who at the time of her passing was the MEC for Agriculture in Limpopo. The former freedom fighter served as an MEC in different provincial portfolios since the dawn of democracy.
11.4. The families of the three miners who died at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Kloof Ikamva Mine near Westonaria in Gauteng and calls on all stakeholders in the sector to continue to prioritise safety in our mines.
11.5. The Amampondo community on the passing of the Queen Mother of Amampondo aseNyandeni, Queen Fikelephi ‘Bongolethu’ Ndamase.
11.6. The families and friends of Mr Ismail Bassa and Mr Sayaad Hitig, who were killed during an attack on the Malmesbury mosque in the Western Cape.
12. Congratulations
Cabinet extends its congratulatory message to the following:
12.1. Dr Robert Gess, a leading South African researcher on Devonian marginal marine ecosystems and early vertebrates or ancient fish and early tetrapods. He uncovered what is believed to be a 360 million-year-old fossil. The two new species, named Tutusius and Umzantsia, are Africa’s earliest known four-legged vertebrates dating back a remarkable 70 million years. This discovery further cements our place as a world leader in science and research.
12.2. Bongumusa Mthembu for defending his Comrades Marathon title and Ann Ashworth for winning the women’s race. Cabinet also congratulates Xolani Luvuno for his determination and perseverance to finish the marathon using his crutches.
Enquiries:
Ms Phumla Williams – Acting Cabinet Spokesperson
Cell: 083 501 0139
Cabinet met on Wednesday, 4 July 2018, at the Union Buildings, Pretoria.
A. Issues in the environment
1. Mandela Month
The T-shirt is locally made, is available at leading retail stores and profits from the sale of the T-shirt will go to the Nelson Mandela Foundation to fund activities consistent with his vision and life. The Minister of Economic Development will address guests on behalf of Government. Cabinet urges all South Africans to support the buy local campaign and to wear locally-made clothing with pride.
2. Investment
Cabinet welcomes the recent primary listing of Old Mutual on the JSE. This listing by a company with a market capitalization of $10bn (R130bn), is a significant vote of confidence in South Africa and the local financial markets.
Cabinet appreciates that the primary listing in South Africa returns Old Mutual to its African roots and ends its period as a London-based financial services group. The commitment by Old Mutual to create a Fund of R500 million to promote local economic development, particularly by small, black-owned businesses, will boost the country’s efforts to build an inclusive economy. We call on other corporates in the financial sector to develop similar developmental funding instruments through dialogue with Government.
The recent World Economic Forum Roundtable on Investment served to showcase the potential of South Africa as a destination for increased and new investment. The Roundtable was attended by a large delegation of Chief Executive Officers of domestic and international firms, who interacted with President Ramaphosa and a delegation of Cabinet Ministers. The discussions were helpful in identifying measures to increase levels of investment and is a significant step towards the Investment Conference that will be convened by the President later this year.
3. Land expropriation
Cabinet appreciates the start of the Parliament’s public participation process to review Section 25 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 which will allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. Parliament set up the Constitutional Review Committee to conduct public hearings countrywide after passing a motion on the expropriation of land without compensation. These public hearings will take place in all the nine provinces until August 2018.
Cabinet calls on all interested parties to participate peacefully in these hearings and appeals to the public to remain tolerant of varying views that may be expressed, in order to ensure that all have a fair opportunity to participate in the hearings.
Cabinet also reflected on the concerns expressed by traditional leaders on land issues. As a result, it has appointed a team of Ministers to interact with the traditional leaders to discuss and seek an amicable solution to their areas of concern. The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Zweli Mkhize, is the convener and is supported by Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana, Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane and Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane.
4. Tax season
Cabinet encourages all taxpayers to submit their annual tax returns for the 2017/18 tax season, which opened for filing on 1 July 2018. Proper and efficient revenue collection ensures fiscal sovereignty, and timeous and accurate submissions ensure that taxpayers remain compliant. Tax revenue helps government to fund the country’s service-delivery projects and other socio-economic development programmes.
5. Petrol price increase
Cabinet has noted the recent fuel increases, which follows from another price increase in the past month. Another fuel price increase is anticipated next month. The Brent Crude Oil Dollar denominated price has been affecting the general prices of petrol, diesel and paraffin. Our currency’s exchange rate to the US dollar has fallen by more than one percent since the beginning of May this year.
These cyclical currency changes, which result in price fluctuations, have impacted negatively on the consumers, particularly the poor. The rise in petrol prices directly affects transport costs, food prices particularly the cost of staple food and medicine.
Cabinet assures South Africans that government is making an effort to alleviate the challenges faced by poor communities. National Treasury has appointed a nine-member panel of experts to review the current list of Value-Added Tax (VAT) zero-rated items currently consisting of 19 basic food items. President Cyril Ramaphosa is leading the team, comprising representative from both government and private sector, to draw in more investors into the country so as to grow our economy and create much-needed jobs, particularly for unemployed youth.
Cabinet appeals to the private sector to lend a hand, by delaying to transfer the impact of the fuel prices to the consumer. This will go a long way in cushioning the poor, who will be directly affected by these price fluctuations. Growing our economy will go a long way in stabilising our economy. Cabinet also appeals to the private sector to partner with government for the benefit of all affected South Africans, particularly the poor.
6. Payment of social grants
Cabinet was briefed by the Minister of Social Development, Susan Shabangu, on the recent widespread delays in scheduled social grant payments to beneficiaries. Cabinet appreciates that social grants are a lifeline to the most vulnerable members of our society and therefore such inconvenience is very much regrettable. It expressed its sincere apology to all affected beneficiaries.
Minister Shabangu has assured Cabinet that the technical glitches were a result of the transition of the payments from an old system to a new South African Social Security Agency/South African Post Office system. She has assured Cabinet that most, of the affected beneficiaries have since been paid. Meanwhile, dedicated teams are working hard to stabilise the systems to prevent a recurrence of such delays in the future.
7. Health Inquiry
Cabinet welcomes the release today of the interim report by the Competition Market Inquiry into the private healthcare industry. The Inquiry is chaired by the ex-Chief Justice, Sandile Ngcobo and has heard evidence from a number of stakeholders in the past three years. The provisional report will be open for public comments for a period of two months. The final report will be submitted to the Minister of Economic Development, by the end of 2018, and will be tabled in parliament.
8. Khartoum Declaration
Cabinet welcomes the agreement on a permanent ceasefire between South Sudan President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar, and the signing of the Khartoum Declaration. This raises hope of a deal to end their country’s devastating war.
The declaration stipulates that the ceasefire arrangement includes disengagement, separation of forces in close proximity, withdrawal of all allied troops, opening of humanitarian corridors and the release of prisoners of war and political detainees. The agreement also allows members of the African Union (AU) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development to deploy forces to supervise the ceasefire.
Cabinet encourages all parties to work together to ensure that the ceasefire finally leads to ending the war and ensure the return of peace and economic development in South Sudan.
9. African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFRA)
Cabinet welcomes South Africa’s signing of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement with the AU. The signing of this agreement by South Africa brings the number of countries who have signed to forty nine.
The AfCFTA takes the continent closer to the creation of the world’s biggest free trade area. It is expected to yield great socio-economic benefits for all countries in the continent.
According to the UN, it is estimated that the AfCFTA will boost intra Africa trade by 53% by eliminating import duties and non-tariff barriers. This agreement is potentially poised to create an African market of more than 1.2 billion people with an economy worth US$2.5 trillion.
The Minister of Trade and Industry will commence the process to get the Agreement ratified through Parliament.
10. African Agenda
Cabinet welcomes the 6th Southern African Customs Union (SACU) Summit held on 29 June 2018 in Botswana, which was attended by President Ramaphosa. The summit underscored the importance of the regional integration agenda that promotes economic integration, industrialisation and economic diversification of the SACU economies.
President Ramaphosa also led a delegation to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, for the 31st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of AU Heads of State and Government. The summit took place from 1 to 2 July 2018 under the theme: “Winning the Fight against Corruption: A Sustainable Path to Africa’s Transformation”. It presented a unique opportunity to reflect on and address specific challenges related to the fight against corruption in the continent.
B. Cabinet decisions
11. Cabinet approved the concept paper and plan for National Women’s Day and Month in August 2018. The theme for this year is “100 Years of Albertina Sisulu: Women United in Moving South Africa Forward”. This year’s programme coincides with the triple centenaries of the birth of Nelson Mandela, Albertina Sisulu and the formation of the Bantu Women’s League.
The Women’s Month activities will mobilise society and build partnerships to decisively address key issues facing women and girls, particularly gender-based violence, women’s economic empowerment, access to land, harmful practices and other sectoral issues in the context of the National Development Plan (NDP) and South Africa’s international commitments. The Minister in The Presidency responsible for Women, Bathabile Dlamini, will unpack the full programme at a later stage.
C. Bills
12. Cabinet approved the submission of the National Gambling Amendment Bill of 2018 to Parliament. The Bill has already gone through public consultation with all the relevant stakeholders.
The Bill makes intervention in the electronic gambling, advertising of gambling and location of the gambling premises. It also replaces the current National Gambling Board with the National Gambling Regulator (NGR). Working with the provincial authorities, the NGR will develop the standard operating criteria that will serve as a mini standard to guide self-regulating bodies such as in the horse-racing sector.
D. Upcoming Events
14. 100 Men March
Under the umbrella of the national “Send Me – Thuma Mina” campaign led by the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS), a historic “100 Years of Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu: Men’s March against Violence on Women and Children” will take place on Tuesday, 10 July 2018.
The march, which is being coordinated by the GCIS, will start at 10:00 from Church Square and end at the southern lawns of the Union Buildings in Pretoria.
Cabinet invites all men and boys to respond to the “Send Me – Thuma Mina” rallying call by participating in the march, and taking a stand against the scourge of violence against women and children. Men from diverse sectors, racial, political and religious backgrounds will be united in their stance to stop violence against women and children.
15. National Imbizo Focus Week
Government will embark on its National Imbizo Focus Week from 9 to 15 July 2018, where members of the Executive will engage directly with citizens across the country.
One of the cornerstones of democratic South Africa has been government’s steadfast commitment to embark on regular participatory and responsive public-engagement programmes to outline government policies and plans.
Cabinet encourages all communities in the spirit of “Thuma Mina” to participate in the izimbizo with government officials and use the opportunity to address service-delivery challenges.
16. 10th BRICS Summit
South Africa is ready to host, in the spirit of Ubuntu (Humanity), the 10th summit of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) bloc from 25 to 27 July 2018, at the Sandton Convention Centre in Gauteng. On Friday, 6 July 2018, President Ramaphosa is scheduled to engage with Team South Africa over breakfast on the readiness to host the 10th BRICS Summit.
The theme: “BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution”, reflects the core priorities of the BRICS members, notably to strive towards the creation of an inclusive society and global partnerships that will bring prosperity to all humankind. The theme also aligns and ensures strategic continuity with South Africa’s chairship of both the Southern African Development Community and the Indian Ocean Rim Association.
South Africa will use its chairship to ensure continuity for BRICS and bring specific focus to the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
17. Roundtable of African Ministers of Arts and Culture
18. MeerKAT telescope/Square Kilometer Array (SKA)
President Ramaphosa is expected to launch the 64-dish radio telescope, known as the MeerKAT, as a precursor to the SKA telescope. The MeerKAT is located 90 km outside the small town of Carnarvon in the Northern Cape.
The MeerKAT telescope will be instrumental in significantly increasing knowledge of how the Universe was formed, how it works and what may shape its future. The completion of the instrument is a significant milestone that should be celebrated by South Africa and Africa at large.

24. Cabinet commemorates with pride the 63rd anniversary of the historic adoption of the Freedom Charter which formed the basis of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.

Cabinet met on Wednesday, 22 August 2018 at Tuynhuys in Cape Town.
A. Issues in the environment
1. Economy
1.1. The recent economic developments in Turkey have led to a large depreciation of emerging market currencies, including the South African Rand.
1.2. Capital outflows from these markets have accelerated and bond yields have risen, slowing down economic growth and job creation. Turkey’s large foreign currency denominated liabilities and relatively low levels of foreign currency reserves predisposed the country to large and damaging capital outflows, as monetary policy started to normalise in advanced economies.
1.1. The recent economic developments in Turkey have led to a large depreciation of emerging market currencies, including the South African Rand.
1.3. Cabinet notes that South Africa has a number of strengths, including an independent central bank, an inflation-targeting regime with inflation consistently within the target range, low levels of foreign-currency debt and a clear fiscal consolidation plan. Cabinet is committed to maintaining these strengths.
2. Value-Added Tax (VAT)
1.5. Government will continue to collaborate with business, labour and civil society to restore confidence in the economy and address the structural constraints to economic growth. Working together we can translate our plans into concrete actions to move the South African economy forward.

3.3. Since the start of our democracy in 1994, great strides have been made to ensure that women enjoy the same rights as their male counterparts in education, employment, property, inheritance and justice. In driving an inclusive economy, we are working hard to ensure the full participation of women in the economy and driving an inclusive economy.
3.6. The Minister of Police, Mr Bheki Cele, has recommitted members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) to prioritise cases that involve the abuse of women and children. When a woman or a child reports a crime or abuse, it must be followed up with the urgency it deserves and taken to its full conclusion.

4.3 The two small-scale fishing communities who will be benefiting from this policy have received basic training on cooperatives and have been assisted to register cooperatives for the purpose of applying for 15-year fishing rights.
5. Tax season
5.1. Cabinet commends the close to three million taxpayers who have filed their tax returns, of which over half were submitted through eFiling.

Provisional taxpayers who opt to file their returns through eFiling have until 31 January 2019 to do so.

Cabinet calls on the public to use public transport and actively implement road safety initiatives throughout the year.

The intended outcomes are to have a competitive, viable and sustainable South African Post Office that provides/facilitates universal services and access as well as the transformation of the postal sector. The Bill also provides an approach to assigning physical addresses to rural and traditional communities.
This Bill has already gone through public consultation.
Additionally, the four investment envoys who were appointed by the President will report back to the conference on progress made.
President Ramaphosa has been invited by the Federal Chancellor of Germany, Dr Angela Merkel, to participate in the G20 Investment Summit – German Business and the Compact with Africa (CwA) Countries, and a Business Roundtable, both of which will be held in Berlin, Germany on 30 October 2018.

The G20 Conference on the CwA will focus on ways in which the G20, African countries and development institutions can cooperate to promote private investment and economic participation in African states. The meeting will also undertake preparatory work in this field for the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Cabinet met on Wednesday, 5 December 2018 at Tuynhuys in Cape Town
A. Issues in the environment
1. Economic growth
Cabinet also joins South Africans in welcoming this month’s drop in the fuel price which comes as a relief, especially as we move into a holiday period. All sectors of society are urged to build on the positive momentum during the third quarter to help place the South African economy on a new growth trajectory.
2. National Minimum Wage (NMW)
Cabinet also welcomes the signing of the NMW Bill into law by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The Bill sets a historic precedent in the protection of low-earning workers and reduction of inequality in society. The first NMW will raise the earnings of an estimated six million South African low-earning workers. There will be a phase-in period for farm workers, forestry workers and domestic workers. Whilst this NMW will not end income inequality, Cabinet believes it will go a long way to breaking the back of rising inequality and persistent poverty.
3. Toyota Wessels Institute for Manufacturing Studies (TWIMS)
Cabinet welcomes the launch of the newly established R56-million TWIMS. The institute will boost South Africa’s manufacturing sector, develop world-class capabilities and drive African industrialisation. It will also accelerate the building of a manufacturing culture that the country needs to drive its domestic demands and create more jobs.
It is an independent and not-for-profit initiative established through grant funding from the Toyota South Africa Education Trust. It has been established in partnership with the University of Pretoria’s Gordon Institute of Business Science to deliver a Master of Business Administration degree specialising in manufacturing.
4. Social Economy
Cabinet notes the successful Symposium on the Social Economy held by government in partnership with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Government of Flanders on Friday, 30 November 2018. The symposium was led by the Economic Development Department and supported by the Department of Small Business Development.
The Social Economy comprises enterprises and initiatives directed at achieving social-policy objectives such as creating jobs, mainstreaming excluded groups, and bringing goods and services to rural communities. It has the potential of supporting economic inclusion and creating thousands of additional jobs. The symposium brought together social entrepreneurs, policymakers, researchers and non-governmental organisations, and will help in the development of a Green Paper on the Social Economy during 2019.
5. Voter registration
In preparation for the 2019 elections, Cabinet calls on South Africans to exercise their right as responsible citizens by ensuring they have a green bar-coded ID book, smart ID card or temporary identity certificate and are registered to vote in their districts. The Independent Electoral Commission will hold a voter-registration weekend on 26 and 27 January 2019 and South Africans are encouraged to use the opportunity to register to vote or verify their registration status. Cabinet appeals to those who have applied for Smart IDs to collect their documents at their respective Department of Home Affairs (DHA) branches.
6. National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP)
7. Limpopo health professionals
Cabinet strongly condemns attacks on doctors in hospitals around Limpopo. Health professionals and health facilities serve communities, especially vulnerable members who facilities to get assistance. Attacking those who are meant to save lives is a criminal offence and will not be tolerated. The Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, is leading a multidisciplinary task team – comprising police intelligence agents, detective services, public order policing, private security authorities and DHA officials – to review the security systems at public healthcare facilities. Cabinet calls on the community to work with law-enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators of this heinous crimes are arrested and convicted.
8. Safer holidays
9. Fifth anniversary of the passing of Madiba
10. Global Citizen Festival Mandela 100
11. World AIDS Day
South Africa marked World AIDS Day on 1 December under the theme: “Cheka Impilo. Know Your Status.” Cabinet appreciates government’s multidimensional HIV and AIDS programme that has taken decisive steps to bring an end to the epidemic. The programme has realised an additional uptake of two million people to the antiretroviral treatment programme.
South Africa has more than 4,2 million people on treatment, making it one of the world’s biggest treatment programmes. The HIV and AIDS campaign continues to make inroads towards changing behaviour, medical treatment and social de-stigmatisation. Cabinet is steadfast in its call on South Africans to get tested so they can know their HIV status, which will help them make informed decisions on preventative measures, treatment, care and support.
12. UN International Day of Persons with Disabilities
South Africa joined the global community in observing the annual UN International Day of Persons with Disabilities on Monday, 3 December.
Government remains committed to the inclusion and protection of persons with disabilities through dedicated programmes and interventions to ensure access to equal opportunities, as enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996.
B. Cabinet decisions
13. Nkomazi Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
Cabinet ratified a decision of the Minister of Trade and Industry, Dr Rob Davies, to designate the SEZ and to grant a SEZ Licence to the Mpumalanga Provincial Government’s Department of Economic Development and Tourism.
The Nkomazi SEZ will be positioned as an “Agro-Processing Hub” using green energy. It will be supported by mixed services such as warehousing and logistics. This forms part of is the Maputo Development Corridor project, which is a major trade corridor which connects Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga with Maputo in Mozambique. It comprises, among other things, roads, ports and railways.
It will contribute towards accelerating growth, attract foreign and domestic direct investment, expand the manufacturing sector and create employment in the region.
16. Cabinet approved the submission of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Copyright Treaty (WCT) of 1996 to Parliament for accession. This is a multilateral agreement and a special agreement under the Berne Convention that deals with the protection of the work and rights of their authors in the digital environment. Acceding to the WCT also benefits the South African creative industry, specifically authors of literary and artistic works. The WCT is in the best interest of South Africa as it ensures that the country’s copyright law will keep pace with technological change. This will afford important protection against piracy for rights holders in the areas of computer programmes and databases.
17. Cabinet approved the submission of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996, to Parliament for accession. This is a multilateral agreement which deals with the rights of performers and producers of phonograms, specifically in the digital environment. This treaty will protect people or organisations that add substantial creative, technical or organisational skill in the process of bringing work to the public and enhance revenue to benefit them.
20. Cabinet approved for South Africa to sign the Convention to establish, under international law, an intergovernmental organisation called the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory, which will be responsible for the construction and operational phases of the global SKA radio telescope project, to be located in South Africa and Australia. The signing of the convention will be crucial in providing the global partnership with the appropriate governance mechanisms, which will ensure successful delivery of the project. South Africa will also be able to leverage foreign inward investment, as well as skills and infrastructure development benefits associated with the SKA project.
21. Cabinet approved the One-Stop Border Post (OSBP) National Framework for implementation. This provides guidance towards the speedy establishment of OSBPs between South Africa and its neighboring countries. The OSBP will enhance trade facilitation without compromising national security or revenue collection through the efficient movement of goods, persons and services between South Africa and the adjoining states of Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. It will also result in the region realising a faster border clearance and limited duplication of border agency interventions, which in turn improves trade competitiveness and movement of person by cutting down on cost and time.
22. Cabinet approved that the National Treasury and Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) will coordinate South Africa’s preparation for the national risk assessment and upcoming mutual evaluation process which commences in mid-April 2019. The mutual evaluation is a peer-review process conducted by international experts from other member countries of the intergovernmental body, the Financial Action Task Force, to assess the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering (AML) and combating of terrorist financing (CFT) system in South Africa. The outcomes of the process will assist in strengthening the integrity of the South African financial system by identifying steps to be taken to address any weaknesses in our AML/CFT system.
23. Cabinet approved the recommendations presented to the Department of Basic Education by the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation. The recommendations flow from the Impact evaluation of the Early Grade Reading Study after two years of interventions. The DBE initiated the Early Grade Reading Study in collaboration with various universities. This is a large-scale educational impact evaluation which aims to build evidence about what works to improve the teaching and learning of early grade reading in African languages in the country. The Report will be posted on the DPME website.
24. Cabinet approved the Policy Framework on National Museums. The aim is to transform the management and operations of museums in terms of access, redress, equity, nation-building and social cohesion. The policy proposes the clustering of museums into new management structures to achieve economies of scale by reducing the number of councils.It also provides for the grading of all the museums according to qualities, scope and significance to enable equitable funding allocations.
The Fourth Annual Meetings of the New Development Bank (NDB), during the first quarter of 2019. The NDB was established by the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) bloc to mobilise resources to support infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS countries, and other emerging markets and developing countries.The 17th Ordinary Session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) in June/July 2019. AMCEN is a permanent forum where African Ministers of the Environment deliberate and decide on environmental issues of relevance to the Continent. South Africa assumes its chairship from 2019 to 2021.C. Bills
30. Cabinet approved for the publication of the Conduct of Financial Institutions Bill of 2018 for public comment. This forms part of government’s reform of the financial sector regulation towards a Twin Peaks model and follows the enactment of the Financial Sector Regulation Act, 2017 (Act 9 of 2017) which, amongst others, aims to ensure better market conduct and the treatment of customers in the financial sector. Market conduct regulation aims to prevent and manage when prevention is not successful, the poor outcomes that arise from financial institutions conducting their business in ways that are unfair to customers or undermines the integrity of financial markets and confidence in the financial system.
This will allow the newly established Financial Sector Conduct Authority to better meet its mandate of protecting financial customers by ensuring fair treatment. The Bill, which will apply to all financial institutions, also supports transformation of the financial sector through implementation of the Financial Sector Code issued under the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, 2003 (Act 53 of 2003) by requiring that policies be introduced to comply with the code and also supervising implementation of those policies.
31. Cabinet approved for the introduction of the Financial Matters Amendment Bill of 2018 in Parliament.
The amendments relate to the:
D. Upcoming events
32. National Minimum Wage (NMW) announcement
President Ramaphosa will announce the NMW at an event to be held at Kliptown in Soweto on Friday, 7 December 2018. The NMW will immediately benefit more than six million workers and help address the level of inequality and poverty in South Africa. This landmark proclamation will extend our social net to the most vulnerable people.

Fellow South Africans,
It is a great honour to stand before you today to deliver the 25th annual State of the Nation Address in a free and democratic South Africa.
This year, as a diverse people and as a united nation, we will celebrate one of the greatest of human achievements.
We will celebrate the triumph of freedom over subjugation, the triumph of democracy over racial tyranny, the triumph of hope over despair.
We will celebrate the irresistible determination of an oppressed people to be free and equal and fulfilled.
We will use this time to recall the hardship and the suffering which generations of our people endured – their struggles, their sacrifices and their undying commitment to build a South Africa that belongs to all who live in it.
We will remember the relief and exhilaration of the day of our freedom, the moment at which we became a nation, a country at peace with itself and the world.
During the course of this year, we must and will reflect on the journey of the last 25 years.
As South Africans, we will have to ask ourselves whether we have realised the promise of our nation’s birth.
We must spend this year, the 25th anniversary of our freedom, asking ourselves whether we have built a society in which all South Africans equally and without exception enjoy their inalienable rights to life, dignity and liberty.
Have we built a society where the injustices of the past no longer define the lives of the present?
We must use this time to reflect on the progress we have made, the challenges we have encountered, the setbacks we have suffered, and the mistakes we have committed.
A year ago, we set out on a path of growth and renewal.
Emerging from a period of uncertainty and a loss of confidence and trust, we resolved to break with all that divides us, to embrace all that unites us.
We resolved to cure our country of the corrosive effects of corruption and to restore the integrity of our institutions.
We resolved to advance the values of our Constitution and to once again place at the centre of our national agenda the needs of the poor, unemployed, marginalised and dispossessed.
We agreed that, in honour of the centenary of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela and Albertina Nontsikelelo Sisulu, we would devote our every action, our every effort, our every utterance to the realisation of their vision of a democratic, just and equitable society.
In our magnificent diversity, and despite our many differences, the people of this country answered the call of Thuma Mina.
In their multitudes, South Africans asked not what can be done for them, but what they could do for their country.
Others expressed a willingness to support government in its efforts to turn the country around.
Today, as we reflect on the year that has passed, we can attest to meaningful progress.
Our people have embraced the renewal that our country is going through and are much more hopeful about a better tomorrow.
Over the last year, we have begun to rebuild a durable social compact for fundamental social and economic transformation with key stakeholders as we promised.
As social partners, we are restoring the bonds of trust, dialogue and cooperation.
We are reaching out to those parts of our society that have become disaffected, disinterested or marginalised through various forms of dialogue and engagement.
Our efforts may have been uneven, and we still have much work to do, but we have demonstrated over the last year our shared determination to work together to confront our common challenges.
We have focused our efforts on reigniting growth and creating jobs.
We have worked together – as government, labour, business, civil society and communities – to remove the constraints to inclusive growth and to pursue far greater levels of investment.
We held a successful Presidential Jobs Summit that agreed on far-reaching measures that – when fully implemented – will nearly double the number of jobs being created in our economy each year.
Last year, a number of stakeholders raised their concerns about policy uncertainty and inconsistency.
We have addressed these concerns.
In response to the dire situation at several of our state-owned enterprise – where mismanagement and corruption had severely undermined their effectiveness – we have taken decisive measures to improve governance, strengthen leadership and restore stability in strategic entities.
We have also had to deal with the effects of state capture on vital public institutions, including our law enforcement agencies, whose integrity and ability to fulfil their mandate had been eroded in recent years.
We have therefore acted to stabilise and restore the credibility of institutions like the National Prosecuting Authority, the South African Revenue Service, the State Security Agency and the South African Police Service.
We have appointed a new National Director of Public Prosecutions, Adv Shamila Batohi, to lead the revival of the NPA and to strengthen our fight against crime and corruption.
We are implementing the recommendations of the report of the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into SARS and are in the process of appointing a new Commissioner to head this essential institution.
On the basis of the report and recommendations of the High Level Review Panel on the State Security Agency, which was chaired by former Minister Sydney Mufamadi, I will soon be announcing a number of urgent steps to enable the reconstitution of a professional national intelligence capability for South Africa.
During the course of the past year as the Presidency, we have paid particular attention to the violence and abuse perpetrated against women and children in our society.
We responded to national concerns and calls by many South Africans by convening a Summit on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide that has provided a firm basis for a coordinated national response to this crisis.
We begin this new year encouraged by the progress we have made, working together, in reviving our economy and restoring our country’s democratic institutions.
We are determined to stay the course.
We are undaunted by the considerable difficulties we have yet to overcome.
All of us, as South Africans, should face up to the challenges and difficulties that lie ahead.
The task of building a better South Africa is our collective responsibility as a nation, as the people of South Africa.
It is at the centre of the work of every department of government, of every agency, of every public entity.
It informs every policy, every programme and every initiative.
While there is a broad range of critical work being done across government, this evening I want to address the five most urgent tasks at this moment in our history.
These are tasks that will underpin everything that we do this year.
Working together, we must undertake the following tasks:
Over the past year, we have focused our efforts on accelerating inclusive growth, significantly increasing levels of investment and putting in place measures to create more jobs.
Government responded with an economic stimulus and recovery plan that re-directed public funding to areas with the greatest potential for growth and job creation.
Our approach was not to spend our way out of our economic troubles, but to set the economy on a path of recovery.
We introduced a range of measures to ignite economic activity, restore investor confidence, support employment and address the urgent challenges that affect the lives of vulnerable members of our society.
We are pleased to report that significant progress has been made in restoring policy certainty on mining regulation and the visa regime, crafting the path towards mobile spectrum allocation, and reviewing port, rail and electricity prices.
We also began the process of stabilising and supporting 57 municipalities, where over 10,000 municipal infrastructure projects are being implemented.
The focus we have placed on revamping industrial parks in townships and rural areas has brought about discernible change, as industrial parks that have been lying idle are becoming productive again.
We have so far completed the revitalisation of 10 out of 16 identified industrial parks, in places such as Botshabelo, Phuthaditjhaba, Garankuwa, Isithebe, Komani and Seshego.
The levels of growth that we need to make significant gains in job creation will not be possible without massive new investment.
The inaugural South Africa Investment Conference in October last year provided great impetus to our drive to mobilise R1.2 trillion in investment over five years.
The Investment Conference attracted around R300 billion in investment pledges from South African and international companies.
There was also a significant increase in foreign direct investment last year.
In 2017, we recorded an inflow of foreign direct investment amounting to R17 billion.
Official data shows that just in the first three quarters of 2018, there was an inflow of R70 billion.
This is a phenomenal achievement compared to the low level of investment in the previous years.
Our investment envoys – Trevor Manuel, Mcebisi Jonas, Phumzile Langeni and Jacko Maree – as well as InvestSA are closely monitoring the status of the investments announced at the Investment Conference.
To prove that our investment conference was not just a talk shop where empty promises were made, as we speak, projects to the value of R187 billion are being implemented, and projects worth another R26 billion are in pre-implementation phase.
Drawing on the valuable lessons we’ve learnt, through a more focused effort, and through the improvements we’re making in the business environment, we aim to raise even more investment this year.
We will be identifying the sectors and firms we want and need in South Africa and actively attract investors.
It is our intention that the investment we generate should be spread out in projects throughout the country.
In this regard, I have asked provincial governments to identify investable projects and ensure that we build investment books for each of our nine provinces to present to potential investors.
Following our successful Investment Conference, a group of South African business leaders moved by the spirit of Thuma Mina initiated the Public-Private Growth Initiative to facilitate focused investment plans of leading companies across 19 sectors of the economy, from mining to renewable energy, from manufacturing to agriculture.
These industries expect to substantially expand investment over the next five years and create a vast number of new jobs, especially if we can enhance demand for local goods, further stabilise the labour environment and improve conditions for doing business.
As part of our ongoing work to remove constraints to greater investment, we have established a team from the Presidency, Invest SA, National Treasury and the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation that will address the policy, legal, regulatory and administrative barriers that frustrate investors.
This is an important aspect of our work to improve the ease of doing business in South Africa, which is essential to attracting investment.
This team will report progress to Cabinet on a monthly basis.
We have set ourselves the target of being among the top 50 global performers within the next 3 years.
It has long been recognised that one of the constraints that inhibit the growth of our economy is the high level of economic concentration.
The structure of our economy was designed to keep assets in a few hands.
This has stifled growth and enterprise and has to a large extent kept many young South African entrepreneurs and small enterprises out of the economy or confine them to the margins.
As part of our efforts to increase investment, and to foster greater inclusion and create more opportunities, I will soon sign into law the Competition Amendment Bill.
This will give the competition authorities the ability to address this problem but more importantly it will open up new opportunities for many South Africans to enter various sectors of the economy and compete on an equal footing.
To stimulate growth in the economy, to build more businesses and employ more people, we need to find new and larger markets for our goods and services.
We will therefore be focusing greater attention on expanding exports.
In line with Jobs Summit commitments, we will focus on the export of manufactured goods and trade in services such as business process outsourcing and the remote delivery of medical services.
We will also be looking at establishing special economic zones that are dedicated to producing specific types of products, such as clothing and textiles, for example.
To improve the competitiveness of our exports, we will complete the studies that have begun on reducing the costs of electricity, trade, communications, transport and other costs.
We will focus on raising the sophistication of our exports.
The agreement will see the creation of a market of over a billion people with a combined GDP of approximately $3.3 trillion.
Alongside a focus on exports, we will pursue measures to increase local demand through, among other things, increasing the proportion of local goods and services procured both by government and the private sector.
Increasing local demand, and reducing the consumption of imports, is important because it increases the opportunities for producers within South Africa to serve a growing market.
Through this we will intensify the “buy South Africa” programme.
Given the key role that small businesses play in stimulating economic activity and employment – and in advancing broad-based empowerment – we are focusing this year on significantly expanding our small business incubation programme.
The incubation programme provides budding entrepreneurs with physical space, infrastructure and shared services, access to specialised knowledge, market linkages, training in the use of new technologies and access to finance.
As part of the expansion of this programme, township digital hubs will be established, initially in four provinces, with more to follow.
We expect these hubs to provide most needed entrepreneurial service to small and medium enterprises in the rural areas and townships but more especially to young people who want to start their businesses.
Our greatest challenge is to create jobs for the unemployed of today, while preparing workers for the jobs of tomorrow.
These agreements, which are now being implemented by social partners, aim to create 275,000 additional direct jobs every year.
We have come up with great plans, platforms and initiatives through which we continue to draw young people in far greater numbers into productive economic activity through initiatives like the Employment Tax Incentive.
This incentive will be extended for another 10 years.
We call on all companies, both big and small, to participate in this initiative and thereby contribute not only to building their business but also to building the economy and fostering social cohesion.
Progress is being made in the areas of installation, repair and maintenance jobs, digital and tech jobs like coding and data analytics, as well as global business services.
These enable us to absorb more youth – especially those exiting schools and colleges, and those not in any education, training or employment – into productive economic activity and further work opportunities.
They should not face barriers and hindrances as they seek to find work.
We are focusing our attention, our policies and our programmes on the key parts of the economy that are labour intensive.
These include agriculture, tourism and the ocean economy.
The potential of agriculture in South Africa for job creation and economic growth still remains largely underdeveloped.
There are around 250,000 small emerging farmers who are working the land and need support in fully developing their businesses.
We intend to use it as a solid foundation to help develop agriculture in our country for the benefit of all.
Through an accelerated programme of land reform, we will work to expand our agricultural output and promote economic inclusion.
Our policy and legislative interventions will ensure that more land is made available for agriculture, industrial development and human settlements.
Alongside this constitutional review process we tasked the Deputy President to lead the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Land Reform to fast-track land reform.
An advisory panel of experts headed by Dr Vuyo Mahlathi, established to advise government on its land reform programme, is expected to table its report by the end of March 2019.
As part of accelerating land reform, we have identified land parcels owned by the state for redistribution.
As part of the stimulus package in agriculture, we have invested significantly in comprehensive farmer development support to ensure that restituted and communal land is productively utilised.
In the coming year, we will continue to focus on high value agricultural products with export potential such as our fruit, wine and vegetable industries, as well as poultry and red meat.
During SONA last year, we spoke at length about the huge potential that exists for the expansion of the tourism sector.
Our concerted efforts to market South Africa as a prime destination for tourists has yielded positive results, with significant annual growth in the number of foreign visitors.
We intend to raise this to 21 million by 2030, targeting, among others, the largest and fastest growing markets of India and China, as well as strong markets on our continent.
We will deepen the partnership between government and business to realise this vision.
This, combined with enhanced destination marketing and measures to strengthen tourism safety, will create the conditions for the growth we envisage, and the jobs and opportunities that will follow.
Our mere positioning as a country means we can harness the potential of our oceans to grow the economy.
Since the Operation Phakisa on the Oceans Economy in 2014, we have secured investments of nearly R30 billion and created over 7,000 direct jobs.
The investments have been mainly in infrastructure development, marine manufacturing, aquaculture, and the oil and gas sector.
Expected investment in the Oceans Economy over the next five years is estimated at R3.8 billion by government and R65 billion by the private sector.
These investments are expected to create over 100,000 direct jobs and more than 250,000 indirect jobs.
We are extremely encouraged by the report this morning about the Brulpadda block in the Outeniqua Basin, which some have described as a catalytic find.
This could well be a game-changer for our country and will have significant consequences for our country’s energy security and the development of this industry.
Government will continue to develop legislation for the sector so that it is properly regulated for the interests of all concerned.
Cabinet has adopted a new infrastructure implementation model to address these problems.
It will be underpinned by the new Infrastructure Fund announced in September last year.
Government has committed to contribute R100 billion into the Infrastructure Fund over a 10 year period and use this to leverage financing from the private sector and development finance institutions.
We plan to do things differently, starting with a deeper partnership with our communities in the planning, building and maintenance of infrastructure.
We will strengthen the technical capacity in government to ensure that projects move faster, building a pool of engineers, project managers, spatial planners and quantity surveyors – an action team that can make things happen faster on the ground.
The telecommunications sector represents vast potential for boosting economic growth.
As a water scarce country, we are confronting water crises in many parts of the country.
We are developing a comprehensive integrated nation plan that addresses water shortages, ageing infrastructure and poor project implementation.
We are urgently establishing an inter-governmental rapid response technical team, reinforced by specialist professionals, to intervene in areas which are experiencing severe water problems.
In one of these areas, Giyani, extensive work is underway to get water to the residents, in the immediate term through the repair of boreholes, and then through the rapid provision of proper infrastructure.
The safety of our learners in school is critical for creating a healthy, learning environment.
We recall with deep sadness the tragic deaths of Michael Komape, who drowned in a pit toilet at Mahlodumela Primary School in Limpopo in 2014, and Lumka Mkethwa, from Luna Junior Primary School in the Eastern Cape, who lost her life in March last year.
We conducted an audit last year and found that nearly 4,000 schools still have inappropriate sanitation facilities.
Given the scale and urgency of the problem, we launched the SAFE Initiative in August last year, through which we mobilised all available resources, including pledges from business, strategic partners, and the building industry to replace all unsafe toilets in public schools.
Since we launched the initiative, 699 schools have been provided with safe and appropriate sanitation facilities and projects in a further 1,150 schools are either in planning, design or construction stages.
This is an outstanding example of collaboration between government and business to address with urgency a great need that impacts on the right of South Africa’s children to safety and dignity in educational facilities.
We are making important progress in restoring the integrity and capacity of our strategic state owned enterprises.
To restore proper corporate governance, new boards with credible, appropriately experienced and ethical directors, have been appointed at Eskom, Denel, Transnet, SAFCOL, PRASA and SA Express.
We have established the Presidential SOE Council, which will provide political oversight and strategic management in order to reform, reposition and revitalise state owned enterprises, so they play their role as catalysts of economic growth and development.
We want our SOEs to be fully self-sufficient and be able to fulfil their development and economic role.
As we do all this, we will not support any measures that, in any form, dispose of assets of the state that are strategic to the wellbeing of the economy and the people.
We have the task and the responsibility to safeguard, build and sustain these key institutions for future generations.
We have sought credible plans from boards to put in place the right skills and expertise to manage these companies so that we can shift the focus from immediate stability to long-term sustainability.
We also seek to build a pragmatic and cooperative relationship between government, organised labour and private sector stakeholders, where we can jointly determine a strategic path for SOEs to create jobs, enable inclusive growth and become operationally and financially sustainable.
Security of energy supply is an absolute imperative.
Eskom is in crisis and the risks it poses to South Africa are great.
It could severely damage our economic and social development ambitions.
The consequences may be painful, but they will be even more devastating if we delay.
In responding to this crisis, we are informed by the need to minimise any adverse economic cost to the consumer and taxpayer.
As we address the challenges that face Eskom we will ensure that there is meaningful consultation and dialogue with all key stakeholders.
We will lead a process with labour, Eskom and other stakeholders to work out the details of a just transition, and proper, credible and sustainable plans that will address the needs of all those who may be affected.
As we address the challenges that face Eskom, we also need to safeguard our national fiscal framework, achieve a positive impact on our sovereign credit rating, and pay attention to the rights and obligations of Eskom’s funders.
We need to take steps to reduce municipal non-payment and confront the culture of non-payment that exists in some communities.
It is imperative that all those who use electricity – over and above the free basic electricity provided – should pay for it.
Government will support Eskom’s balance sheet, and the Minister of Finance will provide further details on this in the Budget Speech.
This we will do without burdening the fiscus with unmanageable debt.
To ensure the credibility of the turnaround plan and avoid a similar financial crisis in a few years’ time, Eskom will need to develop a new business model.
This business model needs to take into account the root causes of its current crisis and the profound international and local changes in the relative costs, and market penetration of energy resources, especially clean technologies.
It needs to take into account the role that Eskom itself should play in clean generation technologies.
To bring credibility to the turnaround and to position South Africa’s power sector for the future, we shall immediately embark on a process of establishing three separate entities – Generation, Transmission and Distribution – under Eskom Holdings.
This will also enable Eskom to be able to raise funding for its various operations much easily from funders and the market.
Of particular and immediate importance is the entity to manage an independent state-owned transmission grid combined with the systems operator and power planning, procurement and buying functions.
It is imperative that we undertake these measures without delay to stabilise Eskom’s finances, ensure security of electricity supply, and establish the basis for long-term sustainability.
At the centre of all our efforts to achieve higher and more equitable growth, to draw young people into employment and to prepare our country for the digital age, must be the prioritisation of education and the development of skills.
With over 700,000 children accessing early childhood education in the last financial year, we have established a firm foundation for a comprehensive ECD programme that is an integral part of the education system.
This year, we will migrate responsibility for ECD centres from Social Development to Basic Education, and proceed with the process towards two years of compulsory ECD for all children before they enter grade 1.
Another critical priority is to substantially improve reading comprehension in the first years of school.
This is essential in equipping children to succeed in education, in work and in life – and it is possibly the single most important factor in overcoming poverty, unemployment and inequality.
The department’s early grade reading studies have demonstrated the impact that a dedicated package of reading resources, expert reading coaches and lesson plans can have on reading outcomes.
We will be substantially expanding the availability of these early reading resources across the foundation phase of schooling.
Over the next six years, we will provide every school child in South Africa with digital workbooks and textbooks on a tablet device.
We will start with those schools that have been historically most disadvantaged and are located in the poorest communities, including multigrade, multiphase, farm and rural schools.
In line with our Framework for Skills for a Changing World, we are expanding the training of both educators and learners to respond to emerging technologies including the internet of things, robotics and artificial intelligence.
Several new technology subjects and specialisations will be introduced, including technical mathematics and technical sciences, maritime sciences, aviation studies, mining sciences, and aquaponics.
To expand participation in the technical streams, several ordinary public schools will be transformed into technical high schools.
Thanks to this initiative, links have been re-established with all institutions, and institution heads and student leaders have played a critical role in communicating with students.
The scheme is being phased in over a five year period until all undergraduate students who qualify in terms of the criteria can benefit.
Stabilising the business processes of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme will also be a priority in the coming year so that it is properly capacitated to carry out its critical role in supporting eligible students.
We are concerned about developments on some campuses this week, especially reports of violence and intimidation.
Of particular concern, is the tragic death of Mlungisi Madonsela, a student at the Durban University of Technology.
We extend our deepest condolences to his family and call on law enforcement agencies to thoroughly investigate the incident.
We call on student representatives and university authorities to work together to find solutions to the challenges that students are facing.
We will give effect to our commitment to build human settlements in well-located areas that bring together economic opportunities and all the services and amenities that people need.
The Housing Development Agency will construct an additional 500,000 housing units in the next five years, and an amount of R30 billion will be provided to municipalities and provinces to enable them to fulfil their respective mandates.
However, if we are to effectively address the substantial housing backlog in our country, we need to develop different models of financing for human settlements.
It is for this reason that we are establishing a Human Settlements Development Bank that will leverage both public and private sector financing to aid in housing delivery.
To date the majority of grant beneficiaries have been successfully migrated to the South African Post Office, and the old SASSA cards replaced by new ones.
We will now incorporate this consensus agreement into a policy framework to guide implementation.
This year, we will take a significant step towards universal access to quality health care for all South Africans.
After extensive consultation, the NHI Bill will soon be ready for submission to Parliament.
The NHI will enable South Africans to receive free services at the point of care in public and private quality-accredited health facilities.
By introducing the NHI together with a multi-pronged quality improvement programme for public health facilities, we are working towards a massive change in the health care experience of South Africans.
While we have made progress since 1994 in bringing down certain categories of serious crime, communities across the country are still plagued by gangsterism and violence.
The SAPS has embarked on a restructuring process to shift more policing resources to the local level.
Violence against women and children has reached epidemic proportions.
Every day, South African women are faced with discrimination, abuse, violence and even death, often by those they are closest to.
Over the last year, we have started to address this scourge in a more serious and coordinated way.
Work is underway to implement the decisions of the Summit, including preparing the National Strategic Plan on Gender- Based Violence.
This year, we will work with our partners in civil society to implement the decisions of the National Summit on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide.
We have been working to ensure the better functioning of Sexual Offences Courts.
We will strengthen the national hotline centre that supports women who experience gender-based violence and ensure it is functional.
We have listened to the call to make funds available to combat gender-based violence, and have allocated funding in the current budget to support the decisions taken at the Summit.
Government will lead the campaign to include men and boys as active champions in the struggle against gender-based violence.
Ending gender-based violence is an urgent national priority that requires the mobilisation of all South Africans and the involvement of all institutions.
South Africa has extremely high levels of substance abuse, which feeds crime and violence against women and children, it deepens poverty and causes great hardship and pain for families.
As government we continue to roll-out interventions to address social ills tearing our communities apart such as alcoholism and substance abuse.
We are resolute that all taverns, shebeens and liquour outlets near school premises must be shut down.
We recognise, as do all South Africans, that our greatest efforts to end poverty, unemployment and inequality will achieve little unless we tackle state capture and corruption in all its manifestations and in all areas of public life.
The action we take now to end corruption and hold those responsible to account will determine the pace and trajectory of the radical social and economic transformation we seek.
The revelations emerging from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state capture and other commissions are deeply disturbing, for they reveal a breadth and depth of criminal wrongdoing that challenges the very foundation of our democratic state.
We commend these commissions for the work they are doing, often under challenging circumstances, to uncover the truth.
These commissions need to be able to do their work without any hindrance, and we call on all those people who are in a position to assist them in their investigations to make themselves available.
While these Commissions will in time make findings and recommendations in line with their mandates, evidence of criminal activity that emerges must be evaluated by the criminal justice system.
Where there is a basis to prosecute, prosecutions must follow swiftly and stolen public funds must be recovered urgently.
To this end, we have agreed with the new National Director of Public Prosecutions, that there is an urgent need to establish in the office of the NDPP an investigating directorate dealing with serious corruption and associated offences, in accordance with section 7 of the NPA Act.
I will soon be promulgating a Proclamation that will set out the specific terms of reference of the Directorate.
It will identify priority cases to investigate and prosecute and will recover assets identified to be the proceeds of corruption.
Fellow South Africans,
As we grapple with the challenges of our recent past, and as we deepen our efforts to overcome the grave injustices of centuries, it is essential that we do so with our eyes firmly fixed on the future.
The world we now inhabit is changing at a pace and in a manner that is unprecedented in human history.
Revolutionary advances in technology are reshaping the way people work and live.
They are transforming the way people relate to each other, the way societies function and the way they are governed.
The devastating effects of global warming on our climate are already being felt, with extreme weather conditions damaging livelihoods, communities and economies.
As a young nation, only 25 years into our democracy, we are faced with a stark choice.
It is a choice between being overtaken by technological change or harnessing it to serve our developmental aspirations.
It is a choice between entrenching inequality or creating shared prosperity through innovation.
Unless we adapt, unless we understand the nature of the profound change that is reshaping our world, and unless we readily embrace the opportunities it presents, the promise of our nation’s birth will forever remain unfulfilled.
Today, we choose to be a nation that is reaching into the future.
In doing so, we are building on a platform of extraordinary scientific achievement.
The successful construction in the Northern Cape of the MeerKAT telescope, the world’s largest and most sensitive radio telescope, and the development of the Square Kilometre Array has enabled South Africa to develop capabilities in areas such as space observation, advanced engineering and supercomputing.
These skills and capabilities are being used to build HERA, a radio telescope designed to detect, for the first time, the distinctive radio signal from the very first stars and galaxies that formed early in the life of the universe.
This is not merely about advancing human understanding of the origins of the universe – it is about responding to the challenges that face South Africans now and into the future.
It is about developing the technology and the capabilities that will build a dynamic and competitive economy that creates decent, sustainable jobs.
It is about enhanced food security, better disease management, and cheaper, cleaner and more efficient energy.
It is about smarter, more responsive, more effective governance.
To ensure that we effectively and with greater urgency harness technological change in pursuit of inclusive growth and social development, I have appointed a Presidential Commission on the 4th Industrial Revolution.
Comprised of eminent persons drawn from different sectors of society, the Commission will serve as a national overarching advisory mechanism on digital transformation.
It will identify and recommend policies, strategies and plans that will position South Africa as a global competitive player within the digital revolution space.
Building on the work we have done over the last year, we will focus on further strengthening the capacity of the state.
We have made progress in examining the size and structure of the state, and will complete this work by the end of this administration.
In improving the capabilities of public servants, the National School of Government is introducing a suite of compulsory courses, covering areas like ethics and anti-corruption, senior management and supply chain management, and deployment of managers to the coal face to strengthen service delivery.
We will process the operationalisation of section 8 of the Public Administration and Management Act, which strengthens the outlawing of public servants doing business with the state and enable government to deal more effectively with corrupt activities.
The Ethics, Integrity and Disciplinary Technical Assistance Unit will be established to strengthen management of ethics and anti-corruption and ensure consequence management for breaches of government processes.
Fellow South Africans,
South Africa has this year taken up a non-permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council.
We will use this position to advance peace on the continent and across the globe, taking forward Nelson Mandela’s vision of a peaceful, stable and just world.
Fellow South Africans,
In a few months time, South Africans will go to the polls for the sixth time in our democracy to vote for national and provincial governments.
This is an opportunity for our people to exercise their hard-won right to determine the direction of this country.
I have engaged with the Independent Electoral Commission and also with the Premiers of all provinces, and intend to proclaim the 8th of May 2019 as the date of the election.
We wish to remind all eligible South Africans who have not yet registered as voters that they still have until the proclamation of the election date to register.
Fellow South Africans,
At times it has seemed that the milk of human kindness that allowed us to reconcile in 1994, had gone sour.
Our society is anchored in the roots of tolerance and co-existence, and we stand firm, resolute and united against all and everything that seeks to divide us or destroy our hard-won gains.
Yet we weathered the storm, and we are prevailing.
It is this optimism that will carry us forward as we face a brave new future.
It is a South Africa ready to take advantage of the technological changes sweeping the globe to make our economy grow and create jobs for our people.
It is a South Africa whose people have vision, drive and ambition; making it a hub of innovation, entrepreneurship and enterprise.
It is a South Africa that acknowledges the problems of the past, but looks firmly to the future.
It is a South Africa whose leaders are bold and courageous, leaders who remain servants of the people – and for whom fulfilling their duty is the highest, and the only, reward.
The task before us is formidable.
Above everything else, we must get our economy working again.
Because when we succeed – and of this we are certain – it is the entire nation that will benefit.
Let us grasp our collective future with both hands, in the immortal words of the Freedom Charter: side by side, sparing neither strength nor courage.
As we approach these tasks and challenges, we should heed the word of Theodore Roosevelt, who said:
“The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”
We all have a role to play as individual South Africans, faith-based organisations, sports organisations, trade unions, business, students, academics and citizens
I thank you.
Cabinet met on Wednesday, 13 February 2019 at Tuynhuys in Cape Town.
5.3. The discovery was made by the company after drilling at its Brulpadda prospects in the Outeniqua basin, about 175 kilometres (km) off the coast of South Africa.
7.2. Cabinet calls on all role-players to resolve issues in a peaceful manner. Our country needs educated young speople to contribute to our development.
7.3. Government, through the Department of Higher Education and Training, is assisting institutions of higher learning where there are challenges. Higher Education and Training Minister Naledi Pandor has also directed National Student Financial Aid Scheme administrators to prioritise providing responses to all student queries.
B. Cabinet decisions
12.2. The summit is convened under the banner of the 4IR South Africa (4IRSA), a partnership between the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Telkom, University of the Witwatersrand, University of Johannesburg and University of Fort Hare.
15.1.Cabinet has congratulated:
Mobile: 083 501 0139
Cabinet met on Wednesday, 27 February 2019 at Tuynhuys in Cape Town.
A. Issues In The Environment
1. 2019 Budget Speech
1.1. Cabinet welcomes the 2019 Budget Speech delivered by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni in Parliament, Cape Town on Wednesday, 20 February 2019, as a framework that has set South Africa on a path where together we are enabled to renew and rebuild our economy into an inclusive and thriving one.
1.3. Cabinet supports various initiatives, including cutting the public sector wage bill, in order to generate additional savings to strengthen government’s finances. Imposing strict conditions of financial support to Eskom to help the utility restructure into a viable organisation is also welcomed.
2. Eskom
2.2. The Special Cabinet Committee is convened by Deputy President Mabuza and includes the Ministers of Public Enterprises, Energy, Transport, Finance, Police and State Security. It will be required to monitor energy supply on a daily basis.
2.3. In line with President Ramaphosa’s commitment that government’s response to the electricity crisis must be inclusive and consultative, the Minister of Public Enterprises and the Eskom board Chairperson had their first preliminary engagements with the leadership of the three labour unions recognized by Eskom, the coal mining industry and the engineering fraternity.
2.4. The meeting with labour reported on the problems with Eskom’s operations and generation system, maintenance and unplanned outages. The meeting sought to establish a basis for formal future consultations. The restructuring of Eskom was also discussed, and all parties agreed that there would be more interactions to better understand the roadmap and the implications of separating Eskom’s business divisions into three separate operating entities.
2.5. The coal mining industry was convened under the auspices of the Minerals Council of South Africa (MINCOSA), and the meeting raised problems related to coal supply, costs and pricing, and the quality of coal provided to Eskom.
2.6. Further engagements were convened with the engineering fraternity, under the auspices of the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA). All engineering specialist disciplines were represented by their respective voluntary associations, including the National Association of Black Engineers.
2.7. The ECSA gave its analysis of the problems facing Eskom and provided a set of recommendations about how to involve the broader South African academic and technical professional fraternity in the urgent interventions required to stabilize electricity supply.
2.8. MINCOSA and the ECSA will assist government to establish a Technical Operations and Maintenance Review Team for Eskom that will be announced shortly.
3. Renewable energy
3.1. Cabinet supports the announcements by Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, which reaffirms the basic rationale behind renewable energy in arresting the high negative impact of fossil fuel sources of energy such as oil and coal.
3.4. The World Bank Group recently hosted the South African Renewable Energy and Energy Storage Systems in Cape Town from 25 to 26 February 2019 under the theme: “Batteries, Energy Storage and the Renewable Future – Towards a 100% Dispatchable Renewable Energy System”. Delegates from industry, finance, utilities, regulators, government and academia discussed advancements in the renewable-energy sector including policy, regulatory, financial, business, technological, applications, innovation, codes and standards issues that are required for the expansion of renewable energy.
3.5. Renewable energy and energy storage technologies enable us to convert electrical power into an energy form and store it for later use when needed. Energy storage systems reduce the need for back-up capacity from coal or gas-fired electrical generation plants, thereby reducing power sector emissions and help us mitigate against climate change.
4. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Programme
4.1. Cabinet welcomes local and international investor confidence displayed through investments in the Saldanha Bay Industrial Development Zone (SBIDZ), which is developing into a world-class offshore and martime hub. This is part of the Department of Trade and Industry’s SEZ Programme.
4.2. The establishment of SEZs countrywide is reversing the concentration of economic activity to certain areas of the country as a result of apartheid spatial planning.
4.3. Since their establishment, SEZs have contributed to attracting foreign direct investment such as the recently signed a R3-billion investment at the SBIDZ.
4.4. The SBIDZ’s investment pipeline includes at least five more investments that will add another R2.4 billion of investment to the short and medium-term outlook of the zone, once completed.
5. Water supply
6. School safety
6.2. Cabinet also commends the South African Police Service for their swift apprehension of suspects involved in an attempted hijacking at an Edenvale school in Gauteng.
6.3. Cabinet makes a special appeal to school governing bodies to assess the existing infrastructure of their schools to ensure that school buildings are safe, regularly maintained and conducive to learning.
7. Unacceptable practices by some religious leaders
7.2. People approach religious institutions to gain spiritual fulfilment and psychological strength, especially when they are at their lowest and most vulnerable state. Cabinet calls on all people to work together to stop these practices which abuse people’s vulnerability and endanger their lives. The law-enforcement agencies should intervene where acts of criminality have been committed under the guise of religion. Cabinet has also noted that the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities is investigating these practices, which will provide a more comprehensive intervention that will stop them.
8. 2019 national and provincial elections
8.1. Cabinet calls on all eligible South Africans, especially young first time voters who have registered in their thousands, to exercise their right to vote in the upcoming National and Provincial Elections on Wednesday, 8 May 2019, and have a say in the future of the country.
8.3. In South Africa, the right to vote is a culmination of years of struggle for our freedom. It came at a huge cost with countless of our country men and women sacrificing their lives.
9. Caster Semenya
9.1. Cabinet joins the rest of South Africa in standing united behind our golden girl Caster Semenya. Her case, which is being heard before the Court of Arbitration for Sport, is more than just a sporting matter. It is about fundamental human rights and the inherent dignity of all people.
9.2. We call on people to show their support at #HandsOffCaster. Let us show the world that we are a nation which values fairness, equality and respect for human dignity.
10. Creative industry
10.2. Participants agreed that government should engage stakeholders and Parliament on the Copyright Amendment Bill, development of the Media Transformation Charter, engage broadcasters in an endeavour to curb exploitation of small and independent producers, and ensure that content owners duly benefit from their content being used on online platforms.
11. Fake social media accounts
11.1. Cabinet notes with concern fake LinkedIn and Facebook accounts which claim to be that of Ministers and Deputy Ministers.
11.3. Members of the public are urged to exercise caution and those who fell prey to these impersonators should immediately report it to the police.
11.4. Cabinet condemns activities performed in the name of members of the Executive or any other member of society through fake social media accounts.
11.5. We distance ourselves from the comments, views and photographs purported by these fake accounts.
12. Venezuela
12.1. Cabinet is concerned about the unfolding situation in Venezuela, especially the humanitarian challenges that require urgent attention. We commend efforts by the United Nations (UN) to provide humanitarian support to locals and call on the the international community to support the people of Venezuela during this difficult time.
B. Cabinet Decisions
13. National Action Plan (NAP) to Combat Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance
13.2. This follows extensive consultations with government departments, Chapter Nine institutions, civil-society organisations and relevant stakeholders in all provinces.
14. Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
14.1. Cabinet approved submission of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to Parliament for ratification in terms of Section 231(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996.
14.2. Ratification promotes constitutionalism, human rights and is in accordance with South Africa’s international obligations. The Constitution provides for the prevention of the violation of the rights of person held in places of detention through state sanction or court order.
15. Designs of the commemorative collectors coin series
15.1. Cabinet approved the designs of the commemorative collectors’ coin series to be issued in 2019-2021:
a) 2019 ‘Celebrating South Africa’ coin series: 25 Years of a Constitutional Democracy;
b) 2019-2021 pure-gold coin series: Africa’s Big Five;
c) 2019-2021 platinum coin series: Africa’s Big Five;
d) 2020 Natura coin series: the Supercontinent Gondwana;
e) 2020 Natura coin series: R25 fine-silver coin: Cradle of Humankind – Hominids;
f) 2020 2½c tickey and R2 crown series: South African Inventions – Retinal Cryoprobe;
g) 2020 R10 and R5 colour coin series: Birds and Flowers of the Cape Winelands Biosphere Reserve; and
h) 2021 Natura coin series: R25 fine-silver coin: the Supercontinent Gondwana.

1.2. Cabinet also welcomes Chinese electronics manufacturer Hisense’s R72-million investment into its refrigeration and television production lines at its Atlantis factory in the Western Cape, which created 150 manufacturing job opportunities. This investment brings Hisense’s total investment in this Atlantis plant to R440 million.
2.2. Cabinet welcomed the post-settlement support provided by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform through a variety of tractors to be used by farmers in the area, which will ensure the keeping and working of the land for current and future generations.
3.1 Cabinet welcomes the release this week of the latest employment data from StatsSA, which confirm the growth in total employment during 2018. The Quarterly Employment Survey (QES), one of two surveys conducted by StatsSA, showed that employment in the formal sector grew by 158 000 during the 12 months of 2018. During the last three months of last year, employment grew by 87 000. The survey excludes data on agriculture and the informal economy.
3.2 This welcome trend follows the release last month of the more comprehensive Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS), which covers all sectors of the economy, both formal and informal, and which also showed significant employment growth during 2018.
3.3 This increase in jobs reflect in part growing investor confidence and a rise in foreign direct investment in the economy, pointing to the success of the President’s efforts to boost South Africa as a destination for investment. The Presidential Investment Conference held in October last year attracted pledges of R300 billion. Over the next four years, Government will work with investors, local communities and organized labour to enable the pledged investment to take place and to help create additional jobs and economic opportunities.

These include switching off geysers, swimming pool pumps and lights that are not in use. Further progress on Eskom and electricity generation, as indicated by the Minister of Public Enterprises, will be provided within the next week.

The revised master plan will now be referred to as Anti-Drug Master Plan.

Honourable Members of the National Council of Provinces,
Fellow South Africans,
We gather here at the start of the 6th Democratic Parliament, 106 years to the day after the Natives Land Act – one of the most devastating acts of dispossession, pain and humiliation – came into force.
We recall the words of Sol Plaatje on that tragic event, when he said:
“Awakening on Friday morning, June 20, 1913, the South African native found himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth.”
Our people suffered gravely and endured untold hardships as a result of the implementation of the Natives Land Act. The effect of that law are still present with us.
More than a century after that grave injustice, we are called upon to forge a South Africa where no person will be slave or pariah, only free and equal and respected.
We gather here at an extremely difficult and challenging time in the life of our young democracy.
Yet, we are also at a moment in our history that holds great hope and promise.
In 25 years of democracy we have made remarkable progress in building a new nation in which all South Africans have equal rights and broadening opportunities.
Over 25 years, we have done much to meet people’s basic needs, to reduce poverty and to transform a devastated economy that was built to serve the interests of the few.
in which all may know peace and comfort and contentment.
Yet, we also meet at a time when our country is confronted by severe challenges.
Our economy is not growing. Not enough jobs are being created.
This is the concern that rises above all others.
It affects you, the young man eMzimhlope, out of school five years now and still not employed.
It impacts you, the single mother from Delft, whose grant supports not just yourself but your grandchildren too.
It hurts you, the worker in Nelson Mandela Bay, who despite earning a salary is struggling to make ends meet.
It is hard for you, the young student from the Sol Plaatje University, who must rely on a thin stipend from your parents to feed yourself.
It is hard for you, the young student from the Sol Plaatje University, who must rely on a thin stipend from your parents to feed yourself.
Yours are the lived struggles of the people of this nation.
We have heard you, and many others.
Through the elections held in May, you provided all of us with a clear mandate for growth and renewal.
We have heard you, and many others.
All of us have heard you – myself, Hon Maimane, Hon Malema, Hon Buthelezi, Hon Groenewald, Hon Meshoe, Hon Holomisa, Hon Zungula, Hon De Lille, Hon Magwaza-Msibi, Hon Galo, Hon Lekota, Hon Nyhontso and Hon Hendricks.

At the same time, we are having to contend with rapid technological change that is ushering in a new world of work, that is reshaping the global economy and that is redefining social relations.
Together with all the nations of the world, we are confronted by the most devastating changes in global climate in human history.
The extreme weather conditions associated with the warming of the atmosphere threaten our economy, they threaten the lives and the livelihoods of our people, and – unless we act now – will threaten our very existence.
We have heard the voices of the young people who marched to the Union Buildings last week urging us to take action to protect our planet.
However, with 10 years to go before we reach the year 2030, we have not made nearly enough progress in meeting the NDP targets.
Unless we take extraordinary measures, we will not realise Vision 2030.
This means that we need to prioritise.
We need to focus on those actions that will have the greatest impact, actions that will catalyse faster movement forward, both in the immediate term and over the next 10 years.
It is worth noting that the Medium-Term Strategic Framework for the last five years had more than 1,100 indicators by which we were to measure progress in the implementation of the NDP.
Now is the time to focus on implementation.
It is time to make choices.
Some of these choices may be difficult and some may not please everyone.
In an economy that is not growing, at a time when public finances are limited, we will not be able to do everything at one time.
As we enter this new administration, we will focus on seven priorities:
- Consolidating the social wage through reliable and quality basic services
In an economy that is not growing, at a time when public finances are limited, we will not be able to do everything at one time.
In an economy that is not growing, at a time when public finances are limited, we will not be able to do everything at one time.
At the same time, we must restore the National Development Plan to its place at the centre of our national effort, to make it alive, to make it part of the lived experience of the South African people.
At the inauguration, we said that this is a defining moment for our young nation.
At the same time, we must restore the National Development Plan to its place at the centre of our national effort, to make it alive, to make it part of the lived experience of the South African people.
As South Africa enters the next 25 years of democracy, and in pursuit of the objectives of the NDP, let us proclaim a bold and ambitious goal, a unifying purpose, to which we dedicate all our resources and energies.

We are far advanced in revising the NHI detailed plan of implementation, including accelerating quality of care initiatives in public facilities, building human resource capacity, establishment of the NHI Fund structure, and costing the administration of the NHI Fund.

To address the problems of the working poor, the national minimum wage has been in place for six months and the early indications are that many companies are complying.
If we are to successfully address the challenge of poverty across society, we need to provide skills and create economic opportunities for persons with disabilities.
We make this assertion at a time when the economic outlook is extremely weak.
Following the sharp contraction in growth in the first quarter, the Reserve Bank now projects that growth in 2019 is likely to be lower than anticipated in the February Budget.
One reason for the lacklustre economic performance has been the load shedding early this year, together with the continued uncertainty in the supply of electricity and the state of Eskom.
To address the problems of the working poor, the national minimum wage has been in place for six months and the early indications are that many companies are complying.
We make this assertion at a time when the economic outlook is extremely weak.
Since the load shedding earlier this year, Eskom has made much progress in implementing its nine-point plan, ensuring better maintenance of its generation fleet, reducing costs and ensuring adequate reserves of coal.
In line with the recommendations of both the Eskom Sustainability Task Team and the Technical Review Team, Eskom is deploying its most skilled and experienced personnel to where they are needed most.
In line with the recommendations of both the Eskom Sustainability Task Team and the Technical Review Team, Eskom is deploying its most skilled and experienced personnel to where they are needed most.
The lesson is clear: for growth, we need a reliable and sustainable supply of electricity.
For Eskom to default on its loans will cause a cross-default on its remaining debt and would have a huge impact on the already constrained fiscus.
One reason for the lacklustre economic performance has been the load shedding early this year, together with the continued uncertainty in the supply of electricity and the state of Eskom.
This we must do because Eskom is to vital to our economy to be allowed to fail.

We will soon also be appointing a Chief Restructuring Officer, who will be expected to reposition Eskom financially with careful attention to the mix between revenue, debt and cost structure of the company.
Eskom is working with government and other stakeholders to address its overall debt as well the debt owed by municipalities and individual users.

It requires the state to effectively play its role as an enabler that provides basic services and critical infrastructure, a regulator that sets rules that create equitable opportunities for all players, and a redistributor that ensures that the most vulnerable in society are protected and given a chance to live up to their full potential.

As a country, we must assert the principle that those who use electricity must pay for it.
We are going to substantially expand the agriculture and agro-processing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports.
We will bolster the mining industry by developing markets for South African minerals through targeted beneficiation, reduced costs of inputs, and increased research and development.

We are determined to ensure that tourists who come to our country are safe.
We will make good on our ambition to more than double international tourist arrivals to 21 million by 2030.
This will be achieved through the renewal of the country’s brand, introducing a world-class visa regime and a significant focus on Chinese and Indian markets and air arrivals from the rest of our continent.

Fellow South Africans,
We have to support the fire of entrepreneurship, because the fortunes of this country depend on the energies and creative talent of our young people.
If we are to ensure that within the next decade, every 10 year old will be able to read for meaning, we will need to mobilise the entire nation behind a massive reading campaign.
All foundation and intermediate phase teachers are to be trained to teach reading in English and the African languages, and we are training and deploying a cohort of experienced coaches to provide high quality on-site support to teachers.
All other interventions – from the work being done to improve the quality of basic education to the provision of free higher education for the poor, from our investment in TVET colleges to the expansion of workplace learning – will not produce the results we need unless we first ensure that children can read.
This forms part of the broader efforts to strengthen the basic education system by empowering school leadership teams, improving the capabilities of teachers and ensuring a more consistent measurement of progress for grades 3, 6 and 9.
Early reading is the basic foundation that determines a child’s educational progress, through school, through higher education and into the work place.

I dream of a South Africa where the first entirely new city built in the democratic era rises, with skyscrapers, schools, universities, hospitals and factories.
This is a dream we can all share and participate in building.
We have not built a new city in 25 years of democracy.
This is a dream we can all share and participate in building.
This dream has been fueled by my conversations with four people: Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Dr Naledi Pandor, Ms Jessie Duarte and President Xi Jinping, whose account of how China is building a new Beijing has helped to consolidate my dream.

The cities of Johannesburg, Tshwane, Cape Town and Ethekwini are running out of space to accommodate all those who throng to the cities.
You may ask how I can be hopeful at such a difficult time.
Will you be at the harvest,
As we enter this new era, let us take to heart the words of Ben Okri, when he says:
I am hopeful because I have walked with the people of this country – the nurses and health care workers, our men and women in uniform, the teachers in our schools, the students who despite their family’s hardship are determined to succeed, and the youth who are trying to start their own businesses, to invent and create, and to rise above their circumstances.
Then you must begin today to remake
And join the warriors and celebrants
Then you must begin today to remake
You can’t remake the world
Then you must begin today to remake
Each new era begins within.
Without remaking yourself.
Each new era begins within.
You can’t remake the world
For inner liberation.
We could use it to turn on
With unsuspected possibilities
We could use it to use even the dark
Our inward lights.
To clean our eyes,
To clean our eyes,
We could use the new era
Our inward lights.
To clean our eyes,
Help fulfill the golden prophecies.
To see ourselves more clearly.
Help fulfill the golden prophecies.
I thank you.

Cabinet met on Wednesday, 26 June 2019 at Tuynhuys in Cape Town.
In addition to that, one of the agreements signed was an investment agreement that covers the Beijing Auto Industrial Cooperation’s investment in the auto-manufacturing plant in the industrial development zone of Coega. It is an investment to build vehicles in South Africa for the South African market but also for markets elsewhere. These deals are part of commitments which came out of the existing comprehensive strategic partnership agreement of 2010, and the eight major commitments made at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.

Edition 13 Share books and stories!
Reading helps to open your children’s eyes, hearts and minds to other people and to different situations.
And, when they enjoy the stories you share with them, they are likely to want to continue reading for pleasure throughout their lives.
matshelong a bone otlhe.
Share books and stories with your children to help build a strong and loving bond with them while also helping to develop the literacy skills that are so important for their success at school and beyond.
Here are ten tips for reading to your children, no matter what their age.
Invite – but don’t force – your children to read with you for at least 15 minutes every day.
Find somewhere quiet and comfortable to read.
Beds and couches make good indoor reading places.
Turn off the radio, TV and computer.
Ask your children to choose a book for you to read together.
This shows that you care about what they think, and they are more likely to engage with a book that they have chosen themselves!
Start by spending some time looking at and talking about the book’s front cover.
Don’t forget to read the story’s title and the names of the author and illustrator.
Sit close together and encourage your children to hold the book themselves or to help you do this.
Younger children enjoy turning the pages.
Invite older readers to read the words of one of the characters or a paragraph or two of the story.
Try different things to make stories come alive!
Use different voices for different characters.
Read softly in quiet, gentle parts of a story.
Read quickly if a character is in a hurry, or is being chased.
Read in a big, booming voice for loud noises in the story.
Help your children develop their prediction skills by asking, “What do you think is going to happen next?” at different points in the story.
Talk about the story together.
Encourage your children to share their opinions of the ways in which the characters in the story behave and the choices they make.
If the book has illustrations, look closely at them together.
Comment on things you are curious about or that you notice and like.
Encourage your children to do the same.
But, most of all, simply enjoy sharing different books together.
Relax and do whatever it takes to make these times fun for all of you.

In August and September 2017, Nal’ibali ran a competition for the reading clubs that are part of its Story Powered Schools project in KwaZuluNatal.
This interschools competition aimed to help encourage a culture of reading for enjoyment in the province’s rural primary schools that participated in the Story Powered Schools project in 2017.
Story Powered Schools kwa porofenseng ya KwaZulu-Natal.
“A well-established culture of reading can be a real game-changer for education in South Africa.
We have been working with hundreds of schools to introduce them to the power and magic of reading in home languages.
The competition is a way for the clubs at these schools to connect and inspire each other,” explained Michael Cekiso, Programme Manager for the Story Powered Schools project.
Michael Cekiso, Motsamaisi wa Lenaneo la porojeke ya Story Powered Schools.
The reading clubs were judged on their dedication to reading, writing and storytelling over the year.
They gave performances to demonstrate the typical activities at their clubs.
In addition, they had to put together displays of their creative work, such as examples of the children’s writing and drawings, as well as their favourite isiZulu and English storybooks.
The first round of the competition saw the twelve clubs in each district competing against each other.
“The level of competition was unexpectedly high.
The children’s confidence and the passion of their teachers showed a lot of what was happening back at the schools.
This is remarkable and certainly not what we were expecting!” said one of the judges, Nontobeko Dlamini, a development practitioner and member of the Uthukela District Municipality.
There was another round of competition before the winners were announced: Elangeni Reading Club from Mthini Primary School in Ugu, and Siyafunda Reading Club from Nkanyezi Primary School in Uthukela!
The performances and displays of these two clubs showed that for the children who attend and the adults who guide them, the club is more than an after-school activity – it has become a way of life.
“Our reading club is a fun, free space where we do all our activities in a way we are comfortable with.
We won because we love what we do in our club!” said ten-year-old Alondwe Magudulela from Siyafunda Reading Club.
Commenting on Elangeni Reading Club’s success, its leader, Mrs Bongiwe Xaba, said, “We did not expect to win!
When we saw the displays of the other clubs, we were blown away.
But our club has heart.
I think the judges saw the children’s enjoyment and pride in being part of the club.” fenya!

Choose the ideas that best suit your children’s ages and interests.
ditshwantsho tsa sega-o-boloke, Ditsala tse tharo le thekisi (ditsebe Three friends and a taxi Ditsala tse tharo le thekisi This is a tale told all across Africa, from Nigeria to the Comoros to South Africa.
Sheep, Goat and Dog take a taxi to the sea and when they get there they have to pay the taxi driver for the journey.
How much will each of them pay?
They each have to face the consequence of the choice they make.
As you read the story together, enjoy looking at the pictures and talking about the details in them.
After you have finished reading the story, discuss the following questions with older children.
What do you think Sheep, Goat and Dog learnt from the taxi fares that they chose to pay?
Would you have paid exactly the right fare, more than what the fare was, or less than what the fare was?
Why would you have made this choice?
What if the taxi driver was asking for a fare that you thought was too high?
Would you still have made the same choice?
Why or why not?
gore Nku, Podi le Ntša ba ithutile eng go tswa mo mading a thekisi a itlhophetseng go a duela?
Ask your children to draw a picture of themselves in a taxi with two friends, and then to label their drawing with the title of the story.
Foxy Joxy plays a trick In this story, a sly fox sells watermelons, but everyone thinks he charges too much for them.
Foxy Joxy comes up with an idea to solve this problem, but the other animals are not happy with his decision, so they teach him a lesson.
As you read the book, discuss with your children the choices that the animals make.
Encourage them to suggest reasons for their opinions.
Page 4: Do you think that Foxy Joxy might have been charging too much for the watermelons?
Do you think it is fair to charge too much for something?
Page 8: Do you think that Foxy Joxy’s idea was a clever one?
Do you think his idea was fair?
Page 11: Do you think the other animals got what they paid for?
Pages 13 and 14: Do you think the other animals’ idea was a clever one?
What else do you think they could have done to teach Foxy Joxy not to cheat?
After you have read the book together, invite your children to write to Foxy Joxy.
They should explain to him why he should behave better towards the other animals and also give him some ideas for doing so.
Suggest that your children draw pictures of the animals playing football with the watermelon when Foxy Joxy was stuffed inside it.
Encourage them to add the text from that part of the story to their pictures.
The dog walker Aunty Vanessa is paid by other people to walk their dogs.
One day she and her nephew take five dogs to the park … and the trouble starts on their way there!
After you have read the story with your children, talk about which dog from the story you each like most, and why.
Also discuss how you think the story would have been different if they hadn’t found Princess’s collar.
Give your children cardboard or paper, glue, tinfoil and crayons and suggest that they make Princess’s collar and/or a collar for their favourite dog from the story.

Celebrate World Book Day!
a dream that your hands.
World Book Day is a worldwide celebration of books and reading.
It is observed in over 100 countries on different dates in the year and in different ways.
In South Africa, we celebrate it on 23 April each year.
Here are some ideas for how to celebrate World Book Day.
Talk to primary- or high school-aged children about how having books in your life makes a difference.
Then ask them to draw a picture, create a poster or a song or dance, or write a poem or rap to share their ideas with others.
Remember to find an opportunity to display the children’s pictures or posters, or to let them perform their songs, dances, poems or raps!
Nursery rhymes and songs are a great way to get very young children involved in World Book Day.
Find books that have traditional rhymes and songs for babies and children in your home language and share them with your children – and don’t forget to also share the ones you were taught as a child!
Provide some paper, pencil crayons and pens, and get older children to create their own picture books.
Then set up a time for them to read their books to a group of younger children.
Encourage your children to copy out a sentence or paragraph from their favourite book and then draw a picture to go with it.
Remind them to write the name of the book and the author too.
Display your children’s creations on the fridge, or on a wall in your home, classroom, library or at your reading club.
Reading club tip Make your World Book Day celebrations a success by: have to celebrate after  meeting with the volunteers at your who will be responsible for what.
and which books and stories you’ll focus  telling the children what they can expect on the day.
 inviting the childr en’s parents and caregivers to join in the celebrations at At the top of a large sheet of paper, write: Books I think you would enjoy.
Under it create columns like this: Books I think you would enjoy Book title Display the sheet of paper in your home, reading club, classroom, school or library, and encourage everyone to write up the names of books they have enjoyed reading.
If you leave it up for long enough, you might have to add another sheet!

Yuck!
Lucky made a friend and they spent the rest of the afternoon running after each other and sniffing each other.
But Princess refused to join in the fun.
Her ears drooped and she lay down under a tree.
I knew she was sad because she’d lost her My aunty is a dog walker!
I know that might sound strange, but that’s what she does for a living!
She walks other people’s dogs!
Sometimes, when I finish school early, Mamma lets me help Aunty Vanessa.
There are five dogs that she walks every afternoon.
Princess, the French poodle, is white.
She is very big and walks with her nose stuck up in the air, and she has a diamond collar.
Her owner, Ziyanda, is the poshest lady I know.
Pepper is a small, black, grumpy dog.
He bites my heels sometimes if I don’t watch out.
Lucky is a rescue dog and is full of tricks.
His owner got him from an animal shelter.
Nobody knows for sure what kind of dog he is, but he is friendly and he’s the one I like the most.
Dash and Lady are brother and sister.
They are quite big dogs with light brown coats.
They are a real handful because they love chasing balls – and squirrels.
At five o’clock, it was time to go.
We dropped the dogs off at their homes one by one – first Pepper, who tried to bite me as we opened his gate, then naughty Dash and Lady.
Aunty Vanessa wasn’t sad to drop them off.
We only had Lucky and Princess left.
Aunty Vanessa was dreading telling Ziyanda that we had lost the Just then Lucky started barking and refused to walk any further.
He jumped up and down at a lamp post.
Aunty Vanessa was cross with him.
“Stop that, Lucky!” she shouted.
Sometimes when Aunty Vanessa and I walk down the street with all five dogs, people stop and stare at us.
“You have quite a few dogs!” some of them say.
I looked up.
Something was fastened to the lamp post and it was glittering.
“Princess’s collar!” I shouted pointing at it.
“Somebody must have found it and hung it up there.” Hurriedly, I took it down and put it back around Princess’s neck.
I just smile and say, “Don’t worry – they’re not ours!” By the time we opened Princess’s gate, the poodle was looking much smarter and happier than before.
Aunty Vanessa told Ziyanda the story of how we had found the missing collar.
“Oh, that thing!” laughed Ziyanda.
“Those aren’t real diamonds!
They’re just shiny plastic stones!” she said.
One day I was helping Aunty Vanessa.
I was holding the leads for Princess and Lucky.
Aunty Vanessa was having a hard time keeping Dash and Lady under control while avoiding Pepper’s nips.
On our way to the park, a cat streaked past and Dash and Lady went bounding after it, barking their heads off.
Pepper, Princess and Lucky followed them and all the dogs’ leads got tangled and I fell flat on the pavement.
Ouch!
I got up.
“My knee hurts, but I’m fine,” I said, dusting myself off.
We unravelled the leads and that’s when Aunty Vanessa noticed Aunty Vanessa laughed too.
She was relieved.
We waved goodbye and went on our way to take Lucky home.
“Princess’s collar is missing!” she said.
My aunty and I searched high and low for the diamond collar, but we couldn’t find it anywhere.
“Ooooh, what will Princess’s owner say?” moaned my aunty.
“Ziyanda likes her dog to look smart at all times!” “Good dog,” I said to Lucky as I patted his head.
His tongue hung out of his mouth, which made it look as if he was smiling.
His tail wagged all the way home.
And he never did understand why my aunty gave him two dog biscuits when we got to the front door of his home that day!
The dogs were growing impatient, tugging at their leads.
We gave up the search for the missing collar and walked to the park.
Aunty Vanessa threw a ball for Dash and Lady.
They sprinted across the park, fighting each other to see who would get to it first.
Pepper made a huge poo which my aunty made me clean up with a plastic motshegare mongwe le mongwe.

“My necklace!
Who has stolen my magic necklace?” he shouted.

Reading for pleasure is something we can do anywhere and anytime!
Edition 13 You can read May is Get-Caught-Reading Month!
It’s the month when we remind ourselves and others that reading is part of our daily lives.
Reading for pleasure is something we can do anywhere and anytime!
For example, you could try reading to your children when you get home from work, after bath time, immediately after supper, or first thing after Spend just 15 minutes a day reading storybooks aloud to your children.
Make it a relaxed and enjoyable time.
When your children realise that stories can be found in books, they will try to read for themselves.
Good readers at school are often the children who read at home with family and friends.
Many parents and grandparents set aside a special time every day to read to their children or grandchildren.

Good readers at school are often the children who read at home with family and friends.
Where do you usually read?
What is the most unusual place you can think of to enjoy a book?
This month try reading to your children in different places.
Read to them on the way to school in the taxi or bus, or when they are in the bath.
Over a weekend, when you have more time, go for a walk together in a park, at the beach or in the mountains, and take some books and a blanket with you.
As you walk along, look out for a nice reading spot – then settle down on the blanket, relax and read!
Weave books and reading into the everyday conversations you have with friends, family and work colleagues.
Start the conversation by talking about a book that you are enjoying at the moment or have enjoyed before.
Then invite others to talk about what they are reading at the moment or have read recently.
The easiest way to encourage others to read, is simply by being a reading role model yourself – when you regularly read for enjoyment, you show others that reading is a worthwhile leisure activity.
So, this May don’t forget to get caught reading!
Let’s use this month to encourage others to connect or reconnect with reading – whether that means reading a novel, a picture book, a biography, poetry, a blog, or just their favourite magazine or the sports pages in the newspaper!
Join us.
Be a literacy role model.
Reading club corner There are lots of days to celebrate in May.
Rather than trying to focus on all of them, you could choose one or two and then plan reading club activities around them.
Here are some ideas.
Get-Caught-Reading Month World Laughter Day 13 May Mother’s Day 15 May International Day of Families 16 May Biographer’s Day World Laughter Day (6 May): In the week before World Laughter Day, encourage the children to find or make up their own jokes.
Then, at the reading club meeting closest to World Laughter Day, invite them to tell their jokes to the group.
Provide paper and crayons or pencil crayons, and let them write down their joke and draw a picture to go with it.
Display all the jokes and encourage the children to read them over the next few weeks.
Mother’s Day (13 May): At a reading club session before 13 May, let the children make Mother’s Day cards to give to their mothers or the mother-figures in their lives.
They could design their own cards or use the card template on page 3.
On the day closest to Mother’s Day, read the special Mother’s Day story (Mom’s best vase) on pages 13 and 15, and do the suggested activities on page 4.

Edition 13 A call to action According to the National Academy of Education and National Institute of Education, reading aloud has been shown to be the single most important activity for building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading.
Go ya ka National Academy of Education le National Institute of Education, puisetsogodimo Every year, since Nal’ibali started their World Read Aloud Day activities in 2013, a South African author has been commissioned by the campaign to write a special story that is translated into all 11 official South African languages.
Everyone across the country can then read this story aloud to their children, their neighbours’ children, and children at libraries on that particular day.
Each year, the numbers of those who take part in World Read Aloud Day has increased with the numbers rising steadily from 13 401 in 2013 to an incredible 719 627 last year.
In 2017, Nal’ibali was lucky enough to have Buhle Ngaba, Mohale Mashigo, Hlubi Mboya and Sindiwe Magona reading aloud to some of the children.
s 2017 wound down, South Africa heard news that broke our collective hearts.
A report by Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) alerted us that 78% of South African children in Grade 4 cannot read for meaning in any language.
How do we turn this around?
World Read Aloud Day 2018 took place on 1 February and I was honoured to be the writer of this year’s story, The final minute.
I came home so that I could read it to 1 000 children in Soweto.
cousins, and all South Africans of goodwill, to take some time from their day on 1 February to read aloud to the children in their lives.
Illiteracy will not end just through doing this, but it is a good way to start reducing it.
More so if those of us who take part in World Read Aloud Day commit to reading aloud to children more frequently.
For my part, I have committed to read aloud to children at least once every two weeks during the four months I will be home from 1 February until 31 May.
I want to play my part in ensuring that when PIRLS does the next report on literacy, there will be more children who can read, and that children will read because they enjoy it.
I hope you, fellow South Africans, will join me.

Each year on World Read Aloud Day, Nal’ibali reminds everyone who lives in South Africa about the benefits of reading aloud to children.
And we’ve been reading to more and more children each year.
When we first started in 2013, 13 401 children were read to.
And this year – five years later – over a million children across the country were read to!
That’s a new record for Nal’ibali and South Africa!
In preparation for World Read Aloud Day on 1 February 2018, we produced a special story, The final minute (written by Zukiswa Wanner and illustrated by Rico) that featured the Nal’ibali characters, Neo, Mbali and Priya.
The story was available in all 11 official languages.
(You can still find the story on our website: www.nalibali.org.)
Nal’ibali also partnered with Blind SA to produce a version of the story in Braille, and with Sign Language Education and Development (SLED) to make a digital video in South African Sign Read-aloud sessions were held by members of the public, the campaign’s national network of literacy activists called FUNda Leaders, Nal’ibali’s own Literacy Mentors who support over 1 000 reading clubs in six provinces, as well as fellow NGOs and other partners.
Photographs and information about these sessions was shared on Nal’ibali’s Facebook page and Twitter feed as they took place on the day, to allow children and adults in different parts of the country to connect and share in the joy of this nationwide event.
This year, Nal’ibali’s main event was held in collaboration with the Department of Basic Education and took place at the Mofolo Cultural Bowl in Mofolo Park, Soweto.
Things got started at 10 a.m. when a thousand children from nearby schools – Moetapele Primary School, Nka-Thuto Primary School, Shalom-Manne Primary School, Tlhatlogang Secondary School and Thabisang Primary School – arrived at the park.
FUNda Leader and storyteller, Bongani Godide, opened the event, and Nal’ibali’s Managing Director, Jade Jacobsohn, welcomed everyone before Enoch Rabotapi from the Department of Basic Education gave a speech.
Then it was the turn of the Nal’ibali team from Gauteng to get everyone to have fun by singing some action songs.

Soccer players from Orlando Pirates gave a short speech about how being a good soccer player and a reader require the same thing: discipline.
Then it was the moment that everyone had gathered for – to listen to our special story being read aloud by its author, Zukiswa Wanner.
Zukiswa read the story in English, while Bongani read it in isiZulu and Nal’ibali’s PR and Events Co-ordinator, Petunia Thule, read it in Sesotho.
Before the children went back to school, they each collected a copy of the Nal’ibali World Read Aloud Day Supplement and the storybook, Refilwe, by Zukiswa Wanner to take with them.
It was a fun and inspiring World Read Together, on World Read Aloud Day, we read to children across South Africa!

But how will they build one?
Write a review of this story and stand a chance of winning mrs-penguins-perfect-palace_interior.indd 5 5/22/2016 11:19:38 AM After you have finished reading the story, have a discussion with your children.
You could ask questions like those below.
Remember to always encourage your children to explain the reasons for their opinions.
How many homes did the penguins build?
Let’s look and see what materials they used to build each one.
(Together look at pages 6, 10, 16, 17 and 23.)
Each time the penguins worked together to build a home.
Who do you think was the leader?
Do you think everyone worked equally hard?
How would you feel if someone in your group didn’t work as hard as you?
What would you do?
Give your children lots of different kinds of materials and suggest that they make one of the three homes in the story.
Here are some ideas for materials: glue, paint, bottle tops, tin foil containers, small and medium cardboard boxes, match boxes, polystyrene trays and cups, wool, wrapping paper, coloured paper, playdough, clay, shells, thin sticks, leaves, acorns and sand.
(If you are doing this activity at your reading club or in your classroom, encourage the children to work together in pairs or groups, just like the penguins in the story did!)
Ask your children to think about their dream home and then to draw a picture of it.
Afterwards let the children tell you about their pictures.
Titilope’s silly game Titilope is a little girl who enjoys playing with wasps.
Even though her mother tells her not to and warns her that the wasps could sting her, Titilope still finds a way to play with them.
Before you read the story, talk to your children about what it feels like to be stung by a wasp or a bee.
If they have been stung before, let them share their experiences.
After you have read the story, talk about the lessons that you and your children think Titilope may have learnt.
Encourage your children to write a letter (or note) that Titilope may have written to her mother after she had recovered from being stung by the wasps.
Then write the letter/note her mother may have written back to Titilope!
Busi is a very happy frog, except for one thing – she looks different than all the other frogs because one of her back legs is extra long and thick.
Busi doesn’t like looking different.
Then one day, a little girl needs Busi’s help to escape from a cruel eagle, and Busi learns that the thing she likes least about herself, is actually a special gift!
Encourage your children to use playdough or clay and other materials to create a scene from the story.
Then let them tell you about the scene they have created as well as what happened before and after it.
Have fun jumping around like frogs, or playing a jumping game you know.

We spoke to Zukiswa about the power of reading.
A reading warrior Do you think it’s important for children to be read to in a language they understand?
Absolutely.
I also think the more languages children can speak, the more empowering it is.
How did your love of reading and writing come about?
My love of reading started when I was a child because I saw my parents reading, and children tend to emulate their parents.
Writing came to me much later.
I had just returned home to South Africa, and I was working with the late Alf Kumalo at his museum.
I found myself with a lot of free time between visits from tourists, archiving his amazing photograph portfolio, and writing proposals so the museum could get funding.
I used this free time to write.
Whose responsibility is it to foster a culture of reading amongst I think it’s a collective responsibility: family/guardians and schools.
When I was at primary school in Zimbabwe, our timetable included 45 minutes of quiet reading in class every day.
We also had a library period once a week where we would borrow books from the school library.
We would generally finish our books so fast that we would circulate them amongst our classmates.
What’s your favourite book and why?
I think it’s next to impossible for any reader to have just one favourite book.
I have too many favourites.

Busi was a happy frog, but one thing made her sad.
She looked different from her brothers, her sisters, and all the other frogs.
Her face was the same.
Her body was the same.
But one of Busi’s back legs was extra long and thick.
Sometimes the other young frogs teased her about her strange leg, and this made Busi Busi watched as a young girl in a very dirty dress made her way down to the river.
She sat down on the rock next to Busi, and started to cry.
“Don’t cry, little girl,” said the frog gently, but the child just cried more.
“Oh, Frog,” she sobbed, “I’ll never be able to go home again!
That cruel eagle stole me from my village last week, and now I am his slave!” “If only I looked like everybody else!” she often said with a sigh.
“If only I wasn’t so ugly!” Just then, they heard the eagle’s harsh voice calling out from his cave, “Girl, are you still there?
If I don’t hear the sound of beating soon, you’ll be in BIG trouble!” “Grandpa is right!” said Mama Frog.
“How can such a special little frog “My friend,” said Busi quickly, “you have no time to lose!
Give me your dress, and then run away as fast as you can.
I’ll beat the dress against these rocks, and the eagle will hear the noise.
By the time he finds out you’ve gone, you’ll be home again with your mother!” But Busi didn’t believe them.
When the frogs sat croaking on the bank of the river in the long summer evenings, Busi sat behind the rest of them so that no one would see her extra long back leg.
And when they caught flies for lunch, she tucked that leg out of sight, so that she looked more like the others.
“Frog, you’re so kind,” said the girl.
“But how can a tiny creature like you beat the dress hard enough to make a loud noise?” “Well,” said Busi, “you haven’t seen my special, strong leg yet!” Shyly, the frog showed the little girl her long, thick back leg, which had been tucked underneath her as usual.
Then the child knew she had a chance.
She pulled off her dress and dipped it into the water.
When it was wet, she beat it against a big rock a few times.
Then she passed the dress quickly to Busi.
She kissed the frog on her forehead, whispered, “Thank you,” and ran away.
WHACK!
WHACK!
WHACK!
went the wet dress, as Busi slapped it against the rock for a long time.
Her extra long leg was so powerful that it was easy for her to make a loud noise.
It was only when the eagle again shouted for the girl to hurry up, that Busi threw the dress down, jumped into the river with a plop and swam away quickly.
mother when Busi reached home.
“Where Further down the river, in a gloomy cave high up on the mountain lived a wicked eagle.
“Stay far away from that eagle!” Mama Frog often warned.
One day, when Busi was feeling very sad, she decided to go for a swim on her own.
“I’m too ugly to play with the others,” she thought.
“I’d rather spend the day alone.” As she hugged Busi, she the little frog’s forehead, right on the spot where the girl had kissed her.
The little frog swam for a long time, then she crawled out of the water to rest on the grassy river bank.
Lying there in the sun, she looked up, and saw the eagle’s cave.
“How beautiful you are!” all Busi’s brothers and sisters agreed.
When Busi saw her reflection in the water, she smiled a huge, wide frog smile.
She was happy that she looked so than that, she was happy that her extra long leg wasn’t such a bad thing “I’d better not stay here!” she thought to herself.
She was about to jump back into the river when she heard voices drifting down from the cave.
“Sir,” Busi heard a child’s voice say, “I’ve swept the cave and prepared your lunch.
Please may I go down to the river while you eat, so I can wash my dress?
It’s the only one I have now, and it’s very dirty.” “Do you think I’m a fool, little girl?” shrieked a loud, angry voice.
“If I let you go near the river, you’ll just run away!” “Oh no, Sir,” the frog heard the child say.
“I won’t run away.
You’ll know I’m still here because you’ll hear me beating my wet dress against the rocks until it is clean.” mathateng a MAGOLO!” a dula kwa morago ga tsone tsotlhe gore go se nne le ope wa bone yo Look at these pictures from Titilope’s silly game.

when reading clubs take a break!
Holiday to continue enjoying and exploring stories during the school holidays.
In reading-for-enjoyment holiday programmes the emphasis is always on reading for pleasure!
The activities that make up the programmes have one aim: to spark and sustain children’s love of reading and stories.
Edition 14 AY E D I T I T S AT S I A There are many benefits to holiday programmes that focus on reading for enjoyment.
Here are some of them.
 Holiday programmes help children to see reading as something you do in your free time.
Seeing reading as an enjoyable leisure time activity is an important step in helping children to become lifelong readers.
 Holidays are usually less busy times.
This means that there is more time available for reading-forenjoyment activities than there is during the school term.
So, holiday programmes can be relaxed and they can run for longer each day than reading-club sessions do during term times.
 Children who aren’t already members of a reading club can be included in holiday programmes.
This introduces them to how satisfying stories, books and reading can be.
It encourages them to become regular readers and even to join a reading club!
 Holiday programmes keep children busy and entertained in relaxed and safe environments.
They are especially important if the children’s parents are working, and in communities where there are not a lot of things for children to do during the school holidays.
Children attend reading-for-enjoyment holiday programmes not because someone has told them that they have to, nor because they are rewarded for doing so.
They attend simply because it is a fun and Find out more about running a reading-for-enjoyment holiday programme on page 3 of this supplement and in our Story Power Guide 5, which is available for free at www.nalibali.org.

AY E D I T I holiday ideas T S AT S I A Whether you are at home with your own children or running a holiday programme, here are some activities that incorporate reading and writing to keep your children entertained during the holidays.
The idea is to enjoy yourselves, so use the language/s you and your children feel most comfortable with.
Try something old and new.
Together read stories by authors you have not tried before.
Also encourage your children to introduce their favourite books to their friends and/or siblings.
Write the story’s words.
Together look at a picture book that does not have any words.
Then challenge everyone to write their own words for the story on separate sheets of paper.
(Remember to write down the page numbers too so that you know where the words go!)
Help younger children do this by writing down the words they tell you.
When you have all finished, take turns reading your story words aloud while someone turns the pages of the book.
Notice the ways in which each of your stories is similar and/or different.
Record your memories.
Invite your children to draw pictures, use photographs, cut out words from newspapers and magazines, and use their own words to create posters or books called: My memories.
Host a talk show.
Choose a story that you have all read.
Then choose one person to be the TV talk show host and others to be the characters from the book.
Let the host interview the characters from the book.
lotlhe.
Jaanong tlhopha motho a le mongwe go nna mogasi wa Create a letter without writing.
Let your children cut out words from old newspapers or magazines and then paste them on paper to make a letter to a friend or family member.
Tell a story.
Ask your children to find something that is small enough to fit into a pocket, and then to tell a story about it.
Create a story wall.
Find some space on a wall and stick up large sheets of blank paper.
Give your children crayons and pencils and ask them to write and draw about the stories they enjoy.
Keep it short.
Challenge your children to write a 50-word story set in the winter.
Play a game.
Here is a game that stimulates your children’s imagination and encourages critical thinking.
Write some “Would you rather …?” questions linked to winter on separate strips of paper.
(For example: Would you rather sleep in a house made of large blocks of ice or one made of large cardboard boxes?
Would you rather be stuck on top of a mountain in the winter or in the summer?
If you could only wear one thing to keep warm, would you rather wear a scarf around your neck or socks on your feet?
Would you rather walk barefoot across some snow or on the hot tar of a road?)
Fold up the questions and put them in a container.
Let everyone have a turn to take out a question and be the first to answer it.
Then let everyone else answer the question too.
Remember to encourage everyone to give a reason or reasons for their answer.
Be an inventor.
Ask your children to invent a machine to help do chores at home more easily.
Let them draw a picture of their machine and label it to show how it works.
They could even try to make a model of the machine using recycled materials.
Use what excites you about stories and books to help you create a fun and inspiring programme.
But whatever activities you choose, proper planning is important.
Here are some ideas to guide you.
Draw up a programme of activities for each day.
Choose different types of activities to keep the programme interesting.
Many of the activities can relate to the stories you have chosen, but include other reading or writing activities too.
Remember that many of the children will come back day after day so you will need different stories, songs and games.
Practise doing the stories and activities you’ve chosen so that you know how much time they’ll take to complete.
Advertise your holiday programme at school parent meetings, in newsletters and on notice boards at libraries, clinics and schools.
Organise a sign-up day so that you know how many children will be taking part in the programme.
This will help you decide what resources you need.
Invite parents and other caregivers to come and register their children for the programme about two weeks before it starts.
Plan how you will make the venue attractive.
Think about how to set up quieter areas where children will be able to look at or read books on their own, and other areas suitable for the Make reading for enjoyment part of your school!

Explain your opinion.
Ask your children to imagine that the boy from the story keeps a diary in which he records what happens each day, as well as his thoughts and his feelings.

But at her funeral, they all claim to be her relative so that they can inherit her large pile of gold.
What will it take to prove who her real relatives are?
Encourage your children to use the following materials to make a crocodile: a long egg carton or egg tray, cardboard, scissors, glue, green paint and kokis.
After you have finished reading the story, discuss some of these questions.
If you were Crocodile and you had woken up at your own funeral, what would you have said or done?
What do you think would have happened if Crocodile had really been dead?
How would it have been decided who her relatives are?
Who are your relatives?
What do you have in common with them?

I walked slowly so I didn’t attract attention and then I ran.
Man, I ran!
I felt as if my feet had wings.
My heart was pounding with a new feeling.
I have never felt such happiness.
I punched the air with my fist.
I ducked and disappeared into the crowd.

I saw the woman by the entrance to the wholesalers.
She had a small girl with her, clinging to her skirt.
I watched her take out a bundle of money knotted into a dirty piece of cloth.
She counted the notes and coins secretively, keeping them close to her body.
She frowned and tucked the money into a hidden pocket in her skirt.
She swung the child onto her hip and entered the shop.
I turned to slip away.
But the crowd was pressing around me, so I hesitated.
The little girl smiled and buried her face shyly in her mother’s shoulder.
Was it her smile that made me lose my head?
Was that why I took such a chance?
I get away every time.
I walk slowly at first so as not to attract attention and then, when I have gained enough distance, I run.
I weave in and out of the crowds, my heart pounding – I disappear.
But this time I didn’t.
I stayed; trailing the woman in the shop, watching her as she lifted the bag of mealie meal into her trolley, watching as she put the cooking oil back on the shelf.
I saw her pick up a small bar of green soap and a bag of dried beans.
I watched as she went up to the till.
I knew exactly what was going to happen.
She cried out in shock and I could see her panic as her hands hunted through her pockets again and again.
The cashier didn’t care.
He pushed a button under his till to call the manager, a bored look on his face.

interior.indd 7 interior.indd 22 interior.indd 10 Illustrations by Samantha van Riet “But you don’t lay eggs,” sang the birds.
All the animals knew that Crocodile had a big pile of gold in her house, but none of them had ever seen it because Crocodile was nasty and mean.
She would chase them away and bite them with her sharp teeth.
The fish popped out of the river and sprayed water on the birds.
The birds took off into the sky and flapped around.
One hot day in summer, Monkey was out walking by the river when he saw Crocodile lying in the sunshine.
Monkey, who was very naughty, picked up a stick and poked Crocodile on the side of her body.
Crocodile didn’t move, so Monkey poked her again.
“Why did you do that?” asked one of the birds.
“If you really are Crocodile’s relatives, then you would love water,” said the fish.
“Besides, did you ever see Crocodile fly?” And soon all the animals of the bushveld were fighting amongst themselves and shouting.
“Stop, everybody!
Stop!” said Tortoise, but no one would listen to him.
Suddenly, Tortoise felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around.
Something terrible was looking down at him.
It had great big eyes and very sharp teeth.
It was Crocodile!
“I thought you were dead,” said Tortoise, shaking in his shell.
“I was sleeping,” said Crocodile in her big voice.
“But all this noise woke Tortoise mumbled an apology and scuttled off into the bushveld.
Crocodile turned to the other animals.
“Hey!” she shouted.
Everyone stopped fighting and was silent.
They looked at Crocodile with wide eyes.
“She must be dead,” said Monkey.
He ran off to tell the other animals.
All the animals arrived to have a funeral for Crocodile.
They stood around her body and talked.
They wanted to know who would get Crocodile’s big pile of gold.
They all wanted the gold, of course, but the law of the bushveld said that the gold belonged to Crocodile’s relatives.
And that was the problem – nobody knew who Crocodile’s living relatives were.
So wise Tortoise called a big meeting on the river bank to find out.
First the birds, with their colourful feathers and beautiful voices, stood up to speak.
“We must be the living relatives of our dear mother Crocodile,” they sang together.
“Even though Crocodile was not as beautiful as we are, she laid big eggs in the sand.
We deserve her big pile of gold.” The other animals shouted, “NOOO!” and the birds sat down.
“That is very true,” said Tortoise.
“Crocodile did lay big eggs in the sand.
Does anyone else have something to say about it?” The lizard clan stood up, and hissed at the birds.
“That’s rubbish,” said the leader of the lizards.
“I know plenty of lizards who also lay eggs, and we aren’t birds at all.
Crocodile was a member of our clan because of her scaly skin.
We “That’s better,” said Crocodile.
“So you all want my gold, do you?
Well, firstly, I would like to have dinner with my living relatives.
So who wants to stay and eat something delicious?” asked Crocodile licking her lips.
deserve the big pile of gold.” “The birds are your relatives,” said the fish, swimming away quickly.
The other animals shouted, “NOOO!” and the lizards sat down.
“Oh, no, the buck are,” said the birds flying off into the treetops.
“They have four legs.” But the buck clan had already disappeared into the bushes.
“That is also very true,” said Tortoise.
“Crocodile does have scaly skin.
Does anyone else have something to say about it?” “Well,” said the lizards, “that leaves only us.
Oh please, don’t gobble us There was a splash from the river, and four blue heads popped out of the water.
“We don’t care if she laid eggs, or had scaly skin,” said the fish.
“We have scales too, and we used to watch Crocodile swim underwater every day.
She was a fish, just like us.
We deserve the big pile of gold.” “Gobble you up?” said Crocodile smiling.
“Why would I eat my own relatives?
Come on, lizards.
Let’s go and have dinner.” “Oh no, that’s not true,” said the leader of the lizards.
“Just look at her lying there.
She has four legs.
Show me a fish with four legs.” So the lizards followed Crocodile to her hut, where they ate marula cake and drank delicious spring water, and told jokes and laughed until it was dark outside.
And from that day on, all the animals knew that the lizards were the true living relatives of Crocodile, and that when she did actually die, they “But she swam,” said the fish.
“Wait!” said Springbok.
“Crocodile has four legs.
Everyone in the buck clan has four legs too, so she must have been a buck.
We deserve the big pile of gold.” Diphologolo tse dingwe tsa goa, “NNYAA!” mme mekgantitswane ya dula mo fatshe.

How much print is there in your children’s environment?
Do they see signs, notices, newspapers and magazines around them?
And how many languages are these things written in?
Children learn to read more easily when they are surrounded by print because print-rich environments show them what reading and writing can be used for.
Here are some ideas to help you create a print-rich environment at home, school or your reading club.
Look for print everywhere.
Collect different types of writing that you think would interest your children.

It is a dirty, smelly beast!
Unathi discovers that although she and the beast may be different in some ways, there are other ways in which they are similar.
And so, Unathi learns that someone doesn’t have to be exactly the same as you to be your friend.

Young children enjoy them, but older children who find reading difficult often enjoy them too.
Wordless picture books are useful if there are not a lot of books published in your language, and can also be used in multilingual classrooms or reading clubs.
But wordless picture books are more than just fun to use.
They also: help your children learn how stories are structured – they have a beginning, a middle and an end.
increase your children’s vocabulary as they try using new words to name unfamiliar things in the pictures, or try to use new words in their story.
encourage creativity because your children have to use their imagination to tell the story – and there is no “right” or “wrong” way to tell it!
Here are some tips to help you use wordless picture books with children.
Read the title (or translate it and say it in your language) and then flip through the book looking at the pictures with your children.
Now you’re ready to start again at the beginning and to tell the story from the pictures.
You can tell the story or invite your children to do this.
Or, make it up together using the pictures to guide you.
Comment on things in the pictures, and make connections between them and your child’s life.
For example: “Where do you think that mouse is going?
Do you remember we saw a mouse in the backyard this morning?” Reading club corner August has a number of special days on which we can celebrate the diversity of people!

Now sshh!” “Oh no!” gasped Motlatsi and Tshepo as their black and red kite landed on Mrs Ntshona’s roof winding itself around the TV aerial.
“Quick!
“Quick!
Now sshh!” “Oh no!” gasped Motlatsi and Tshepo as their black and red kite landed on Mrs Ntshona’s roof winding itself around the TV aerial.
“Quick!
We must pull it loose!” shouted Tshepo.
Motlatsi grabbed the string and tugged.
To his horror, the TV aerial that was already old, bent over until it almost touched the tiles on their neighbour’s roof.
It’s just that if you promise someone that you won’t do something, then you must not do it – ever.
Like when you promised Sibongile you’d find her new pen and you did!
Now sshh!” “Oh no!” gasped Motlatsi and Tshepo as their black and red kite landed on Mrs Ntshona’s roof winding itself around the TV aerial.
They saw Mrs Ntshona look at her cellphone.
She was about to make a call.
“She’s going to phone Dad!
Oh no!
How can we stop her?” said Motlatsi.
He was about to run away when Tshepo took a risk.
He was about to run away when Tshepo took a risk.
He stepped out, straight “Hello, Mrs Ntshona,” said Tshepo walking towards the fence.
“I’m so sorry about your aerial.” Mrs Ntshona looked him up and down with her lips pinched shut.
She was breathing fast.
“A new aerial costs money you know, Tshepo.
Perhaps you must find work and buy me a new one!” Her voice rang out loud as a bell.
“My dad gives us pocket money,” said Motlatsi coming up to stand beside his brother.
“We will use our pocket money to buy you a new aerial.” He wished he hadn’t said that, but he knew he had to.
“Really?” said Mrs Ntshona as her voice rose higher.
“When do you get pocket money and how much?” “Dad will be so angry!” Tshepo cried, covering his face with his hands.
“We each get five rand a week,” they whispered together, backing away a little.
“Not half as angry as Mrs Ntshona!” Motlatsi replied.
He grabbed his brother and ducked behind the garage.
“Look!
There she is!” “That’s ten rand a week.
We can save up …” said Tshepo, his voice trailing off.
It could take a long time to pay for a new aerial and Dad would find out what Sure enough, Mrs Ntshona stood outside her kitchen door with her hands on her hips.
It could take a long time to pay for a new aerial and Dad would find out what Sure enough, Mrs Ntshona stood outside her kitchen door with her hands on her hips.
The boys could see that she was angry.
She looked up at the roof and saw the bent aerial.
Her eyes widened.
She shook her head.
Her two eyebrows came together in the middle of her face.
She tapped her foot on the floor.
Her lips were one straight line.
The brothers were so busy looking at each other helplessly that they forgot about Mrs Ntshona.
When they looked at her again, they were surprised.
The boys held their breath.
“Dad told us to fly the kite only in the park and we promised we would!” whispered Tshepo to his brother.
“Children, I had a kite once.
It was grey and pink.
I stood in the garden of my grandfather’s house in Lesotho holding its string.
It rose high into the sky.
It looked so happy.
I let it go.
I watched it sail higher and higher until I couldn’t see it anymore.” “Maybe Dad will take away our kite,” replied Tshepo, “or he won’t give us money to buy sweets again.” He stared into his brother’s eyes.
“We didn’t listen to him!
What do you think he will do?” His foot kicked the dust.
I watched it sail higher and higher until I couldn’t see it anymore.” “Maybe Dad will take away our kite,” replied Tshepo, “or he won’t give us money to buy sweets again.” He stared into his brother’s eyes.
She smiled at the boys.
“It’s okay, Tshepo and Motlatsi.
I won’t tell your father.
That old aerial was useless anyway.
I needed to buy a new one.
I’ll get the ladder and you can climb up and get your kite.” A look of disappointment passed over Motlatsi’s face.
“Ssh!
What else?” “We broke our promise.
A promise is forever.” Tshepo sat down and put his head in his hands.
“So what happens now?” asked Motlatsi as he bit his nails.
Tshepo scratched his head.
“Dad won’t trust us again.” “What does that mean, Tshepo?
What is trust?” ask Motlatsi.
“Ssh!
Not so loud!
Mrs Ntshona will hear us!
I think it means that he won’t believe us when we tell him something,” Tshepo whispered.
“You mean like when I said that I passed Maths at school?” asked “No, he believed that because he read your school report,” said Tshepo.
“You mean like when I said that I passed Maths at school?” asked “No, he believed that because he read your school report,” said Tshepo.
“You mean like if I tell him I ate ice-cream for lunch?” suggested Motlatsi, trying to understand.
Tshepo shook his head.
“Not exactly,” he said.
“It has to be something “Like when I lost the two rand he gave me?” asked Motlatsi.
“I told him it dropped out of my pocket.” “He knew that was true because you had a hole in your pocket,” explained Tshepo.
As she walked away the brothers heard her say, “I might even have some hot chocolate and cake in the kitchen when you come down!” “What then?
Does it mean Dad will go away and never come back?
Or will he send us away?” asked Motlatsi, about to cry.
The boys just looked at each other and smiled.

Edition 14 What about the girls?
In South Africa, August is Women’s Month!
We pay tribute to the women in this country who have fought and continue to fight for freedom and equality for all.
What we tell our children about girls and women is an important part of building a more equal society.
And we tell them about girls and women in lots of different ways.
One of these is through the stories we share with them.
the main female characters make decisions about how they live their lives?
If they don’t, is this perhaps because the story is trying to show that treating woman as inferior, is wrong?
It is good for girls and boys to read books about the real-life achievements of women, as well as stories that provide them with different kinds of female role models.
The more children read stories with strong female role models in them, the more girls are encouraged to become strong women and boys learn not to be threatened by strong women.
Stories have the power to shape the way we see ourselves and the world.
The stories children hear and read help them to work out who they are, what their place in the world is and how they relate to others.
If we want to build a more equal society, the stories that we share with children should not teach them to feel inferior nor superior because of their gender.
What is left out in the stories we read, is as important as what is in them!
For example, if the only characters in the stories we read are boys, then our children learn that girls and women don’t matter.
If boys are always the heroes in the stories, our children learn that only men can be leaders.
So, we need to think carefully about the books we choose to read to our children.
Here are a few questions to help you.
women (especially black women) always shown as needing help, while men are always in leadership and action roles?
the achievements of girls and women based on their own initiative and intelligence?
Or do they achieve because of the way they look or because a boy or man helps them?
g Do the girls or women in the story have to change to be accepted?

Many people have had the course of their lives changed by the generosity, courage and/or sacrifice of an ordinary woman.
Ask your children to write a letter of appreciation to a woman who has made a difference in their lives.
If they need help getting started with a poem, let them write the letters of the word “women” one underneath the other and use these letters to start each line of their poem about women.
Invite very young children to think about all the women that they know and then to draw pictures of the ones that are important to them.
If they are learning to write, suggest that they try writing a few words or a sentence about each woman on their own.
If they prefer, they could also tell you the words that they want you to write for them.

Journalist Ferial Haffajee has faced this dilemma when speaking her mind.
Ferial was born in Cape Town, and her mom wanted her to become a lawyer.
She studied law, but didn’t really like it, so after graduating, she started working as a trainee journalist at the Mail & Guardian newspaper in 1991.
Ferial wrote down her goals in life and one of them was to become an editor.
After working for different newspapers, she became editor of the Mail & Guardian in February 2004, making her the first female editor of a major newspaper in South Africa.
Later, she became editor of City Press.
At an international fashion show in New York in 2009, models dressed in Stoned Cherrie clothes took to the runway with brightly coloured patterns, beading and embroidery.
Nkhensani’s designs used a variety of textures.
The skirts and dresses had different styles, and her T-shirts, printed with Steve Biko’s face, became a signature feature of her brand.
Through fashion, she showed the rich diversity of African heritage to the world.

Today, as a result of the activism of the many who fought alongside Prudence, HIV has become a disease that can be lived with, if we get the right treatment and healthcare services.
Prudence started the Positive Women’s Network in 1996 and helped form other organisations that encouraged and supported women (and men) to understand the virus, and learn how to manage it – like taking the right medication and eating healthy foods.
This difficult experience made her feel very alone and misunderstood.
It frustrated her that people did not understand how the virus worked or how it could be spread, but instead of hiding away in shame, she became an HIV activist.
When Prudence told the public about her status in 1992, South Africans were scared of HIV and AIDS.
This fear made people bully and humiliate others who had the virus.
When Prudence found out she was infected, she was studying medical technology at the Cape Town Technikon.
People at her school worried that she would infect other students in the laboratory, so she changed courses.
When I feel nervous or scared to speak up, I think of a brave woman named Prudence Mabele.
Prudence was the first Black woman in South Africa to publicly say that she was HIV-positive.
Breaking the silence: Prudence Mabele Her Story: I Have Fighting Power Having my hair brushed or combed is, to this day, a painful experience.
As a child, I used to dread the Sunday evenings when I would sit on a little red plastic chair in front of my mother, who got out the hair food, comb, and towel.
No good came from combing out the tangles, and I didn’t dare turn my head to look at the TV screen!
Dr Nonhlanhla Khumalo also dreaded her mother’s afro comb, but it inspired her to become a doctor.
In her matric year, she walked into a laboratory during a visit to the University of Natal, saw an electron microscope for the first time and decided to become a hair scientist.
She went on to research African hair, because there was so little information about it.
She and Professor David Ferguson created the first electron microscope “root-to-tip” scan of Black African hair.
Nonhlanhla wanted to understand why many Black women suffer from hair loss, and what effects chemicals, such as relaxers, have on Black hair.
This led her to create the first hair research clinic in Africa – the UCT Hair and Skin Research Laboratory – where students can now study trichology – the study of hair and the scalp.
Have you examined your hair?
How it stretches when you pull it and quickly bounces back when you let it go?
The world has long told Black girls that straight hair is the most beautiful, and for too long, we listened.

Carol Broomhall For how long have you been publishing children’s books?
Thirteen years!
What is your favourite part of producing children’s books?
Every book is unique and I love the challenge of making each book the best it can be.
I also love getting involved in children’s literacy projects so that we can reach more children and know that in some way we are helping to grow a love of reading.
It is incredibly rewarding to watch children interact with and read the books we make!
Buka e nngwe le e nngwe e kgethegile mme ke rata kgwetlho Did someone read to you or tell you stories when you were a child?
At home, my mother, father and grandparents told me stories.
At primary school, we had a wonderful librarian who read to us and kept us wanting more!
She also let us choose what we wanted to read from the library.
I was always going to the library!
Did you read to your children when they were young?
Why?
Yes, for so many reasons!
I love books and stories, so I enjoyed spending time with my children sharing, connecting and talking about books.
The book I most enjoy reading to children is … The long trousers by Maryanne and Shayle Bester.
Do you ever re-read books?
Yes, some books have changed the way I see and understand things and they inspire me.

Gakologelwa go tsenya The giraffe and the fox Retold by Nicky Webb Illustrations by Simphiwe Mangole “Some friend you are!” shouted the giraffe, waking the fox.
They were both very good at stealing and spent a lot of time together getting up to no good.
“Don’t be angry,” said the fox.
“Thanks to your singing I have been beaten black and blue.” Once upon a time there was a giraffe and a bat-eared fox who were very good friends.
“Let’s cross the river and steal some food from the farm over there.” The fox held onto the giraffe’s neck and the giraffe swam out into the river.
When the giraffe reached the deepest part of the river, he said to the fox, “I am going to take a bath now.
I feel all hot and bothered after that beating.” “Great idea!” said the giraffe, licking his lips.
“I told you I always sing once I have finished my food.
“Let’s cross the river and steal some food from the farm over there.” The fox held onto the giraffe’s neck and the giraffe swam out into the river.
“You can’t!” said the fox, staring at the giraffe with bulging eyes.
“If you go under the water, I will drown!
The fox held tightly to the giraffe’s long neck because he could not swim.
“But I must bath,” said the giraffe.
“It’s my custom.” With that, the giraffe ducked under the water.
The fox sputtered and thrashed his paws.
I cannot swim!” On the other side of the river, the clever fox made a hole in the farmer’s fence with his sharp teeth.
Then the fox and the giraffe squeezed quietly through the fence to steal food on the other side.
The fox stole five eggs from the hen coop and the giraffe chewed through a patch of lettuce.
The giraffe was just starting on a juicy watermelon when the fox lifted his nose to the sky and gave a howl.
“Help!
Help!
I’m drowning!” the fox cried.
The giraffe was cross about his beating, but he felt terrible watching the fox splash around in the water.
The fox was his friend after all.
The giraffe put his head under the water and used it to lift the fox back onto his neck.
The fox coughed and choked and held on to the giraffe for When they reached the other side of the river, the fox thought about what he had done to his friend.
“Giraffe?” he said quietly.
“Yes, Fox,” answered the giraffe.
“I’m sorry for treating you badly.
I see that what you did to me was because of the bad way that I treated you earlier,” said Fox.
The fox sputtered and thrashed his paws.
“It was,” he said.
“I was paying you back for what you “Shhhhh,” hissed the giraffe spitting bits of watermelon all over the fox.
“What do you mean, ‘shhhhh’?” asked the fox wiping his whiskers.
“I always sing when I have finished my food.
It’s my custom.” “Well, wait for me to finish my watermelon,” crunched the giraffe.
“Otherwise the farmer is going to hear you and come and chase us away.” The fox was tired of waiting.
He lifted his nose to the sky again and started to sing, “Owoooooooo!” The farmer was having his lunch when he heard the fox howling.
He ran outside with his big stick.
The fox saw him coming and, being very quick, he dashed through the hole in the fence and was gone before the farmer even saw him.
“Sorry,” said the fox.
The poor giraffe, on the other hand, was standing with his front legs wide apart trying to enjoy the last of his watermelon.
When he saw the farmer coming, he tried to stand up and run away, but his legs became tangled and he fell over.
So, the fox and the giraffe had learnt that it is important to treat others the way we want to be treated, and from that day on, they always did so.
And, to this day, they are still the best of friends.
“Never, never steal from me again!” shouted the farmer, beating the giraffe with his stick.
When the giraffe eventually escaped, he was bruised all over his body and furious with the fox.
He limped over to the river where the fox was snoozing under a bush.

Edition 14 Playing with books Helping young children to develop the ability to read and write is a serious business because being literate is extremely important in our daily lives.
Edition 14 Playing with books Helping young children to develop the ability to read and write is a serious business because being literate is extremely important in our daily lives.
But we also need to remember that we don’t have to actively teach or tell children about books and reading.
Instead, we need to allow our children to learn about books by exploring them.
One of the ways we can do this is by giving them opportunities to play with books.
Being allowed to be playful with books helps children to become literate.
Here are some of the ways that children at different stages of development may “play” with books.
Babies like to try out books by touching, patting, shaking and even chewing them!
They are also great listeners and imitators.
Often they make sounds and clap their hands to show how much they are enjoying us reading to them.
Try giving babies board and cloth books when you want to allow them to handle books on their own, like during nappy changes.
These kinds of books are tough and don’t break easily.
Older babies enjoy books with flaps, pop-ups and buttons that they can press to make sounds.
They also like to point to things on the page, or to try turning the page.
Many toddlers like to pretend to read aloud and older children often like to pretend to be “the teacher” and read to the class.
They can be found turning the pages of a storybook telling their own story as they go, or retelling a story they have heard often – sometimes even with the book upside down!
They’re practising to read and showing you that they understand what books are about.
Encourage them by making sure that there are always some books around for them to pick up and “read” when they want to.
Young children often act out stories they know, or create their own, using familiar story characters.
In these imaginary play times, children learn about symbols – when they use a stick as a fairy’s magic wand or a box as a car, it means that they understand how one thing can “stand for” another.
This is important for literacy learning.
Encourage your children’s imaginary play by reading lots of different kinds of stories to them.
Playing with books offers children opportunities to learn important literacy lessons and – best of all – it’s what children do naturally when we read to them and when they have books to choose from in their environment.

Poems tell stories too.
Let the children read a poem and then act it out, or they can draw pictures that are inspired by the poem, or add their own verses to it.
Help the children explore how to create different kinds of texts.
They could work in groups to create a TV news report about one of the events in a story.
Or they could write a list of interview questions and then interview a classmate who pretends to be a character from the story.
Create a multilingual word wall.
Encourage the children to write down interesting words that they’ve read in stories and add them to the wall.
Encourage the children to imagine that they are going on a journey with one or more of the characters in a story.
They can draw pictures and write lists of the things they will need to take with them on the journey.
(If necessary, let younger children tell you what they want you to write for them on their lists.)
Invite the children to write a description of the appearance and personality of their favourite character from a story you have read together.
Or, let them draw a picture of their favourite characters and discuss each one with some classmates.

Here’s one called “People to people” for you to try.
 You need at least three people.
One person calls out the instructions while the others work in pairs.
They carry out the instructions which require them to “connect” different parts of their bodies to each other.
Here are some examples of instructions: “back to back”, “elbow to elbow”, “elbow to knee”, “nose to knee”.
 When the person calling out the instructions says, “people to people”, then the players have to find another partner and a new person calls out the instructions.

Skin we are in follows five friends – Njabulo, Aisha, Tim, Chris and Roshni – as they explore and discuss the skin they are in.
The Nal’ibali When you meet someone for the first time, is the colour of their skin one of the first things you notice about them?
But what can someone’s skin colour tell us about them?
Despite what some people say, your skin colour means very little!
Widely-acclaimed South African author and storyteller, Sindiwe Magona, teamed up with well-known anthropologist and science educator, Nina G. Jablonski, and awardwinning illustrator, Lynn Fellman, to create a much-needed book for children about race and skin colour – Skin we are in.
Skin we are in follows five friends – Njabulo, Aisha, Tim, Chris and Roshni – as they explore and discuss the skin they are in.
They discover why humans have different skin colours, and how people’s thinking about skin colour has changed throughout history.
The scientific text is written by Jablonski and it expands and supports the conversation topics that are part of the children’s adventure.
Skin we are in e sala morago ditsala tse tlhano – Njabulo, Aisha, Tim, Chris le “We’d like this book to help change the conversation around some difficult topics … to get children to think about something that is beautiful, natural and badly misunderstood,” explains Sindiwe Magona.
“We want children to grow up with healthy attitudes about skin colour.
This is a storybook, and the story is about the meaning of skin.
First, why we all have different skin colours; how it all began, what it means and, more interestingly, what it does not mean.
All children deserve to get the message, as early as possible, that they are perfect as they are, and that the colour of their skin does not have anything to do with their character or ability.
It has nothing to do with what they are capable of and what dreams they may cherish or goals they may set for themselves.
Skin colour is not a determinant of destiny.” Skin we are in is a beautiful book that has already got lots of positive reviews.
It is aimed at children between the ages of 8 and 12 and is already available in English, Sepedi, isiXhosa, isiZulu and Afrikaans.

She reported the matter to the king and queen.
But Mamanthwane was jealous of Legotlo.
When Legotlo’s wife heard this sad news, she was very angry!
She reported the matter to the king and queen.
But Mamanthwane had already heard about what was going to happen so he had flown away into the bush and hidden himself.
But Mamanthwane was jealous of Legotlo.
When the bat cooked, the food was always very good.
But Mamanthwane had already heard about what was going to happen so he had flown away into the bush and hidden himself.
The bat was jealous of all these things that Everyone turned up to search for the bat.
Legotlo also had a wife who loved him very much.
The bat was jealous of all these things that Everyone turned up to search for the bat.
The next day, the people of the village made their way into the bush to see if they could find Mamanthwane there.
They waited until he was asleep, then they caught him and took him straight to the king “I always boil myself in the water, and my flesh is sweet.
Legotlo and Mamanthwane always ate together.
When the bat cooked, the food was always very good.
“How is it that when you make the soup it is so tasty?” asked the bush rat.
When they arrived at the royal house, Legotlo and his wife were already there.
Mamanthwane was ashamed to look his friend, Legotlo, in the eye.
They waited until he was asleep, then they caught him and took him straight to the king “I always boil myself in the water, and my flesh is sweet.
That’s what makes the soup so good,” explained the bat.
But he was lying.
Mamanthwane offered to show the bush rat how it was done.
He got a pot of warm water that was not hot enough to burn anyone, but he told Legotlo that the water was boiling hot.
Then Mamanthwane jumped into the pot and quickly got out again.
When Mamanthwane served the soup, it tasted as good as usual.
Legotlo was amazed.
The bat’s trick really does work, he thought.
“Why would you do this to me?
We were best friends!” Legotlo said to the bat.
“Because I was jealous of you,” answered Mamanthwane.
“You have everything that I don’t have and everyone loves you and hates me.” The people of the village were shocked at Mamanthwane’s response.
They wondered why Mamanthwane hadn’t just asked his friend how he had managed to get everyone to love him.
Then the king said, “Well, you have just given everyone a reason to hate The king and queen ordered the guards to take Mamanthwane to jail.
The queen said, “Today we will lock you up!
Tomorrow we will decide how to punish you!” The next morning when the guards came to fetch Mamanthwane from his jail cell, he was not there.
He had escaped and no one knew how.
Legotlo and his wife were furious when they heard the news.
The king and queen were also very angry.
They ordered the people in the village to search for the bat again.
All day long the people tried to find and catch Mamanthwane, but they failed.
Mamanthwane had found a cave far away from the village that no one knew about.
The cave was hard to find.
Mamanthwane also decided to change one of his habits – from that day, he only came out to feed when it was dark.
After they had finished eating, the bush rat went home and told his wife that he was going to make good soup just like the bat’s.
His wife asked how he was going to do that.
“It’s a secret!” said Legotlo.
Legotlo asked his wife to boil some water, which she did.
When his wife was not looking, Legotlo jumped into the pot.
Soon he was boiling in the water!
“I am burning!” The bush rat’s wife rushed to pull him out, but the damage had already been done.
Legotlo was so badly burned that he had lost all his fur.
His skin was red and pink from the hot water.
“Why would you get into a pot of boiling water?” his wife asked.
“Because Mamanthwane told me that’s what makes his soup taste really When Legotlo’s wife looked at him and saw how injured he was, she cried.
“Because Mamanthwane told me that’s what makes his soup taste really When Legotlo’s wife looked at him and saw how injured he was, she cried.
She took him to the doctor, but the doctor wasn’t able to help him.
Instead, the doctor said that Legotlo would never grow fur again.
And so, that is why even today, you will never see Mamanthwane, the bat, during the day.

Edition 14 Each year on 8 September the world celebrates International Literacy Day.
On this day, we recommit ourselves to working towards making illiteracy a thing of the past, in South Africa and across the world.
So, what progress have we made with literacy in South Africa?
In 2017, the latest PIRLS results were released and it wasn’t good news!
This research showed that 78% of South African Grade 4 children cannot read for meaning in any language.
That’s 8 out of every 10 children!
And the South African Book Development Council’s reading survey didn’t paint a bright picture either.
It showed that only 6% of us read to our children and only 5% of us tell our children stories!
It is easy to feel hopeless in the face of this news, but we don’t have to.
There is one very simple but powerful thing we can do to help change the picture: read aloud to children!
If all adults read to the children in their lives for 15 minutes every day, children would grow up being surrounded by stories at home and at school.
They would grow up seeing reading as a satisfying and enjoyable activity and be motivated to read for themselves.
Join us in growing a nation of readers by committing to reading to the children in your life for 15 minutes every day!
What we mean by reading aloud What reading aloud is … and isn’t ba le 10!

Story ideas Have you thought about how to use stories to strengthen children’s learning in different subjects?
Here are some ideas for doing this in subjects other than languages.
Bring History to life by reading stories about events that happened in the past.
Stories about great discoveries and the lives of scientists, doctors, leaders and inventors provide role models as well as information.
mmogo le tshedimosetso.
Traditional stories are a wonderful way to get to know how people from different places and a different time understood the world around them.
Mainane a setso ke tsela e ntle thata ya go itse gore batho go tswa kwa mafelong Read a story that is set in another country and then let the children use the Internet and information books to find out more about this country.
Let the children use maps and/or atlases to find the places they read about in stories or to trace the journey of a story character.
Many children face challenging situations, like being on the receiving end of prejudice, or the death of a loved one, or divorce.
Stories give us a great starting point to discuss things that form part of Life Skills/ Life Orientation that are sometimes difficult to talk about.
Asking openended questions about a story offers a safe way for children to think and talk about their personal concerns, emotions or ideas.
Stories can help children to better understand a challenging situation, discover how to cope with it and explore what options are available to them.
Stories offer lots of visual art opportunities.
For example, children can draw and paint pictures inspired by the story to illustrate parts of the story, or make models of scenes from the story using clay or recycled waste materials.
You can help develop children’s number concept by writing a summary of the events in a story, using a separate strip of paper for each event.
Stick these on the chalkboard in random order and then ask the children to sequence the events in the order that they occurred in the story.
Then talk about the events asking which one happened first, next and last.
Or which event came before or after another.
Let children learn about measurement by asking them to use the information in a story to work out how tall a character or creature Stories can be linked to concepts in Technology.
Ask the children to create recipes to suit a story’s characters – a giant, a pirate or a king.
Or ask them to build a model of a house made of straw or sticks, or a palace made of sweets!
Make reading for enjoyment part of your school!

Here are some ideas for using the two cut-out-andkeep picture books, The missing ball (pages 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 and 12) and When it rains (pages 9 and 10), as well as the Story Corner story, Message in a bottle (page 14).
Choose the ideas that best suit your children’s ages and interests.
The missing ball Gaps and his cousin, Sugarbean, want to play a game of soccer before sundown, but they can’t find their soccer ball!
As you read the story to your children, stop and ask questions or make comments that encourage them to look closely at the details in the story.
Here are some examples for the first part of the story.
G Page 4: Can you see the ball?
What do you think Gogo is doing?
G Page 5: What is Gogo doing now?
G Page 7: Look, I can see a bit of the ball there.
G Pages 8 and 9: Look at Sugarbean sitting on the bench.
How do you think she feels?
Why?
Discuss with your children what ball games they enjoy playing.
Play some of them together.
Then suggest that they draw a picture of themselves playing their favourite ball game in the moonlight – just like the calves in the story did.
When it rains This book describes the joy of people and nature at the return of rain.
It is written and illustrated by one of Africa’s well-known writers, Véronique Tadjo Before you read the story, ask your children if they enjoy the rain and why they think rain is important.
After you have read the story, read page 3 again and invite your children to use their hands and/or feet to make the sound of a dark cloud bursting open and the rain beginning to fall.
Can they make the sound of the rain getting heavier and heavier, and then gradually getting lighter until it stops?
Ask your children to think about what they would say to the rain if it were a person.
Suggest that they use their ideas to write a poem about rain or a letter to the rain!
Give your children large sheets of paper.
Let them paint the paper with water before painting a picture about the story.
Message in a bottle Literacy Day Chiku and her brother, Jabali, put a message in a glass bottle and then toss it into the ocean at Mombasa in Kenya.
The bottle and its message travel all the way down to Umgababa off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal where Sandile finds it.
And that is how a friendship begins!
After you have read the story, show your children a map of Africa and let them trace the bottle’s journey from Mombasa to Umgababa.
Then encourage them to draw their own maps that show the journey and all or some of the animals that came across the bottle on its way to Umgababa.
(You may want to show them pictures of the animals in the story before they Ask your children to imagine that they are going to put a message in a bottle.
What would their message say?
Suggest that your children write their messages – and don’t forget to write one too!

She really wanted to play at least one game of soccer before sunset!
But where was that ball?
Then the calves saw Mama Nguni Cow walking towards the river.
They went with her.
Perhaps the ball was there.
Perhaps someone had left it outside.
She went to look.
Ah, there it was – in the melon patch!
The top of it was peeping out of Gogo’s tin bath.
Suddenly they saw the cattle egret.
He was flapping his wings and running towards them.
“Sugarbean!
I’ve been trying to tell you that your ball is right behind you!” Cows give plenty of rich and creamy yellow eggs.

Over the past six years, the annual Puku Story Festival held in Grahamstown has been an exciting event intended to spark children’s interest in storytelling and reading in isiXhosa.
The festival has also provided an opportunity to showcase and celebrate the work of storytellers, writers and artists, especially in African languages.
This year the Puku Story Festival celebrated South African children’s author and storyteller, Gcina Mhlophe.
Gcina’s play, “Have you seen Zandile?” was translated into isiXhosa by Dr Hleze Kunju and performed twice a day by local actors in a packed auditorium.
A highlight of the festival was an exhibition of children’s literature curated by the National English Literary Museum (NELM).
There were 566 children from ten surrounding schools who visited the museum to view the exhibition, where they were also entertained by storytellers such as Basil Mills, Cebo Solombela, Mbulelo Bokwe, Madoda Ndlakuse and Babalwa Kona.
Other attractions included book launches and readings, as well as open mic sessions where learners and other local artists performed praise poetry and songs.

Day st Message in a bottle By Joanne Bloch Illustrations by Jiggs Snaddon-Wood Suddenly, he noticed something floating in the shallow water near It was late afternoon.
Chiku and her brother, Jabali, stood on the beach near their home in Mombasa.
Big green waves crashed in front of them.
“Are you ready?” asked Jabali.
“Look!” he shouted, pointing to the bottle.
It had turned a little could still see that there was a piece of paper inside it.
“What is it?” he asked excitedly.
Jabali took a deep breath, lifted his arm and flung the glass bottle far out into the sea.
It flew across the foamy waves, glinting in the sunlight.
Chiku and Jabali grinned at each other as they turned and walked home.
“How long do you think it will take?” asked Chiku.
“I don’t know!” answered her brother.
“You may have to wait a long, long time, but somebody will find it!
Just wait and see.” “Maybe it’s money!” The bottle bobbed on the water for many weeks.
Once a big fish swam right up to it.
“Hmmm,” she said.
“There’s something inside this hard bubble … it’s white with black squiggles on it.
I wonder what it is?” “No,” said their older cousin, Mpumi, peering at the bottle.
“It looks WOOSH!
Suddenly a school of tiny silver fish swam past right under her.
The big fish forgot all about the bottle.
“How lucky,” she chuckled as she swam after the silver fish, “my lunch has arrived!” On went the bottle, floating through calm water and stormy seas.
One evening, a baby shark lifted it up to see what was inside.
“Human things,” warned his father.
“Don’t eat it; it will make you sick!” Sandile pulled a face.
“BORING!” he said.
“Think about it,” said Mpumi.
“This letter may have travelled a very long way, and it could have been in the water for years!
Let’s take it home and open the seal with a knife!” The little shark dropped the bottle, and raced off to find his friend instead.
At last the bottle was open.
Mpumi pulled out the letter.
Still the bottle drifted, carried along by the ocean tides.
One afternoon, a wise old dolphin saw it in the water nearby.
“Look!” she said.
“I see “Hello,” read Mpumi.
“My name is Chiku.
I am nine years old.” Dolphins are very clever.
She knew she could read the words she saw through the glass.
But before she could try, her grandchild pushed his nose under the bottle.
“Catch!” he shouted.
A whole pod of dolphins laughed and squeaked as they passed the bottle to each other.
“Shhh!” said the others.
“I know!” shouted Sandile.
“It’s far away, up the east coast of Africa!
I read about it at school just last week!” “You said that was a boring book!” teased Sindi, but Sandile didn’t hear her.
He was too busy reading the letter over Mpumi’s shoulder.
“If you find this letter, please write back to me,” read Mpumi.
“Then there’s an email address here,” she told Sandile.
“Ask your mom if you can write to Chiku tonight.” And that was how Sandile started writing to Chiku.
After a few emails, reading and writing didn’t seem boring anymore.
“One day, I’m going to meet Chiku,” he told Sindi.
“Until then, we can send emails to each other!” And when Sandile’s family went to visit their cousins in KwaZulu-Natal again, he also wrote his own letter on a piece of paper, sealed it in a bottle and threw it into the sea.
He never got an answer, but he would have been very surprised to learn who found the bottle.
One stormy evening many months later, the waves carried the bottle all the way to the beach at Umgababa on the KwaZulu-Natal coast.
A little later, a boy named Sandile and his family arrived there for a holiday with their cousins.
The dolphins had swum all the way down the coast, and were living near a tiny island.
When the oldest dolphin saw Sandile’s bottle floating by, she was very excited.
The next morning, Sandile woke up early.
Usually, he hated getting out of bed.
“School is so boring!” he always grumbled.
“Why do we have to learn to read and write?
Playing games is much more fun!” But today was different because Sandile was on holiday and he loved the beach.
“Another one!” she said.
“This time, I’m going to read it!” She dragged the bottle onto the beach, and stored it under a big rock.
Soon he was running about on the wet sand with his younger sister and cousin.
Every day, she stares at the words she sees through the glass.
She can’t read them yet, but I’m sure she’ll work it out soon!

Edition 14 our heritage Languages play an essential role in our lives.
They are the bearers of our culture and identity.
Each language is not just a series of words.
It communicates a particular experience and understanding of the world.
Language is therefore tied to a sense of belonging, which is linked to society and its values.
For many decades Africa has been the only place in the world where most children are taught in a language that is not their own.
This places African languages at the centre of the national discussion on education.
Teaching in African languages is critical.
It can help learners to grasp concepts more easily, pass well, and support their success later in life.
But if children are going to be taught in African languages, they are going to need good quality textbooks and assessment questions in those languages too.
Improving existing materials usually means translating from English to an African language, not necessarily developing original African language materials.

Teaching in African languages is critical.
Improving existing materials usually means translating from English to an African language, not necessarily developing original African language materials.
One of the questions often debated is this: do African languages have enough terminology and vocabulary to be languages of teaching and learning all the way from preschool to the end of university studies?
Of course they do!
African languages have a wealth of knowledge in them.
If we are committed to decolonising our education system, African language users need to play a leading role in designing a curriculum that is inclusive of their languages.
Access to printed materials in all our languages is equally important in preserving and promoting African languages.
Nal’ibali promotes the use of mother language as an essential part of reading for enjoyment.
It believes that we should all be able to read and listen to stories in the languages we speak Nal’ibali is proud of how it contributes to promoting multilingualism in South Africa.

11 South African ways to become a better reader Story stars Mrs Cecilia Kabai is the Head of Department for Languages at Chief Bambata Primary School in Evaton West, Gauteng.
She is passionate about improving the reading and writing skills of children by exposing them to as many stories as possible in their home languages from a young age.
We chatted to Mrs Kabai about the importance of stories and reading in our communities.
I love working with children, so it brings me a great sense of fulfilment.
What do you enjoy most about your work?
Why do you think we have a problem with literacy in South Africa?
What languages do you read in?
Literacy is a problem because reading is not encouraged in the years before children go to school.
Young children don’t visit libraries to read for fun because libraries do not have enough books that children can relate to in their If you were the president, what is the one thing you would do to make a difference to literacy?
Young children don’t visit libraries to read for fun because libraries do not have enough books that children can relate to in their If you were the president, what is the one thing you would do to make a difference to literacy?
I would build libraries in our communities and even introduce mobile libraries where children could go and read over the weekend.
Who told you stories when you were a child?
My grandmother used to tell us stories in Setswana.
Did anyone read to you when you were a child?
My mother used to read stories to me when I was still very young.
They were mainly in English.
I read to them often because I understand that reading helps them to be good writers and speakers.
Why do you read to your children?
What languages do you read in?
I read in English and Sesotho.
Every child should read … a book every day.
My favourite place to read is … sitting under a tree or in a quiet place.
Life without stories would be … gloomy and boring.

Here are some ideas for using the two cut-out-and-keep picture books as well as the Story Corner story in this supplement, as well as some fun Heritage Month activities to grow your children’s creativity and encourage them to have fun with reading and writing.
Remember to choose the activities that are best suited to your children’s ages and interests.
After you have read Modjadji, the Rain Queen (pages 5, 6, 11 and 12), encourage your children to paint or draw pictures of Modjadji or their favourite part of the story.
If you run a reading club, you could ask the children to retell the story in their own way by acting it out.
After you have read, The rainmaker (page 14), suggest that your children create rain pictures.
They could use cotton wool for the clouds and then cut out raindrops from blue paper.
Or, they could finger paint the clouds and the rain.
They might even want to add rainbows to their pictures!
Together with your children, compare Modjadji, the Rain Queen and The rainmaker.
What are the similarities and differences between these stories?
Which things do your children like most in each story?
Encourage them to make up their own stories that include these things.
After you have read The lazy ant (pages 7 to 10), invite your children to use playdough or clay to make an ant city in which lots of ants are busily working together.
Write a review of this story and stand a chance of winning some books!
See page 13 for details.
To celebrate Heritage Month in September, share a story with your children that you were told or that someone read to you when you were a child.
Or, share the story of something that happened to you as a child.
Our languages are part of our heritage.
Talk about the poster on page 2 with your children.
Here are some questions you can ask.

It is really an essential and powerful part of learning language and developing literacy.
When you regularly read to children in their home language/s, you give them a strong language foundation that makes all learning easier.
If you don’t understand what you are reading, then you are not really reading – no matter how well you can say the words on the page!
It takes many years to learn another language well.
So, because understanding is at the heart of reading, children need to listen to stories being read in their home language/s.
They can then concentrate completely on the flow of the story instead of struggling to understand a language they don’t know properly.
You should also read some stories to children in their additional language – this helps them learn the new language.
And the more languages you have in your classroom and your school, the more resources you have to draw on!
Celebrate and use all the languages in some of these ways.
Sing songs and say rhymes in the home language/s of all the children, and then gradually introduce them in their additional language too.
Surround children with print in all their languages by making your own bilingual or multilingual posters on topics that interest them.
Or, write rhymes, songs and riddles in different languages onto large sheets of paper and display them.
Use all the languages that you can speak and read, to read aloud to the children.
If not all of the children know these languages, use another adult as an interpreter to translate for you after you have read each page.
Use a cellphone to record parents, grandparents and other caregivers telling and/or reading stories in their home language/s – then let the children listen to these stories.
Create a message wall where teachers and children can write messages to each other in the language of their choice.
Make reading for enjoyment part of your school!

However, the elders of the village took comfort in knowing that Rapula’s gift would not be lost.
They had lost a valuable member of their community.
It would be passed on to a Once upon a time in the Kgalagadi, there was a powerful old man had one of the greatest gifts in the world.
He had the power to bring the clouds close together when they were far apart.
He had the power to make it rain.
He was known all over the land as Rapula, the rainmaker.
There was a big funeral to honour the great rainmaker.
People came from the faraway parts of the Kgalagadi to be there.
They brought with them the little food and drink they had to share with everyone.
Before Rapula, the rainmaker, could be buried in the ground to rest forever, a strange thing happened – something that would show the people of the Kgalagadi who the new rainmaker would be.
The colours of the rainbow left the old rainmaker’s body and entered into a young girl named Mapula, who was Rapula’s greatgrandchild.
This was the most amazing thing anyone had ever seen, but everyone knew that it was the way that rainmakers passed on their power.
It happened very seldom because rainmakers lived for rain was a very painful process.
It happened very seldom because rainmakers lived for rain was a very painful process.
It took all the energy he had, but it also gave him joy to see his people benefit from the water falling from the clouds.
When it rained, the people would collect the water and use it for drinking and cooking.
The rivers would fill up and so the animals had water to drink.
The rain also fed the farmlands of the Kgalagadi.
Mapula was now the new rainmaker of the Kgalagadi.
For days after the funeral, the people celebrated the young girl’s new power.
They celebrated with music and food.
Everyone in the Kgalagadi brought her gifts of new clothing, flowers, special foods and other things.
After many years of making rain, Rapula, the rainmaker, became ill and his power weakened.
The land of the Kgalagadi slowly started to dry up.
The green grass and the trees started to disappear.
Although the old man kept trying, he could only make small amounts of rain.
And each time he tried, he became weaker and weaker.
It took a few days for Mapula to get used to her power, but soon they became stronger.
Now she had to use her gift properly.
If she was angry while making rain, she could create a thunderstorm or a flood.
This could destroy her entire community.
Even though the Kgalagadi had been without rain for so long, Mapula had to learn slowly how to use her power.
First, she learnt to make it rain a little by bringing small clouds together.
She practised doing this once a week.
Just like her great-grandfather, she became very tired after making the clouds rain.
At times she had to sleep for two days to regain her strength.
Soon the old man became so ill and weak that he could not make any rain at all.
When that happened, there was a great drought.
The lands dried up and the crops failed.
There was not enough food.
Animals died, plants died, and people died.
Animals died, plants died, and people died.
They still hoped that the rainmaker would get well again.
While they waited, they shared what little they had with each other and they gave the rainmaker the best food they had.
“Maybe he will get back his strength soon,” they said.
The people of the Kgalagadi were clever.
They learnt new ways to save the precious water.
They learnt how to build dams and make After many months of practise, Mapula was finally able to bring good rains to the Kgalagadi again.
Everyone celebrated the big rain with dancing and singing.
It had been many years since they had seen that much rain and they knew that the drought was finally over.
They were happy that there was a new rainmaker – a rainmaker who would make everyone’s life better.
The wise men of the village knew that all they could do now, was wait for Rapula to pass on his special power to mpho e kgolo thata mo lefatsheng.

The escape Long ago, a wicked giant stole two children and made them his slaves.
All day they cooked and cleaned and washed his smelly clothes.
The giant never locked the door, because he knew his pet crow wouldn’t let the children escape.
This bird had very sharp eyes, and it told the giant everything it saw.
Late one night, as the giant snored loudly, the children sat whispering together.
“We’ll never escape!” whispered Neo to Nunu.
“That bird will tell the giant as soon as we try!” They thought for a while.
Then Nunu said, “I know!
Let’s … Neo and Bella are each telling a story.
What do you think they could be telling stories about?

Edition 14 Make a difference!
Some people do this by making a difference at home and in their schools.
Others do it by contributing to community projects at a local or national level.
Some of us lead the way, while others work behind the scenes to make change happen.
But whatever we do and however we do it, we’re all driven by the same thing: the desire to make the world a better place – now and in the future.
Some people do this by making a difference at home and in their schools.
Make-a-Difference Day, celebrated in October each year, was established in 1992 to help encourage us to take at least one day a year to try to make a difference in the world.
But it’s also a day for us to think and plan how, in the year ahead, we can be ongoing agents of change in our own lives and the lives of others.
One of the easiest ways we can make a difference is by reading and telling stories to the children in our lives.
Sharing stories comes as naturally to human beings as eating and sleeping.
In fact, a lot of the time our brains even think in stories!
It doesn’t matter whether we are children or adults, we all tell stories about ourselves and others.
Sometimes those stories stay in our heads and sometimes we share them with the people in our lives.
We use stories to explore our lives – past and present – and to dream about our future.
Stories allow us to make sense of our own lives and to connect with family and friends.
The stories we hear and read as children help to shape us.
So in this very simple but powerful way, you can do something which benefits our children and our world.
Here are a few.
Sharing stories helps us bond with our children.
It lets them know that we think they are important enough for us to make the time to tell and read stories with them.
Stories help develop their imagination and creativity.
Stories help to develop children’s language and thinking, especially when they hear or read them in their home languages.
Stories provide children with examples of how people meet the challenges that face them.
Stories help develop their imagination and creativity.
When children are motivated, they learn more easily.
Stories have the power to change us and the way we see the world.
When we share stories with our children, stories can do the same for them.
Make-a-Difference Day is on 27 October 2018.

This supplement is available during term times in the following Tiso Blackstar newspapers: Sunday Times Express in the Western Cape; Sunday World in the Free State, Gauteng, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and North West; Daily Dispatch and The Herald in the Eastern Cape.
Access to reading material is one of the biggest barriers to getting South Africans reading.
Everyone was encouraged to bring and swap books, enjoy storytelling and read-aloud sessions, and find out more about how to read and share stories effectively with their children.
The book exchanges welcomed books of any variety – printed or handmade books for adults or children.
Those who brought books to exchange, received a special sticker which they placed on the books’ inside covers.
It is just one of the ways that Nal’ibali is supporting the circulation of books and stories in all South African languages.
During the launch week, Nal’ibali’s Literacy Mentors held public book exchange events across the country.
They also signed up to join Nal’ibali’s But you don’t have to be a celebrity to get involved!
Everyone is encouraged to hold a book exchange, and these don’t have to be great big events.
You can hold an exchange at your home, school and/or somewhere in your community.
Here are some tips to guide you.
Invite people whom you know enjoy reading books and who have books to share.
Put the venue, date, time and duration of the event on the invitation.
Allow enough time.
Two to three hours gives everyone a chance to look at and exchange books and meet new friends.
If possible, your guests should let you know if they are coming.
They should also let you know how many books they will bring, or you can suggest how many books they should bring.
(Three books is a good number!)
Have enough tables ready for your guests to put their books on.
(Or put tablecloths or blankets on the ground for everyone to put their books on.)
Leave space around the tables so that your guests can stand around and page through books while still leaving enough space for others to move around.
Ask your guests to wait until all the books have been laid out before they start choosing.
In this way everyone has a chance to find books they will enjoy.
Put out seats so that guests can sit and look at the books they’ve chosen.
If you can, have a separate table with easy-toeat snacks and something to drink.
Ask your guests to only take home as many books as they brought.
reading as you Reading aloud to the children in your class is fun for you and them, but it is also an activity which encourages children to learn to think more deeply about stories and helps them learn important reading skills.
Children need to learn certain strategies to help them make sense of the stories they read.
Here are some of these strategies and suggestions on how you can help children acquire them.
Use what you already know.
After you have read a story, ask the children, “Have you ever experienced something like what happened in the story?” Or ask them if they have seen, heard or tasted something that is mentioned in the story.
Encourage them to think about the ways in which their experiences are similar and different to the ones in the story.
Predict.
While you are reading, stop a few times and ask the children what they think will happen next.
Use the clues.
Help the children understand that sometimes things are not fully explained in a story – you have to work them out for yourself!
Show them how to look for clues that tell us more about what is happening, and/or more about a character or a place.
Use your imagination to interpret the story.
Ask the children to draw what they think an object, place, character or scene from the story looks like.
Display their drawings and ask them to tell you about them.
Check your understanding while reading.
Reread a part of the story where something unexpected or very important happens.
Ask the children to listen carefully for something important or unusual.
Let them talk about what they noticed.
Reflect on the story.
After you have finished reading a story, ask the children what their favourite part was.
Sometimes, also ask them to retell the story in their own words.
Make reading for enjoyment part of your school!

The leopard screamed in pain.
He shook his head from side to side.
His mouth was burning as if he had swallowed red hot coals.

There was no answer.

Edition 14 Everyone in South Africa who loves stories, knows the name Gcina Mhlophe!
October is the birth month of this great story warrior.
So, in this edition of the Nal’ibali Supplement, we honour her passion and commitment to telling the stories of Africa and encouraging children to be readers and writers of stories, which she has done for many decades.
“My people named me Gcinamasiko which means ‘keeper of heritage’,” explains Gcina.
“I wear this name like a blanket and I honour it with my being.” So, who better to explain the importance of stories than Gcina!
Here are her words, taken from the “Author’s Note” in her story collection, Stories of Africa.
My grandmother was the first person to tell me stories.
She encouraged my imagination to run wild, and I really believed in those laughing crocodiles and flying tortoises that she told me about.
I loved her tales about the scary amaZimzim – the man-eating ogres – and many more fantastic creatures.
Because of the way my grandmother told those stories to me, I learnt at a very young age to love language and to understand its power.
Many of the stories I tell are taken from well-known traditional tales that the people of Africa have been telling each other since the world began.
Some of these stories from my childhood I have found in stories told and written in many other parts of the world.
This is proof to me of the way in which people have always tried to make sense of life’s mysteries and used stories to explain them to each other.
Is there still room for these ancient stories in our lives today?
I say, “Yes!” Because any of these stories can be retold in different ways, so that it is possible for people of different ages and cultures to find what they need in it.
I have told this tale to audiences in different countries all over the world, and so many times I have had the response: “You know, that story has made me realise that to find the answers I am looking for in my life, I need to look deep inside myself.
I must search the depths of the ocean that is my own heart and soul.” Now what does a storyteller say to that?
Dr Nokugcina Mhlophe, we salute you!

Since 1988, Gcina has been holding storytelling workshops in libraries and schools across the country.

O tsamaile lefatshe lotlhe go anela mainane – Gcina has worked tirelessly for the past 11 years running the “Nozincwadi Mother of Books Literacy Campaign” to help make South Africa a reading nation.
Who told you stories when you were a child?
My grandmother.
When did you start telling stories and to whom did you tell them?
First I shared them with my school friends and then with the children I took care of as a nanny for a few months.
I began storytelling more seriously when I told stories in libraries and museums during a trip to the USA as an actress and director.
Where do you get the stories from?
The stories I tell are from long ago or I hear them on my international travels.
Of course, since I am a writer, I write new stories too!
Do you prefer reading fiction or non-fiction?
Both – all I need is a story that is well told.
My favourite place to read is … my bed and in airports when I travel.
What languages do you read in?
Mostly English, but also isiZulu and isiXhosa, especially poetry.

The greatest lesson that I learnt from a book or story was that … an author’s voice can jump up from the page and straight into my heart!
Some of the authors that have done this for me are Isabel Allende, Alice Walker, AC Jordan, Sindiwe Magona, Every child should read … Haroun and the Sea of Stories by When my daughter was younger, her favourite picture book was … Haroun and the Sea of Stories ka Salman Rushdie.

Gcina telling a story at the launch of Nal’ibali’s Story Bosso in 2017.
IsiZulu and English – it was such fun!
Her father read to her in German.
When I speak of Gcina, my heart gets filled with joy.
I met her in the early eighties at the Market Theatre.
Today she is my little sister, but she is an elder at the same time, because of the wisdom she possesses.
Her gift comes directly from the ancestors.
The true history of who we are, has been passed down through storytelling since centuries back.
If you listened in the way Gcina did, you would find that stories equip us with knowledge, education, preparation and warnings.
Gcina is the keeper of our traditions, our history, our pride and our future.
She is the ultimate matriarch who knows no boundaries.

The stories are beautifully illustrated by a variety of local artists.
Although this book has been available in English for some time, it is now available in all eleven official languages.
Before you begin reading, look at the front cover of the book with your children and let them comment on it.
Here are some ideas for using the two cut-out-andkeep picture books, Sun and Moon (pages 5, 6, 11 and 12) and The journey of the mother of books (pages 7, 8, 9 and 10), as well as the Story Corner story, Skycatcher (page 14).
Choose the ideas that best suit your children’s ages and interests.
Sun and Moon Sun and Moon live happily together with their children, the Stars.
Sun loves exploring the world he lives in, and one day on one of his journeys, he invites the Sea to visit his home – and that changes everything.
If you are using this story with younger children, they may enjoy it more if you tell them the story rather than reading it to them.
Suggest that your children create a miniature scene from the story in a small cardboard box or on a lid.
They could use playdough as well as recycled materials (like straws, matchboxes and bottle tops) and natural materials (like small stones and leaves) to do this.
Encourage your children to draw their favourite part of the story and to then write the words of that part of the story underneath their picture.
Ask your children to help you write the beautiful poem that Sun wrote after he had gone looking for his family and couldn’t find them.
If you run a reading club, invite the children to retell the story in their own way by acting it out in groups.
Or, suggest that the children create and act out a TV news report about one or more of the events in the story.
The journey of the mother of books This is a short, illustrated biography of the life of Gcina Mhlophe.
It begins with a poem that captures the way she inspires others to be storytellers and writers.
Before you begin reading, look at the front cover of the book with your children and let them comment on it.
You may need to explain to them that a biography is the story of someone’s life written by another person.
An autobiography is the story you write about your own life.
After you have finished reading, ask your children to think of one or two questions that they would want to ask Gcina if they met her.
Let your children use sheets of paper and string (or a stapler) to make blank books.
Then let them turn the books into autobiographies of their own lives.
One rainy day, Josh decides to make a kite.
The next day he goes outside to fly the kite with his friends.
But the wind is so strong that the kite flies away – higher and higher up into the sky!
Let your children design their own kites.
Ask them questions to help them get started – for example: What shape will you make your kite?
What materials could you use to make it?
How could you decorate it?
Have fun with your children by blowing up balloons and then letting them go.
(Don’t tie a knot at the end of the blown-up balloon.)
Watch how they fly all over the place as the air escapes!
In the story, Neo wears a hat made of newspaper.
Give your children newspaper, cellotape, scissors and string and challenge them to make an object using these materials.
Create TWO cut-out-and-keep books Sun and Moon Take out pages 5 to 12 of this supplement.
The sheet with pages 7, 8, 9 and 10 on it makes up the other book.
Use each of the sheets to make a book.
Follow the instructions below to make each book.
a) Fold the sheet in half along the black dotted line.

I will have to do something about that.
I will come and tell you when we have enlarged our house, then you and your children are all welcome to visit,” said the Sun, and he rushed off back home.
He told his family that he had invited the Sea to come and visit them.
There was so much work to be done, breaking and rebuilding the house to make it extra large – more than double its original size.

And the walls had to be much higher too, said the Sun, to hold all of the Sea’s many children.
Once they had finished the house then they got to the food preparation, cooking many pots full of every kind of food imaginable.

When everything was ready, the Sun rushed off to call the Sea.
He was so excited for her to meet his lovely wife and children.
The time is here!

The Sea had been waiting and she wasted no time.
The Sea had been waiting and she wasted no time.
She whoooooshed and whaaaaaaed over the hills and over the mountains, following the Sun further and further inland.
She was almost at the front door when the Moon looked up and saw that, even though the Sea had begun to arrive, the rest of her was still over there, as far as the Moon’s eyes could see!
Oh, the land was completely covered in the Sea’s water.

They were so curious, but the Moon listened to the excited telling – the happy way Sun described the Sea – and she hardly made a comment.
They peeped at the Sun and went back into the Sea’s body, some of them smiling shyly, others commenting how very warm the Sun’s rays were.
They even saw the Sea going back to her home at the Ocean and leaving some of her water children in new rivers and lakes.
“But I don’t know you!
“I wish you could meet them all; they are so very special,” “That would be wonderful.
Only “Uhmmm” (very quietly to herself).
On and on she went, shimmering and dancing in her own rhythm.
They throw a dark cloak over the world because they don’t want any humans watching.
The children were mesmerised.
People call it an eclipse, but it is the rare chance that Sun and Moon have to be together.
They were so curious, but the Moon listened to the excited telling – the happy way Sun described the Sea – and she hardly made a comment.

It was so hard to think up a different name for each and every one of them that Sun and Moon simply decided to call them … Stars.
“Meet my wife, Moon, and please do come inside.
The Sea kept swelling and swelling in the house and all that salty water spoilt the taste of the carefully prepared meals.
The food is all ready There was hardly a greeting from the Sea.
Soon there was no space for the Sun, the Moon or their children, the Stars – and still the Sea was not yet all there.
They moved so fast and so greedily.

Next time he might float over the forests, over long and vast stretches of land as the grass seemed to sway gently in the wind, calling to him to come and dance a little.
The Sun stood there, staring in amazement.
From time to time Sun would leave home in the morning and set off on an adventure to explore places he had never seen before.

Ask them if they can think of ways in which these rights can be explained so that all children understand them.
Let them work in groups to create a poster for each right that explains the right in one or more language, and has a picture to illustrate it.
 15 November Children’s Grief Awareness Day: Blue butterflies are the symbol for this day.
Ask the children to cut out paper butterflies and colour them blue.
Then suggest that they write a short message of hope to comfort children who might have lost a loved one.
(If some of the children are not able to write independently yet, ask them to tell you their messages and then write down the words they say.)
Create a “wall of hope” by making a display of all the butterflies or give them to children who might need them.
 16 November International Day of Tolerance: You’ll need lots of small pieces of paper for this activity – about half an A5 size!
Begin by discussing that it is important for everyone to be respected and appreciated.
Then give each child enough pieces of paper so that they have one for everyone in the club and themselves.
(If you have more than 20 children in your club, divide the children up into groups of between 10 and 15.)
Let the children write down something they like about each child – including themselves!

Ask the children to make a poster with all or some of the greetings on it, and display them to create an inclusive Illustrations by Rico It was a rainy day and Josh was sitting at the kitchen table making a kite.
He had some light strips of wood which he used to make the frame of the kite.
He also had some blue and red and green and pink tissue paper.
He covered the whole kite with blue tissue paper.
Woof!” barked Noodle.

“Yes, come!
Woof!” barked Noodle.
We’re going to fly Skycatcher!” said Josh as he “This blue paper is the kite’s face!” decided Josh.
He cut out red tissue paper to make happy smiling lips, green tissue paper for eyes, and pink tissue paper circles for cheeks.
Then he made a long kite tail out of the blue, red, green and pink paper.
So Hope and Neo and Bella and Noodle ran in a long line behind Josh, going bumpity-bump and woof!
“Yes, come!
all the way along the pavement.
When they got to the field next to some houses, Josh let out some more string and Skycatcher flew higher up into the air.
And then higher.
It glided gently over the rooftops and treetops with the blue sky around it.
Josh and Hope and Neo and Bella watched the kite and wished they were flying up in the sky with it.
“Your tail looks like the clothes dancing in the wind on Gogo’s washing line,” said Josh to the kite.
Then he wound a very long piece of string around a cardboard tube and tied the other end of the string to the frame of the kite, so that it wouldn’t fly away from him later when it was in the air.
“Woof!
Woof!” Noodle barked loudly.
He was also looking up at the kite.
“Your name is Skycatcher!” said Josh to the kite.
“Neo, do you want to try flying the kite?” asked Josh.
The next morning, Josh sat in his wheelchair outside his front door with Skycatcher in his lap.
It was the right sort of day to fly a kite.
He was waiting for Hope.
She was going to push him along the pavement as fast as she could go, so that Skycatcher could catch the wind and fly.
Soon it was just a small speck in the sky.
It whizzed round and round on the ground like a live, wild thing and it let more and more string out, so that the kite flew higher and higher.
Soon it was just a small speck in the sky.
“Here I am!” said Hope.
“I’m sorry I’m a bit late.
Is your kite ready to fly?” “Yes, I can’t wait to get it up into the sky!” said Josh.
“I’m sorry I’m a bit late.
She started to walk fast, and then to run all the way along the pavement.
The wheels went bumpity-bump, bumpity-bump, picking up speed as Hope ran.
Josh let a little bit of the string unwind from the cardboard tube he was holding.
Suddenly the kite took off!
He held it in his jaws and under his paws so that it couldn’t spin around.
Then he jumped up with his paws on Josh’s knees and passed the tube to Josh.
Finally, Skycatcher stopped flying away and stayed where it was, with its bright tail waving about in the sky below it.
Josh and Hope raced past Neo who was in his front garden playing with Bella.
He was wearing a newspaper pirate hat and he had a cardboard sword.
Bella was wearing a witch’s hat.
“You’re not a very good pirate!” said Bella, waving her magic wand.
“Woof!
Woof!” barked Noodle, but Neo wasn’t listening to him or Bella.
Neo was watching Josh and Hope coming along the pavement at full speed.
Then Bella forgot about their game too and she also watched Josh and Hope!
“Noodle, you saved our kite!” said Josh.
Noodle wagged his tail.
“Noodle, you’re such a clever dog!” said Bella.
Noodle wagged his tail.
“Can we come with you?” asked Neo.
Noodle wagged his tail.
Tighter and tighter he wound the string around the cardboard roll until Skycatcher lay still in his lap after its great adventure in the sky.
Hope turned the wheelchair around, and they all went bumpity-bump and woof!
“Woof!

Edition 14 10 reasons to tsa ditshwantsho November is International Picture Book Month – a time to celebrate those special books that capture our imagination with their carefully chosen words and beautiful illustrations.
Here are ten reasons to make picture books part of your children’s reading life!
Essential resources.
Picture books are meant to be read aloud, so this makes them the perfect reading resource for sharing stories with children.
Learning how stories work.
As we read picture books to children, we can invite them to comment on the story and ask questions about it.
This deepens their understanding of the story and also helps them to learn about the way in which stories and books work.
This knowledge makes learning to read easier.
Talk about the book.
Reading a picture book together encourages conversations about what’s happening in the story, what the characters are feeling, the meanings of words, and how what’s happening in the story might relate to your children.
Developing children’s language.
Picture books offer children a language Developing empathy.
Picture books help children to learn how to step into someone else’s shoes and to see life from a different perspective.
Developing the ability to do this takes lots of practice, and picture books provide a place to start the process.
feast!
Through the rhythm and rhyme in many of these books, children experience the sounds of our languages.
And, because picture books use fewer words than novels, the words that are chosen and how they are used, are very important.
So, the rich use of language in these books develops and extends children’s own use of language.
An invitation to join in.
The repetition of sentences or phrases in some picture books, allows children to join in by saying those words of the story, even before they are able to actually read them.
Learning about picture clues.
As you read picture books to children, they learn that the pictures help to tell the story and give clues to what the words are.
Understanding this is essential to learning to read.
Reading pictures.
In a picture book, the illustrations are as important as the text.
Reading a picture book means exploring the art in it as well.
This gives children practice at interpreting pictures.
Safe spaces to explore.
Picture books often explore challenging questions or topics.
They offer their readers opportunities to find their own answers to difficult questions, such as, “What is love?” and “Are there situations where it’s okay not to tell the truth?” break until the We will be taking a week of 13 January Join us then for mo Suitable for all ages.
Because picture books have fewer words in them than novels, people often think that they are only meant for young children.
This is not true!
Some picture books are meant to introduce very young children to stories and books.
But there are also lots of picture books that appeal to older children – and even teenagers!
These picture books have more complicated storylines or explore issues and ideas which older children can relate to.
So, picture books are perfect for children of all ages.

Bring picture book stories to life with your children by doing some of these activities together.
Write a review.
Ask your children to decide what their favourite picture book is and encourage them to think about what makes it their favourite.
Let them cut paper into heart shapes that are big enough to write on.
Then suggest that they write the title of the book and the author’s and illustrator’s names on one side of the heart.
On the other side, invite them to write a review saying why this particular book is their all-time favourite!
(You can adapt this activity for younger children, by cutting the heart shapes for them and writing down what they tell you about their favourite book.)
Act out the story.
Choose a well-loved story with exciting characters and a strong story line.
With your children, write down what each character says and let them choose who they want to be!
Provide story props, like pieces of fabric, hats, shoes or scarves and act out the story together.
Create a name book.
Do this with younger children or invite older children to make a book for a younger family member.
Write each letter of your child’s name on a separate sheet of paper.
Then let your children draw or find pictures of their favourite things for each letter of their name, for example, for the letter B: a banana, a ball and a book.
Try a new book.
Choose a picture book that none of you has read before.
Read the title together.
Then page through the book, and while looking at the pictures, tell your own story to go with them.
Afterwards, read the story that the author wrote.
How was the story you told similar and/or different to the one that the author wrote?
Have a picture-book party.
Plan to have a “We love picture books” party.
Display the heart-shaped book reviews your children wrote for everyone to read and ask your guests to bring along a few picture books.
Make some extra blank hearts so that your guests can write their own reviews if they want to.
Invite everyone to read their favourite books to each other.
(Younger children can use the pictures in a book to retell the story.)
Here are some other activities you could do at the party.
Paint new covers for or scenes from your favourite picture books.
Make finger puppets or story props to retell a story from a picture book.
Create your own picture-book stories.
Dress up as your favourite story characters.
Act out a picture-book story.
Keep the picture books that you love the most.
One day when you are an adult, you will open them up again, and how you felt as a child will come flooding back Get story active!
Here are some ideas for using the two cut-out-and-keep picture books, Frederick (pages 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 and 12) and Can you?
(pages 9 and 10), as well as the Story Corner story, The lion and the monkey (page 14).
Choose the ideas that best suit your children’s ages and interests.
A family of mice are working hard to gather what they will need for the coming winter.
But Frederick doesn’t seem to be helping and the other mice get cross with him.
However, during the long cold winter, Frederick proves that what he has to share is just as useful as the things they gathered.
After you have read the story to your children, discuss these questions or other ones that interest them.
 What food would you choose to collect for the winter and why?
 What do you think of what Frederick does and doesn’t do?
 Which of these do you think is the most important: food, words or stories?
Why do you think that?
Provide your children with playdough, bottle tops, stones, leaves, seeds, shells and sticks.
Let them use these to recreate scenes from the story.
Encourage your children to use playdough to make mice and then to use them to tell stories of their own.
Together write down ideas for what a mouse’s house might look like and have Encourage your children to make little storybooks on tiny pieces of paper for the mice in the story.
On each page of this book, the children do different fun actions that will make the reader smile!
The repetition and humour make this book highly suitable for younger children.
As you read the story, invite your children to try doing the actions.
Which ones do they enjoy doing the most?
After you have read the story, invite your children to look at the pictures again.
This time draw their attention to the cat and talk about what the cat is doing in each of the pictures.
Use paper and a stapler or string to make blank books.
Offer these to your children so that they can create their own “Can you?” or “I can …” books.
Encourage them to read their finished books to you and each other.
The lion and the monkey The lion, who has been trapped in a hunter’s pit, begs a passing monkey for help.
The monkey doesn’t trust the lion, but finally the lion persuades him to hang his tail into the pit so that the lion can pull himself out.
The problem is that once the lion is out of the pit, he won’t let go of the monkey’s tail!
The monkey knows he is in terrible danger, but a clever old woman comes to his rescue.
After you have read the story, talk to your children about the lessons they think the lion should have learnt from what happened.
Then encourage them to write a letter to the lion to remind him of these things.
Use paper plates, scissors, paper, paint and glue to create lion and monkey masks.
Use sticky tape to attach them to long sticks.
Then have fun acting out the story with your masks.

They were a happy family.

Stamp your feet Shake your body Shrug your shoulders wave wave wave And when they saw Frederick sitting there, staring at the meadow, they said, “And now, Frederick?” “I gather colours,” answered Frederick simply.
“For winter is grey.” “And the words, Frederick?” Frederick cleared his throat, waited a moment, and then, as if from a stage, he said: “Who scatters snowflakes?
Who melts the ice?

“Close your eyes again,” Frederick said.
And when he told them of the blue periwinkles, the red poppies in the yellow wheat, and the green leaves of the berry bush, they saw the colours as clearly as if they had been painted in their minds.
“Frederick, why don’t you work?” they asked.
“I do work,” said Frederick.

The lion and the monkey Illustrations by Jiggs Snaddon-Wood One day Grandpa wanted to teach us a lesson about trust and gratitude, so he told us a story about the lion and the monkey … “I know you are too smart to believe lies told by my enemies,” said the lion.
“Please, please help me.” The lion and the monkey lived in a thick jungle.
The lion roamed the jungle floor, while the monkey lived in the treetops.
One day the lion saw some meat on top of a banana leaf on the jungle floor.
“There’s a free and easy meal for me,” he thought.
In the end the monkey took pity on the lion and lowered his tail into the pit like a rope.
The lion held on to the monkey’s tail and climbed up it.
But even when he was out of the pit, the lion hung onto the monkey’s tail.
The lion moved towards the middle of the banana leaf, but as he sunk his teeth into the meat, the ground gave way beneath him.
Together with the meat and the banana leaf, he fell into a “Let me go!
Haven’t I helped you out of the deep pit as you begged me to?” the monkey asked the lion.
But the lion tightened his grip on the monkey’s tail even more, and when the monkey looked into the lion’s eyes, he saw the look of hunger.
“Please let me go!” the monkey cried.
But the lion’s grip only got tighter.
“How was the lion to have known that a free meal is not always free; that an easy meal is not always as easy as it seems?” commented Grandpa.
“How could the king of the jungle have known that a hunter had dug a deep pit and covered it with the banana leaf, then placed the meat in the middle of the leaf and covered the leaf with sand to disguise it?” Suddenly, an old woman appeared.
She was on her way to her farm when she saw the animals arguing.
She stopped and asked them why they were quarrelling.
The monkey told her how he had helped the lion out of the deep pit.
“But now he is holding onto my tail and he won’t let me go,” he complained.
The pit was that the lion could only stand upright, on his hind to climb out of the deep pit, but with each attempt the red soil claws and he sank back to the bottom of the pit.
The lion was still there at dusk when suddenly he saw a tail pass by.
The tail belonged to a monkey who had jumped over the pit.
The lion called desperately for help.
“Is this true?” the old woman asked the lion.
The lion nodded in agreement.
Then the old woman said to the monkey, “Clasp your hands and say, ‘I am about to die for my kindness.
I am about to die for my kindness.’” So the monkey did this.
The old woman then turned to the lion and said, “Clasp your paws and say, ‘Someone is about to die for his kindness.
Someone is about to die for his kindness.’” The lion raised his free front paw and repeated the old woman’s words.
“No!” said the old woman.
“I said clasp your paws, and I mean your two front paws, and then say the words.” As the lion obeyed her command and clasped his paws, the monkey escaped and ran away.
The lion chased the monkey until the monkey climbed up a nearby tree.
Crestfallen, the lion looked back at the spot where they had seen the old woman, but she was no longer there.
“What is the royal one doing in such a deep dark place?” asked the monkey looking into the pit.
“I fell in,” said the lion in a weak voice.
“I have been here all day.
Please help me.” The monkey hesitated and started to walk away, but the lion begged him again.
Then the monkey said, “I am told that all the animals that ever did you a good turn, never lived to tell the story.” Grandpa paused and looked at our faces that had suddenly lit up at the happy ending for the monkey.

But he had forgotten about the bottle – he wanted to know where his mother was!
“Where are you, Mama?” he called.
There was no answer.
“Mama!” he called a little louder.
Still no answer.
“Yes,” said Mme wa Afrika, “so put your shoes on.
We have to hurry.
We still have to walk to the bus stop.” “We’re going shopping!
We’re going shopping!” Afrika jumped up and down in front of Dintle.
His mother, Mme wa Afrika, smiled at him, and Dintle clapped her hands.
“My mother is lost!” said Afrika to Asanda.
“We were on our way to the book stall on the corner, but now she’s gone!” “I’m going to the book stall too!
I’m going to buy a storybook with the money I’ve saved.
Maybe your mama is at the book stall.

“That’s my mother’s voice,” said Afrika.

Then a lady sat sat on the other side of his mother, squashed against the window.
But he didn’t mind at all because it meant that he could look out of the window.
“Don’t forget to keep your nose in the air, like a prince!” laughed Asanda.
Then it was time to go.
“Look, Asanda!
I’m taking my book home on my head!” Afrika said, balancing his new book on his head.
“Please, may I have it?” Afrika asked his mother.
Afrika watched the lady walk away until she disappeared into the crowds of people standing in between the market stalls.
Together the children ran to the book stall, and there, right in front of it, were Mme wa Afrika and Dintle.
Mama opened her arms and Afrika ran straight into them.
“I bet I can carry things on my head too!” Afrika said to himself.
He saw an empty plastic cooldrink bottle on the ground.
He picked it up and put it on his head, but he had to hold onto it because it kept falling off.

“Stay close to me,” she told Afrika.
“This is a very busy place.” It was busy.
There were people carrying bags and pushing trolleys full of shopping.
There was also a lady with her shopping balanced on her head.
“Can you do that, Mama?” Afrika asked his mother.
“Carry things on the top of your head like that,” said Afrika.
“Of course I can.

Go ne go le batho ba ba tshwereng Feleng learns to read By Joanne Bloch  Illustrations by Anita Sent “Oh, all right,” said his brothers and sisters.
They were too hungry to fight with him.
Soon they were all busy nibbling at the drawing − all except Feleng.
First, he stared at the black squiggles and the bright pictures on the open pages of the book.
Then he climbed up into it, and began to move slowly and carefully from squiggle to squiggle.
At first, his brothers and sisters were too busy munching to notice what he was doing.
But after a while, his little sister Fifi looked up.
“What are you doing, Feleng?” she asked in her high, squeaky voice.
“Why aren’t Feleng the fishmoth loved stories.
“Mama,” he said every night, “please tell us a story.
I promise we’ll go to sleep straight afterwards.
Please, please, please!” Mama Fishmoth only knew one story, and she was a bit tired of telling it.
But Feleng and the other fishmoth children begged so much that she always gave in.
She told them about her adventures in the kitchen.
She spoke about her long journey there, and about all the big, strange things she had seen in the cupboards.
“Humans use so many things, like cups and plates and spoons,” she said.
“Humans are very strange!” The best part of the story came when Mama Fishmoth told the children about all the food she had tasted.
“There were breadcrumbs, apple peels, delicious lumps of porridge and grains of sugar behind the stove …” she said.
“Yum!” they murmured in dreamy voices.
“Yum, yum!” But soon their eyes grew huge.
She had reached the terrible part of her story – the day a human had tried to squash her.
“I ran for my life!” said Mama Fishmoth, rolling her eyes, and all the fishmoth children shivered and moaned and twitched their feelers … That meant it was time Feleng just smiled.
“You wait and see,” he said.
“I’ll tell you later.” That night, when the little fishmoths were cuddling up to their mother in the crack in the wall, Feleng started to speak.
“I know what you want!” said Mama Fishmoth.
She was in a good mood after her peaceful day alone at home.
“You want me to tell you a story.” Feleng grinned.
“Not tonight,” he said.
“Fifi, tell Mama what I did today.” When Mama Fishmoth heard how Feleng had moved along the squiggles in the book while the other children were eating, his mother was a bit worried.
“What were you doing, Feleng?” she asked.
“All children need to eat, you know.” One day, Mama Fishmoth told her children to go out for lunch.
“Feleng, you are the oldest,” she said.
“Please take good care of your sisters and brothers.” “I can eat tomorrow,” said Feleng.
“Today I did something even better – I learnt how to read!” Then he explained how he had looked from the black marks on the page to the pictures.
“I realised they were telling me something,” he said.
“After some time, I started to understand what the squiggles meant … they are letters, and letters make words.
And words make sentences, and sentences make stories.
So tonight, you can rest, Mama – tonight it’s my turn to tell YOU a story!” Fishmoths don’t eat every day, so the little fishmoths were very excited.
Impatiently they waited until the humans had left and the house was quiet.
Then one by one, they slid out of the crack in the wall where they lived.
“Follow me,” whispered Feleng.
“Do exactly what I do.” Up, up, up the leg of a huge table they slithered.
On the table were three or four open books with paper and crayons scattered about.
“Look at all this tasty food, just lying here waiting for us!” chuckled Feleng’s sister Phuti.
“It’s a good thing the human children are so messy!” With that, Feleng told his mother and brothers and sisters a story about a human child who went down to the river and met a crocodile.
“What’s a river?
What’s a crocodile?” shouted the little fishmoths.
“I don’t know,” laughed Feleng.
“I’ll have to find out tomorrow.
But the picture showed a huge, scary creature with a very big mouth.” “Yum!” said all the fishmoth children as they climbed into the spine of one of the books.
“Yum, yum!” “Like a human!” said Mama with a shudder, and all the fishmoth children shivered and moaned and twitched their feelers … That meant it was time for bed.
But suddenly, Feleng spoke.
“Don’t eat the books,” he said.
“Eat that instead.” He pointed to a crumpled up drawing.
“That will be tastier.
There’s lovely crayon on it.” setshwantsho – ntle fela le Feleng.

On 6 October 2018, Nal’ibali won third prize at the African Union’s Innovating Education in Africa Expo held in Dakar, Senegal.
And guess what?
“The supplement meets children where they’re at, with quality, fun reading material in their home languages,” added Huston.
Nal’ibali received this recognition for its bilingual Education in Africa Expo e e neng e tshwaretswe kwa The supplement is currently available in eight of South Africa’s official languages and they are printed every second week during school term time.
Teachers who receive the supplement say that the children cannot wait for “story week”.
“We’re really honoured to receive this continent-wide recognition,” says Katie Huston, Head of Research and Innovation at Nal’ibali.
“People often think that innovation has to mean new technology.
The supplement shows that something really simple can have a huge impact.” Nal’ibali’s award-winning supplement may be the answer to one of South Africa’s biggest challenges: How do we get quality, affordable reading materials into our children’s hands?
Research has shown that children’s reading ability is the thing that contributes the most to their success at school.
But in South Africa, only 17% of our schools have libraries stocked with books, and very few homes have more than ten books in them.
“In South Africa, books are expensive and very few are printed in indigenous languages,” explained Jade Jacobsohn, Managing Director of Nal’ibali.
“The supplement meets children where they’re at, with quality, fun reading material in their home languages,” added Huston.
“This is important, because having a strong foundation in their home language helps children to learn additional languages, including English, and to succeed at school.” The supplement is a result of partners working together to get reading materials to children and the adults in their lives.
It just shows that together we can give all our children the opportunity and support they need to become lifelong readers.
Organise fun book activities for break (interval) times.
Before school Encourage parents and other caregivers to read and tell stories to children on their way to school.
Before school Encourage parents and other caregivers to read and tell stories to children on their way to school.
They can enjoy stories in all eleven languages on their cellphones at www.nalibali.mobi.
Create a space for picture books where older children who arrive at school early can sit with younger children and read stories to them.
Turn at least one school assembly a month into a story-focussed one.
Arrange for a staff member to tell a story, let a group of children act one out, or ask a class to share with the rest of the school what they have been doing to develop a love of reading.
Use your school’s intercom system for regular storytelling sessions.
Teachers and older children can read or tell a story while the rest of the children enjoy listening to it in their classrooms.
Organise fun book activities for break (interval) times.
For example, have a book hunt.
Photocopy the covers of about ten of the children’s favourite books.
On the back of each photocopy, write clues that tell everyone where they need to look to find the next hidden book cover.
Then hide the book covers in different places in the playground and let the children have fun using the clues to find them all.
Start a #Get-Caught-Reading campaign.
Let the teachers on playground duty at break time use their cellphones to take photos of children they see reading during break.
Print out the photos and display them on a notice board.
Create your school’s own special “I got caught reading” stickers using self-adhesive labels and give one to each child who is photographed!
After school Make reading for enjoyment part of what children do after school too by starting a reading club at your school.

“My daughter, Oratile, always looks forward to the stories I translate, as I tell them to her every night at bedtime.
Now she tries to write stories of her own.
Here is one of them,” she explained.
Oratile’s story is about a boy called Jabulani who is playing with a lion that wants to eat him.

Certificate of achievement presented to fixing the internet 25 October 2018 Lolo fixes the internet By Kgosi Kgosi  Illustrations by Vian Oelofsen Lolo was a clever little girl who lived in the village of the Batswana people.
“So,” said the queen, “it is not just our village, but the whole world that does not have the internet.” The queen then held Lolo’s hand and said, “My child, we are looking for someone really clever to get into the royal spacecraft, travel into space and fix the satellite.” In Lolo’s village, the internet was the most important tool.
Lolo was the smartest of them all.
“So,” said the queen, “it is not just our village, but the whole world that does not have the internet.” The queen then held Lolo’s hand and said, “My child, we are looking for someone really clever to get into the royal spacecraft, travel into space and fix the satellite.” In Lolo’s village, the internet was the most important tool.
If you visited the village, you’d find school children using their computer tablets to find the information they needed to finish their schoolwork.
Many people had cars that could fly and they controlled these cars by using the internet.
People used the internet for EVERYTHING!
“Lolo,” said the king, “you are the only person for the job!
Lolo watched in amazement as every child in her school panicked.
She learnt how to fly and control the spacecraft and she learnt how to float in space.
For days, the little girl worked alongside the space crew to prepare for this special mission.
She learnt how to fly and control the spacecraft and she learnt how to float in space.
Soon Lolo was ready to fly off into space.

She had read that going into space was a dangerous thing to do, but she agreed to go.

After flying for what seemed like a long, long time, the spacecraft landed at the space station.
Lolo could see the satellite from the window.
She contacted the king and queen using a special type of radio to let them know that she had arrived safely.
She decided that the next day she would pay the king and queen a visit to find out about the problem.
When Lolo arrived at the Royal House, she was welcomed with a glass of warm milk and a plate of chocolate chip biscuits.
She knew that the success of the mission was in her hands and she didn’t want to let everyone down.
Lolo could not understand what the fuss was about.
The mission had become very difficult, but still the clever little girl kept working and working, until one day … she had worked it all out!
One of the cables on the satellite had burnt out and needed to be replaced.
The queen explained that their ministers had found out that the problem was with a satellite that was far, far away – all the way up in space!

One hot summer’s day, Gogo decided to take Neo, Bella and Mbali to the beach.
Bella didn’t want to leave Noodle at home, so he came too!
As soon as they got to the beach, Gogo put up a purple and red umbrella to give them some shade.
But Bella wasn’t interested in sitting under an umbrella – she wanted to build a sandcastle for a queen!
“Put on your new red sunhat if you’re going to play in the sun,” said Gogo.
First, Bella spent time collecting sand and seashells in her green bucket.
Then she spent time digging and building.
She didn’t stop until she had finished the sandcastle, even though it was very hot in the sun!
Neo decided that he wanted to read and so he settled down under the umbrella.
He was so busy reading that he forgot to take off his sunglasses and sandals.
“Why is it so dark at the beach today, Gogo?” he asked.
“I can hardly see the pictures in my book.” “Well, if you took off your sunglasses, it might help you see better!” laughed Gogo.
Mbali, who always copies her big brother, sat down next to Neo and started to read his book about dogs.
But being at the beach is tiring when you are two years old and it wasn’t long before she fell fast asleep with the book over her face and her teddy bear next to her on the towel.

Build your baby’s brain!
Have you ever wondered why we read to babies and toddlers?
The simple answer is that reading together is a wonderful way to get to know each other, develop your baby’s or toddler’s language and stimulate their minds to have big thoughts and ideas!
Here are some tips for reading to babies and toddlers.
Until babies can sit on their own, it’s easiest to put them on your lap with their back against you and to hold the book in front of them.
BIRTH TO 6 MONTHS 1.
First books that have simple pictures or photographs of babies’ faces, usually work well for very young babies.

Repetition and routine make young the same book over and over again in exactly the same place each day without boring your baby!
You can also say different things to what is written on the pages, as long as you and your 6 TO 12 MONTHS 1.

From about six months of age, most babies also enjoy books that have songs and rhymes in them.

How did your love for reading and storytelling start?
I would sit for hours listening to the cassette tapes and reading along with the books, even before I could actually read!
My mother also always read to me at bedtime.
Ke ne ke You are the author of Mpumi’s magic beads.
Have you always wanted to write a children’s book?
Yes, but of all my ambitions, it is the one I spoke about the least.
I grew up reading a lot, but when I became an adult, it was easier to imagine myself writing for adults, because I am one!
I admire children’s book writers.
I have always thought that writing for children is difficult – holding children’s interest is not easy.
Tell us about Mpumi’s magic beads.
I really love Johannesburg and I have always wanted to write about the city from a child’s perspective.

Literacy is a critical building block for individuals and communities.
Reading and storytelling can teach people so many things, such as how to use your imagination, how to develop the confidence to speak out and how to be more compassionate to others.
Exposing children to these lessons is important because readers become leaders, as we know.

The girls’ eyes are as big as plates!
Above, a black sky twinkles with many, many stars.
From their seats, they stare deep into space.
“There’s the solar system,” Tshiamo whispers, “the planets go around the sun.” “And the one we live on is called Earth,” adds Mpumi, “it’s full of life: a home for everyone.” Asante rubs her chin and thinks.
“There’s only one good way to find out.
Ever seen the moon and stars up close?” she winks.
“I wish us into outer space!” Mpumi shouts.
The beads jingle and jangle and sparkle.
The girls all giggle with glee.
The next thing you know, they zoom into the air and fly up into the clouds, up above the city!
The girls are safe, back at school and happy.
Mpumi, Tshiamo and Asante are the best of friends, and now they know: Joburg city is not at all boring.
The friends just can’t believe it; what an amazing, awesome surprise!
They explore the zoo; count their favourite animals and run around with the biggest of smiles.
“How did it happen?” asks Tshiamo.
Asante really has no idea.
“Aunty Tshego says my hair is special,” Mpumi offers, “so maybe that’s what brought us here.” Tshiamo says, “I’m ready for our next trip.” Asante smiles a big smile and agrees.
The girls all giggle with glee.

“I wish us onto a rollercoaster,” she screams.
In Joburg city, all dull and grey, three friends are bored at school.
It’s break time and they would like to play, but there’s no grass, no field or pool.
Their classes are in a big, concrete building with offices above and shops below, on a busy street full of people and cars, so they have no other place to go.
The girls all feel good and glad now, they stand up and get ready to go, feeling full of love and holding hands.

Tshiamo says, “Those beads look so pretty.” “Thank you,” she replies and spins around, “I was plaited by Tshego, my favourite aunty!” They admire each other’s beautiful hair; Tshiamo’s afro and Asante’s plaits are lovely.

“I wish we could have fun!” exclaims Mpumi.
Two little feet to kick.

The girls pull faces and make jokes, all to get Mpumi smiling once again.
In no time, it works as her face lights up.
See?
Nothing is too difficult when you have friends!
“This is not school.
Where are we?” Asante panics.
All three friends are scared with worry.
“Oh no, the magic beads didn’t work,” cries Mpumi.
“This is my fault.
I’m so sorry!” Mpumi sits down, covers her face and cries.
She blames herself for getting them stuck.
Tshiamo and Asante rush to give her a big hug.
“This is my fault.
They laugh and scream, “Oh, we feel so dizzy!” as they whizz and whoosh, dip and dive.
They land on the ground, all in a big heap; they stand up and dust themselves slowly.
But it isn’t the three of them only.
They see boys and girls and mamas and papas and a whole lot of wild animals too: a monkey, a lion, a bear, and a parrot that shouts, “Welcome to the Johannesburg Zoo!” “Gold Reef City is fun,” pants Asante, “but I don’t want to get into trouble – let’s leave!” They get ready to go, but then they hear a girl shout, “Mommy, her hair looks like worms covered in beads!” fitlhe go lone?” basetsana ba itshwarelela mo rollercoaster.

Eventually, it comes to a slow, slow stop and they hop off the ride together.
“Gold Reef City e monate,” garialo Asante, With tears in her eyes, Mpumi asks her friends, “Why would someone say something so mean?” Asante and Tshiamo feel sad now too because of how unhappy their best friend feels.
“I wish we could all go back,” Mpumi whispers.
She really is too upset to speak.

Creating future readers!
Have you ever wondered why people say that it is important to read to children who are not yet at school?
Well, because it will expand their minds and make their hearts sing!
Read with your 3 to 6 year olds regularly and you will witness just how much they learn and what they can do with books!
Here are some ideas for sharing books with them.
WHICH BOOKS TO CHOOSE Introduce your children to as wide a variety of books as possible.
Share books by the authors that they most enjoy, but introduce them to new authors too.
Repeat children’s favourite stories as often as they ask for them!
As they get to know the stories better, invite them to read along with you.
Suggest that they “read” (recite) repeated phrases and sentences like, “I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house down” or “Trip, trap, trip, trap”.
Set aside a special time each day when you can enjoy books together.
Choose books that you like, as well as ones that you think will be of special interest to your children.
And, of course, also make time to read the stories that your children choose themselves.
And, of course, also make time to read the stories that your children choose themselves.
Read with as much expression as you can.
You may feel a little odd about doing this in the beginning, but your children will appreciate it!
Read the title of the book and the name of the author and illustrator each time you read.
The first time you read a book with your children, also ask them if they can guess what the book might be about by simply listening to the title and looking at the illustration on the cover.
Being able to guess what comes next is a skill competent readers use all the time.
As you read a story with your children, develop their prediction skills by asking, “What do you think will happen next?” at different points in the story.
Each year on World Read Aloud Day, Nal’ibali reminds everyone who lives in South Africa about the benefits of reading aloud to children.
Deepen your children’s understanding by asking, “What does that remind you of?”, “Why do you think he did that?” and “What would you have done?” These kinds of questions connect stories to children’s lives and help them to discover how stories work – both of these are This supplement is available during term times in the following Tiso Blackstar newspapers: Sunday Times Express in the Western Cape; Sowetan in the Free State, Gauteng, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and North West; Daily Dispatch and The Herald in the Eastern Cape.
Each year on World Read Aloud Day, Nal’ibali reminds everyone who lives in South Africa about the benefits of reading aloud to children.
You’ve helped us spread a love of stories and reading to more and more children each year.
When we first started in 2013, you helped us to read to 13 401 children.
And this year on 1 February 2019, we reached 1 559 730 children across the country!
That’s a new record for Nal’ibali and South Africa!
In preparation for World Read Aloud Day we always produce a special story.
This year our story was, Where are you?, written by Ann Walton and illustrated by Rico.
In preparation for World Read Aloud Day we always produce a special story.
The story was available in all 11 official languages and appeared in our World Read Aloud Day edition of the supplement, as well as on specially designed story cards (with activity ideas and tips on reading aloud) that were given away.
Nal’ibali also partnered with Blind SA to produce a version of the story in Braille, and with Sign Language Education and Development (SLED) to make a digital video of it in South African Sign Language.
(You can still find Where are you?
on our website: www.nalibali.org.)
E tlhagisitse moanelwa yo o rategang wa “Reading a story out loud, shows children the value of books, but also starts discussions, builds bonds between the reader and the audience, and motivates children to learn to read and enjoy books beyond their current reading ability,” explained Jade Jacobsohn, Managing Director of The Nal’ibali Trust.
The promotion of World Read Aloud Day began early this year!
In the week of 21 January 2019, volunteers together with mascots of some of the Nal’ibali characters, took to the streets in various communities to hand out story cards.
The day’s events got going with a few songs and games.
Over 200 children joined Nal’ibali at the Sandton Library to celebrate World Read Aloud Day.
Lebohang Masango read the story aloud to everyone.
Nal’ibali character, Neo, also joined in the fun.
Then on 1 February, Nal’ibali’s network of partners, schools that are part of our Story Powered Schools project, our Literacy Mentors and FUNda Leaders read the story to children at reading clubs, schools, libraries and community centres across the country.
In addition to this, a special event with 200 children from Soweto and Alexandra was held at the Sandton Library in Gauteng.
The 2019 Nal’ibali World Read Aloud Day of Where are you?
and spoke to the children and accompanying adults about the importance of reading aloud.
“Reading to your children is important because the benefits will follow them for their entire lives.
Not only is it great for bonding, but you are also expanding their vocabulary, their knowledge, their imaginations and their ability to confidently express their ideas.
Reading is truly the gift that keeps on giving!” she explained.
Everyone had lots of fun singing songs, playing games and listening to the story.
Then it was time to go home.
And no one went home empty handed!
In addition to a packet of snacks and a copy of the World Read Aloud Day story card, each child received a copy of Lebohang Masango’s book, Mpumi’s magic beads, to encourage them to keep reading.
It was another fun and inspiring World Read Aloud Day!
There was enough time for the children to explore the books in the library.
Everyone went home with lots to read!
FENYA!

We chatted to her to find out more about her role as a reading activist.
How did your love for reading and storytelling start?
My first memory of being read to was at the age of 6.
I also remember sitting in a neighbour’s yard and listening to her tell the most wonderful stories – they were full of character and colour.
Now, at almost 50 years old, stories are part of my everyday life.
That just shows you how a small but incredible moment can create a love of reading.
(You can read this story in 11 languages if you look under “Multilingual stories” on the Nal’ibali website my daughter’s class at school made me realise that I have a special something, which I wanted to share.
What inspired you to be a storyteller?
We pass on a little bit of history and of ourselves each time we share a story.
Reading to children encourages them to, one day, hold that book and read it for themselves.
It was Nal’ibali’s Neo and the big, wide world.

Between the ages of six and nine, most children learn to read for themselves.
So, what can you do to help them develop as readers?
Well, the most important thing you can do is to keep reading to them!
Here are some ideas for doing that.
WHICH BOOKS TO CHOOSE 1.
Let your children select books that appeal to them.
Children very often find an author, a type of story or a series they like, and this might inspire them to read Talk about stories Help your children make connections between the things they are reading about, and real life.
For example, if they are reading about school, link it to their own experience of school.
Extend stories by asking your children to think about why characters behaved in certain ways, and what your children might have done if they were in the same situation.
2.
As they start to read on their own, help your children choose books that are not too difficult so that they are able to have lots of successful reading experiences.
3.
Keep more difficult books for you to read to your children.
4.
Expose older children to longer books with chapters.
Try to read a chapter or two each day.
More tips  Sing songs, say tongue twisters (such as: red lorry, yellow lorry) and read rhymes together to get children used to the different sounds in words.
This helps them master the skills they need for their own reading and writing.
 Create some opportunities for your children to read to you.
For example, once a week take turns reading aloud to each other just before bedtime.
Or, suggest that they try out their new skills by reading to younger siblings.
This helps children to feel proud of what they can do.
 Don’t let your children leave home without a book.
Encourage them to read everywhere – even in the car or taxi!
 Read the stories your children ask for again and again, but also encourage them to read their favourite stories again themselves.
This helps them to become more  Remember that the most important thing is to make reading a relaxed, meaningful and satisfying experience.

The month of May is filled with special opportunities for children to use reading and writing in meaningful and fun ways!
Here are some ideas for the different celebrations this month.
Rather than trying to do all of them, choose one or two that you think will most interest your children.
Mother’s Day (12 May) Invite the mothers of the children at your reading club (or people who are like mothers to them) to join you at the reading club session which is closest to Mother’s Day.
Read or tell a story about a mother–child relationship to everyone and then invite the mothers and their children to spend time reading stories and looking at books together.
Instead of giving cards to their mothers, suggest that the children follow the steps below to create special Mother’s Day messages for their moms!

International Day of Families (15 May) and Biographer’s Explain that a biography is a book written by an author about someone else’s life.
Encourage the children to choose a member of their family to write a biography about.
Before they start writing, suggest that they do some research by talking to people who know this person.
Give your children some sheets of blank paper and challenge them to create a storybook by drawing pictures only!
They will need to write the title of the story and their names on the front cover, but the rest of their book should be only the pictures they have drawn.
Invite them to share their finished story with you!

It provides aspiring storytellers with an opportunity to showcase their talent and it promotes storytelling in all official South African languages.
The Story Bosso theme for 2018 was, South African Heroes.
“Heroes show us how to live our lives.
They give us hope and motivate us to overcome challenges.
By remembering and telling the stories of our heroes, we aim to inspire greatness in South Africa’s children,” explained Jade Jacobsohn, Managing Director of The Nal’ibali Trust.

Storytelling is an important part of our heritage.
It also plays a key role in children’s literacy development by encouraging the use of their imagination, curiosity and empathy.
More than 50 Story Bosso storytelling events were held across the country during September 2018 to allow members of the public to practise and build their storytelling skills before entering the contest.
The winner, thirteen-year-old Praises Banda from Ga-Kibi, Dankie Village, in Limpopo, was selected from over two thousand entries.
A further five provincial winners were also selected, namely: Thabiso Khoeli from Free State, Sibongile Mofokeng from Gauteng, Afika Cwecwe from Eastern Cape, Mandisa Madlala from KwaZulu-Natal and Mbalentle Mangete from Western Cape.
Go feta fa go tlhophilwe bafenyi ba diporofense ba le tlhano, e bong: Thabiso Khoeli go tswa “We were blown away by Praises Banda who told her story so skilfully in her home language, Sepedi,” said Jacobsohn.
Told with both sadness and passion, Praises’ story was about her personal hero, Kholofelo Sasebola, who put an end to the bullying she endured at school.
“You could hear the sadness in Praises’ voice.
You could tell the bullying was traumatic, but, at the same time, you could hear her passion for celebrating the deed of her hero.
Her command of Sepedi is commendable.
Though the story was told in simple sentences, Praises used the language playfully,” commented Lorato Trok, one of the Story Bosso judges.
“We know that well-told stories can inspire children to explore stories in books too, and sharing stories with children helps to root the seeds of a reading culture in daily life.
We are proud of all of our winners for showing us what good storytelling is,” concluded Jacobsohn.

Mama laid baby Bongi down on a towel.

She sent Thoko off to fill a bowl with warm water to wipe baby Bongi’s bottom clean.
“Powder, please,” asked Mama.
And Thoko handed her the baby powder.
“Clean nappy, please,” asked Mama.
And Thoko handed her a clean nappy.
“There!” said Mama.
“Powder bum!
Now he’s happy!” Mama picked up baby Bongi and looked at Thoko.
“Would you like to hold him?” asked Mama.
“No way,” said Thoko, “I’ve got lots to do.” First, Thoko did her washing.
Then she pegged Nichelle’s ballgown on the line.
Next, she opened her box of beads, but before she could thread one … Mama said, “Thoko, will you pleeease help me!
Baby Bongi needs a song.” So, Gogo switched off the TV.
And Mama showed Thoko how to hold baby Bongi safely on Go to sleep baby boy!” After a while, Mama took sleepy baby Bongi from Thoko and settled him back in his buggy.
Gogo went on watching TV.
And Thoko went to check if Nichelle’s dress was drying on the line.
It was dry, so she dressed Nichelle.
“WHE!
WHE!

So, Mama fed him and sat him on the floor between puffy pillows.

It was a Saturday morning when baby Bongi arrived.
“Aunty Xoliswa has to be at the morning market to sell her necklaces, so I’ve offered to babysit,” Mama explained “Why can’t Aunty Xoliswa take her baby with her?” asked Thoko, who had plans of her own.
“Because if he cries, I can’t see to my customers,” explained Aunty Xoliswa.
“It will be fun to have a baby in the house,” said Mama.
“But babies cry all the time,” said Thoko.
“Oh, I remember when you were a baby,” said Gogo.
“It was whe, whe, whe all the time!” And the minute Aunty Xoliswa left, that’s exactly what She had walked far from Mother Goat.
Mother Goat wondered where Little Goat had gone.

By the time Aunty Xoliswa returned, Thoko was very, very tired from playing with baby Bongi.
“Here’s a ‘thank you’ present for being such a sweet babysitter,” said Aunty Xoliswa as she tied one of her beautiful beaded necklaces around Thoko’s neck.
“Thank you,” said Thoko, with a BIG yawn.
Mama looked at Gogo and said, “Oh dear, Thoko is too tired to come shopping with us today.” Yebo!
Thoko’s eyes had started to close.
Gogo giggled.
“Eish!

The tale of Oxpecker and Buffalo In the old days, Oxpecker had a bright yellow bill.
He lived in a little hut in a “How are you going to stop me?
Look at how big I am.
And because you’re patch of long grass.
Each day he would sweep his hut before setting off into being so rude, I’ve decided that I’m going to eat and eat and eat until I’m full.” the grass to catch his favourite food.
At night he would climb into his nest- And with a loud MUNCH!
CRUNCH!
Buffalo started to eat.
bed, his belly full of green grasshoppers, flies and wriggly worms.
This made Oxpecker so angry that the end of his beak turned bright red.
If anyone came into the patch of long grass, Oxpecker would fly up and shout Oxpecker flew around Buffalo’s head shouting and shrieking and whooping, at them.
He would peck them and make a fuss until they went away.
He liked but Buffalo just kept on eating.
Soon all the long grass was gone.
To to live alone, and he didn’t want to share with anyone.
make matters worse, Buffalo put his big hoof right through the roof of One day, while Oxpecker was out searching for insects, he heard a low Oxpecker flew up onto Buffalo’s back and started pecking away at his skin.
rumble, like the sound of thunder rolling in the hills, and something blocked out the sun.
“That’s not going to work,” said Buffalo.
“My skin is very thick.
Even Lion “What now?” shrieked Oxpecker, flying up out of the long grass to get a has tried to bite me with his sharp teeth and I got away.
You are too small, Oxpecker.
And you deserved what you got.
I was willing to share.” A big, black animal with heavy horns was walking through the long grass.
“Well, that’s it then,” said Oxpecker growing suddenly quiet.
“I was only angry and rude because that was my home.
Now I have no home and no food – all those delicious green grasshoppers, flies and wriggly worms that lived in the long grass are gone!
Everything’s gone.” Buffalo looked back at Oxpecker, who was crying, and then to the bare patch of earth and the broken hut.
“I’m sorry I destroyed your home,” he said, “but maybe I can make it up to you.
I have a problem with insects, you see.
I mean, just take a look at my back.
There are always far too many insects hanging on and crawling all over me.
You could eat them, and it would be really nice to have someone finally get rid of them for me.” Oxpecker looked up and down Buffalo’s body and noticed all the little insects clinging to Buffalo’s skin.
The bird’s tummy rumbled, but the thought of doing Buffalo a favour after everything he had done, made Oxpecker angrier and angrier.
His yellow bill grew redder and redder.
“First you ate all my lovely grass!” shouted Oxpecker.
“Then you wrecked my house.
You actually put your big hoof right through the roof!
Now you want me to eat all these insects as a favour!” He walked up and down Buffalo’s back, “Hello,” said Buffalo.
“I haven’t eaten anything in weeks.
This long grass is pecking at the insects as he talked.
“You really are the worst, Buffalo!
As if I exactly what I need.
May I have some?” would help you,” he said with his little mouth full of insects.
“No!
Go away!” shouted Oxpecker.
“Well, I’ll die if I don’t eat something.
There hasn’t been any rain for months.
This is the only patch of long grass around here.
Won’t you let me eat some of it, please?” “Didn’t you hear me?
Go away!” said Oxpecker flying around Buffalo’s head.
“But you don’t even eat grass,” Buffalo said.
And then he tried again, “We could share the grass.” “I don’t share!
This is mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Now go away!” shouted Oxpecker.
Buffalo’s forehead wrinkled and his eyes narrowed to slits.
He got so angry that his tail swished back and forth, making a loud clapping sound as it struck the sides of his rump.
“Well, if you are going to be rude, I’m going to eat it anyway.
I eat grass, that is what I do, and I am hungry, so here I GO, you rude bird,” said Buffalo about to chomp on some grass.
Buffalo simply shrugged and walked off with Oxpecker riding on his back, shouting and eating insects.
And they are still doing that to this day, but “You wouldn’t dare!” shrieked Oxpecker.
Oxpecker never forgave Buffalo, and his yellow beak stayed red forever.

Remember to share different types of reading material with your children, such as magazine articles, poems, newspaper articles as well as interesting material on the internet.
Getting young children into the habit of reading is sometimes easier than keeping them reading as they get older!
So, what can you do to make sure that your children keep reading throughout their childhood and into their teenage years?
Some children like adventure stories; others like science fiction.
We will be taking a break until the week of 19 July 2019.
Once you are used to reading together regularly, introduce short chapter books.
Join us then for more Nal’ibali If you have been sharing books with your children since they were babies, then often by the age of 9, they like certain types of books.
Some children like stories about characters in real-life situations; others like fantasy.
Some children like adventure stories; others like science fiction.
In fact, it’s part of becoming a more mature reader.
So, don’t worry if your children only want to read one or two types of books!
Here are some ideas.
Remember to share different types of reading material with your children, such as magazine articles, poems, newspaper articles as well as interesting material on the internet.
Tota, se ke karolo How to encourage readers If your children are aged 9 or older, and they are not yet able to read independently, try choosing picture books to read to them to start with.
Books with traditional stories often have illustrations in them which make them suitable for late-starters or children who find reading difficult.
Once you are used to reading together regularly, introduce short chapter books.
Once you are used to reading together regularly, introduce short chapter books.
These often Some teenagers can’t get enough of books and always seem to have their nose in a book, while others often go through phases of hardly reading at all.
Encourage less-regular readers by buying magazines for them, leaving a newspaper lying around, suggesting they visit websites with interesting content, and visiting the library or popping into a bookshop when they just happen to be with you!
If you have friends with children of the same age as your children, then find out what their children are reading and suggest these books to your children.
Spend some time each day reading to your children – even if they are good readers themselves.
Choose books that are slightly more difficult than the ones that they are able to read on their own.
Choose a book to read together and take turns reading two or three chapters to each other every day until it is finished.
Celebrate Africa Day!
Africa Day is celebrated on 25 May each year.
It is the day on which we celebrate the start of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963, as well as the freedom fought for by African countries.
The OAU was replaced by the African Union (AU) in 2001.
The African Union works to bring unity and peace to Africa.
Africa Day is a public holiday in only five African countries: Ghana, Mali, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
But, it is celebrated all over Africa, as well as by Africans living in other parts of the world!
Here are some ideas of how you can celebrate Africa Day.
Enjoy our special Africa Day focus in the story, Auntie Boi’s gift (pages 7 to 10), and in “Nal’ibali fun” on page 16.
Tell or read a traditional African story.
Encourage your children to make a “Children of Africa” poster with their friends.
They will need a large sheet of paper or cardboard, smaller pieces of paper or photographs, glue, scissors, kokis and/or pencil crayons.
Let them start by finding photographs of themselves or drawing pictures of themselves on small pieces of paper.
Next, they should arrange the photographs or pictures on a large sheet of paper so that there is space to write under or next to each photograph/picture.
After they have pasted down the pictures or photographs, let them take turns writing a few interesting facts about each other.
We are all Africans and together our memories create the story of Africa!
Make your own memory cards to capture your stories.
You will need pieces of cardboard that are about the size of a quarter of an A4 page, sheets of paper the same size, pencil crayons or crayons, scissors and glue.
Start by spending some quiet time in which you each think of a memory that is special and important to you.
Now think about six to eight moments in that memory that will help you tell the story of that memory.
Draw a picture on a sheet of paper for each of these moments.
Paste the pictures on the cardboard to create memory cards.
Let everyone have a turn to show their memory cards one at a time as they tell the story of their memory.

When children are a bit older, they often use the letters of the alphabet to make up the sounds in words they know, but are not able to spell correctly yet.
Learning to write – just like learning to read – happens over time.
It’s a journey – and your children sound like they are well on their way already.
Enjoy the journey together!

“Good idea,” he said softly, running his tongue slowly over his yellow, pointed teeth.
Then he turned and waddled back into the river.
Soon the water was churning, as a long row of crocodiles began lining up behind him in the river.
The crocodile king could hardly believe his luck.
He imagined the delicious feast he would have as soon as it was his turn to do the counting.
“Well,” said Haruki boldly, not looking at all frightened, “I think it’s time for us kings to compare our kingdoms.
First I will count all the crocodiles, and then you can count all the hares.
It’s not fair that we can’t go there!” As long as the little hares listened to their mothers, they led perfectly happy lives, hopping about under the trees and gobbling the grasses and flowers that grew all around them.
At that time, all the hares lived on an island, separated from the mainland by a wide, foaming river.
Though the hares knew how to swim, they could never reach the mainland, because in this river lived dozens and dozens of big, green, hungry crocodiles.
These crocodiles loved nothing more than delicious hare for breakfast, lunch and supper.
So every day all the mother hares told their little ones, “KEEP AWAY from the sandy banks!
KEEP AWAY from the water!
KEEP AWAY from those terrifying, hungry crocodiles!” tsamaye e fitlhe kwa lefatsheng, gonne mo nokeng e go ne go nna “Go tshwanetse ga bo go le monate tota kwa lefatsheng!” “It must be so exciting on the mainland!” they said to each other.
“There must be wonderful things to eat there, and lots and lots of interesting animals to play with.
It’s not fair that we can’t go there!” As long as the little hares listened to their mothers, they led perfectly happy lives, hopping about under the trees and gobbling the grasses and flowers that grew all around them.
But when the hares grew bigger, some of them longed for a life of adventure.
“Here I go!” said Haruki, grinning at his friends.
He bounded onto the back of the first crocodile, wagging his tail as he began to count.
His friends gasped in amazement as they saw what he was doing.
“One!
Two!
Three!” he counted loudly, leaping from one spiny crocodile back to the next.
“One!
Five!
Six!
Seven!” he carried on, wagging his long, white tail wildly as he jumped closer and closer to the mainland.
After ten minutes, his friends could only see a little speck, shouting and jumping in the distance.

“Domino doesn’t scratch me, or drink my milk and he never walks on my schoolbooks with muddy paws.” The children shut the animals in the yard and off they went to church.
“You children won’t be getting any chocolate after church today.
Now put the animals in the yard and let’s go to church,” she said.
By Helen Brain  Illustrations by Jiggs Snaddon-Wood Vusi loved his dog, Domino.
Domino was white with three black spots on his back.
Vusi’s little sister, Sinazo, loved her cat, Fluffy.
Fluffy was black with three white spots on her tummy.
Now put the animals in the yard and let’s go to church,” she said.
Domino went to sleep in the sun, but Fluffy climbed onto the roof of the house so that she could see far and wide.
Suddenly she heard a soft, squeaky noise.
Someone was trying to open the gate into Granny’s vegetable garden!
Fluffy looked over the edge of the roof and saw a bad man stealing Granny’s mealies!
“My dog is better than your cat,” said Vusi one Sunday morning as the children were having breakfast.
“Domino doesn’t scratch me, or drink my milk and he never walks on my schoolbooks with muddy paws.” The children shut the animals in the yard and off they went to church.
“When you tell him to sit, he jumps around.
When you tell him to jump, he sits down, and when you sit down, he jumps up and licks your face!” “Hooooowwwwatcha!” Fluffy screeched, jumping right onto the man’s head.
“Get off!” screamed the thief.
“My cat is better than your dog,” said Sinazo.
“Fluffy does not lick my face nor steal my ice cream.
Fluffy doesn’t make a mess in the yard and she The noise woke up Domino.
He came bounding around the corner.
“Woof!
“Woof!
Get out!” he barked.
“Get away from me!” yelled the thief.
He jumped over the fence, but Domino was waiting for him.
Domino grabbed the thief’s trousers.
He pulled and pulled, and growled and growled, and shook and shook.
The thief was terrified.
“Let go!” he screamed, but then, RRRRRRIIIPPP!
The thief’s trousers tore right off.
He ran away − up the hill, past the church and all the way home.
Just then Vusi, Sinazo and Granny came out of church.
They laughed when they saw a man running by with no trousers on.
Then they saw Domino running after him with the man’s trousers in his teeth.
“No need to fight,” Granny told Vusi and Sinazo.
“Now finish your breakfast and put Domino and Fluffy in the yard.
Then wash your face, brush your teeth, comb your hair and put on your clothes for church.” Vusi took Domino into the yard.
“Stay here,” he said.
Vusi ran back inside, but he forgot to shut the kitchen door.
Domino followed him right back inside and quickly hid under Vusi’s bed.
Sinazo took Fluffy into the yard.
“Stay here,” he said.
Sinazo ran back inside, but she forgot to shut the bedroom window.
Fluffy went right back inside.
She jumped on top of the wardrobe and went to sleep.
The children washed their faces, brushed their teeth and combed their hair.
Then they went into their bedroom to get dressed.
Sinazo was trying to reach her dress in the wardrobe.
“Woof, woof, this is fun,” barked Domino.
He jumped up and licked Sinazo with his long red tongue.
“Go away, Domino!” she shouted.
“Get off her, or I will scratch you.” “You are both very good animals,” said Granny when they got home.
“You saved my vegetables from that thief.” Just then Granny came marching down the passage.
“Ssssss!” she hissed.
“It is almost time to leave.” “Does that mean we get chocolate after all?” asked Vusi.
At that exact moment Fluffy leaped off the wardrobe and landed on Granny’s head.
“What is going on in here?” she asked sternly, opening the door.
“Yes,” said Granny.
She bought them each a bar of peppermint chocolate.
Then she bought a juicy bone for Domino and a tin of tasty fish for Fluffy.
The thief was so shy because everyone had seen him without his trousers on that he ran away to another town, and was never seen again.
At that exact moment Fluffy leaped off the wardrobe and landed on Granny’s head.

Tips for reading stories Reading stories to children is a great bonding as well as educational activity.
But did you know that there are other simple things you can do that help increase what children learn from the stories you share with them?
Here are some activity ideas.
Try out one at a time.
See which ones work best for you and your children.
As you read, develop your children’s prediction skills by asking, “What do you think will happen next?” at some parts of the story.
Encourage children to express their feelings and get them thinking and problem solving by asking questions like, “How would you feel if that were you?”, “Do you think that was the right thing to say/do?” and “What would you have said/done if it were you?” Ask your children to look closely at particular details in the pictures.
Let them count, describe, identify or interpret what they see in the pictures.

Fa e le gore ba batla go thala setshwantsho se se farologaneng le Together sing a song or say a rhyme linked to the story.
Encourage your children to review the story by asking them what they liked about it and if there is anything they wished was different.
Invite children to draw a picture of the part of the story they liked the best.
If they want to draw something that moves away from the storyline, like a new ending, or if they want to draw themselves as characters, encourage this too!
Act out the story – or part of it – together.
Or, just dress up and pretend to be the story characters for an hour or two!
Get your children writing!
Let them write a letter to one of the characters.
Or, suggest that they write a story of their own that is inspired by the story you have read.
Do you need more advice on reading aloud to children?
You can find lots of ideas and guidance in our “How to guides” in the “Storytelling” section of the Nal’ibali website – www.nalibali.org.

Nal’ibali has teamed up with Clowns Without Borders South Africa to put on a series of free literacy-focused shows at libraries in the Eastern These shows – running from March to October 2019 – aim to encourage communities to see their local libraries as exciting places for people of all ages.
Nal’ibali e dirisana le Clowns Without Borders South Clowns Without Borders South Africa uses creative ways to raise awareness around social development issues and to spread joy.
To date, it has reached nearly half a million children and their caregivers.
When talking about the importance of getting children and adults excited about libraries, Suzan Eriksson, the Development Director at Clowns Without Borders, says, “Our experience shows us that the performing arts can be used to mobilise children and families in very effective ways.” Clowns Without Borders South Africa e dirisa ditsela tsa boitlhamedi go lemosa Eriksson, Mokaedi wa Tlhabololo kwa Clowns Without Borders, a re, “Maitemogelo The shows encourage families to visit their local libraries, to borrow books responsibly and to sign up for library cards.
As part of this initiative, Nal’ibali is offering free training and resources to librarians who are interested in running reading clubs at their libraries.
“Children need safe, welcoming spaces where they can make choices about the kinds of stories they want to explore, and Nal’ibali is committed to helping them do this,” says Jade Jacobsohn, Managing Director of The Nal’ibali Trust.
“We want people to discover storytelling in exciting, meaningful ways.” Libraries have a vital role to play in bringing about a reading revolution in South Africa.
Research shows that children who read for pleasure, do better at school.
But books are an expensive and scarce resource in our country.
Libraries offer children and adults reading material for free – and you can visit them as often as you like!

The worst birthday ever By Zukiswa Wanner  Illustrations by Magriet Brink “That’s better.
Now go and change,” she says.
I see Santie smiling and pulling her tongue at me behind my mum’s back.
I wish I could pinch her.
She is so annoying.
Hi, my name is Thando.
That’s isiZulu for love.
My mama says it is because she loves me so much.
I live with my mum, my cousin Santie, and my aunt Sallie.
Santie and her mum just moved into our place two weeks ago.
Auntie Sallie is my mum’s younger sister.
This is the first time I have met her because I overheard Gogo saying her husband did not want her to visit us.
They used to live in Mpumalanga before moving to Johannesburg to stay with us.
Mum so they had to come and stay with us.
She never told me what the domestic We finish dressing up.
I really hate this dress, and my mum says, “Let’s go girls.” We follow her.
When we get in the taxi to go to the movies, the taxi driver says, “What beautiful daughters you have, Madam.” So I smile although I know I am better looking than Santie.
But then I get upset because he asks my mother, “Are they twins?” And just as I am about to say no, we are just cousins, my mum says, “No, they are just sisters.” She is not my sister.
She is my cousin!
We get to the movies and I hope I do not see anyone I know from my school.
And then it happens.
As we are waiting for my mum to buy tickets, I see this cute boy that I like in my class.
Siya is walking with his best friend Sam and also going into the movies.
Santie is the same age as me.
Well, no actually, I am four months older.
He says to me, “Well hello, Thando, aren’t you too old to be dressed in matching outfits?” “Three months and twenty days!” Santie yells out.
You see what I mean?
I wish the floor could just open up and swallow me.
“That’s four months either way, silly,” I say.
“What’s that to you?
You are just a stupid boy who does not know fashion!” Santie answers.
“No, it isn’t!” she answers back.
As you can see Santie is very argumentative.
I do not know why she likes to argue.
It’s not even her house.
So, as I was saying, and I need to whisper this so she doesn’t interrupt, “I am four months older than her.” OMG, why did she do that?
“Yes, whatever, Thando’s ‘twin’,” he says and both he and Sam high five each other and start laughing while Today is Santie’s 11th birthday.
My mum says she is going to make it special.
Auntie Sallie will be working this evening.
She just started waiting on tables at a restaurant in Sandton and could not get a night off.
So my mum is taking us to the movies to watch Jock of the Bushveld.
I nudge Santie and say, “What is wrong with you?
Why did you have to do that?” I hope it will be fun.
We cannot wait.
Or rather, I cannot wait.
Today has not been fun so far.
Anytime I want to play a game and Santie wants to play something else, we have to do what she wants.
My mum says I have to play what Santie wants because it is her birthday.
I have tried to suggest playing something else, but Santie always screams so that my mum can hear, “But it’s my birthday!” I hope next time she has a birthday, she is not here.
“He was being mean to you.
I was just helping you,” she answers.
“Thanks a lot!
I did not ask for your help.
Siya is the cutest guy in my class and now I will be the class After we have had a bath and it is almost time to go to the movies, Mum says she has a present for Santie and me.
She has bought us dresses and shoes to wear to the movies.
She says it is so that we can look like ladies.
That is so lame.
Like, why didn’t she buy us jeans or something?
Santie’s dress is like mine, but it is red and mine is yellow.
Then we both have the same pair of shoes except her pair is red and mine is “Is he your boyfriend?” she says rolling her eyes.
“Of course not,” I say.
I wish he was my boyfriend, but now he will never be, thanks to her big mouth.
seven!” I say to Mum because I am embarrassed at the matching outfits.

It is at that moment that my mum comes back and asks Santie, “What’s that, Sweetie?” And Santie says, “Nothing, Auntie.
Thando and I were just joking.” “Wena, Thando, is that a way to say thank you?
I will take that dress back to the shop and you will not go to the movies with us.
Why can’t you be polite like Santie and just say thank you?” And my mum says, “Okay,” and hands each of us a box of popcorn, a soda and “Thank you so much, Auntie, this is the best birthday ever,” Santie says kissing my My mum smiles and says, “Oh darling, it’s nothing.
I promise to make next year my breath.
Kill me now.
This is the worst birthday ever.
And it is not even my birthday.
Also, Santie is going to be here next year?
When I grow up I want to be a documentary film maker.
I am not sure exactly what they do, but a woman who came to our school said that she was one, and it sounded very cool.

Are you a read-aloud family?
Is your family a read-aloud family?
In a read-aloud family, the adults make reading to their children for at least 15 minutes a day part of their daily routine.
Why?
Because reading aloud to children is the most important thing adults can do to develop children’s literacy!
When we start reading aloud to children every day from birth, we prepare them for lifelong learning success.
And when we keep reading to them – even when they can read for themselves – we continue to build on the solid foundation we have laid.
Every time we read to children, we improve their learning advantage.
3 WAYS TO READ ALOUD Read the pictures.

August is Women’s Month in South Africa and we’re celebrating women in this edition of the Nal’ibali Supplement!
Here’s what you’ll find inside: How our story star, Mpumy Ndlovu, is making a difference in children’s lives (page 2).
Ideas on how to use reading, writing and drawing to celebrate Women’s Month (page 4).
A story about a strong woman – Miss Helen’s magical world (starting on page 5).
Storyteller and TV actress, Mpumy Ndlovu, is a FUNda Leader.
She is committed to changing children’s lives through theatre and literacy.
We spoke to her about how she is doing this.
Where did you grow up?
I was born and bred in the township of Umlazi in KwaZulu-Natal.
It is the fourth largest township in South Africa, and the only township with its own car registration plate: NUZ!
Tell us more about your passion for children.
Tell us more about your passion for children.
Life in Umlazi is not easy.
A high rate of AIDS-related deaths has led to many children being orphaned and having to be the head of their homes.
These children often have to drop out of school and search for jobs to support themselves and their siblings.
A shared love of the performing arts, reading and storytelling has helped keep the young people of Umlazi connected.
I believe in the power of these things to uplift children.
Story stars What should childhood be like?
A child’s place is on the playground, where they can play, explore and enjoy their childhood.
Tell us more about your passion for children.
I believe that “your child is my child”.
We are all responsible for the children around us.
We need to become one big family working together to raise all our children.
And all children deserve equal opportunities.
No one’s future should be determined by their background or where they were born.
Every child should be allowed to dream because there is always potential for those dreams to come true, especially with community support.
How are you making a difference in children’s lives?
In 2009, the young people of Umlazi set up a non-profit organisation which focuses on the performing arts and is dedicated to the children of our community.
We started a project – Dlala Mntwana (isiZulu for “Play, Dear Child”) – where children get to do what they do best: play.
They also, often for the first time, experience a theatre performance aimed at sparking their imagination and curiosity.
Then, with the support of our local library, we sign the children up for library cards to encourage them to read.
I know that belonging to a library helped me so much as a child.
What should all adults do for children?
We must share whatever knowledge and skills we have with the next generation while we can.
We must empower them through literacy.
We must help them to imagine better prospects for themselves through stories and storytelling.

From the start, Helen did things differently from most people.
The garden grew and grew, until there was hardly space left for any more creatures.
Miss Helen was tired now.
Her eyes were going blind from working with tiny bits of glass.

Never too early, never too late!
Making time in a busy day to read to children, is an investment in their future, no matter what their age.
These pleasurable times not only show children that you enjoy their company and care about them, but they build lifelong good memories of books and reading too!
IT’S NEVER TOO EARLY!
Do you ever wonder how old children should be when you start reading to them?
Maybe you think you should wait until they have learnt to read before you start.
But would you wait until a baby understands what you are saying before you talk to him or her?
No, because that would make learning to talk difficult!
Well then, you shouldn’t wait for children to be able to read by themselves before you regularly read to them.
Sharing books with pictures, rhymes and stories with babies, teaches them vocabulary and language – and it gets their brains thinking!
It’s also a wonderful way to relax and bond with The more you read aloud and talk to babies, the more words they hear.
Very soon you’ll hear them using these words Reading to babies helps them understand that print has meaning and teaches them how we tell stories.
Most importantly, when adults regularly read to babies and young children, these youngsters grow up seeing reading as fun and worthwhile.
So, they are more likely to choose to read in their free time when they are older.
IT’S NEVER TOO LATE!
 Is it too late to start reading to children when they are already at preschool or school?
Just like it is never too early to start, it is also never too late to start!
Children of all ages benefit from having someone read to them regularly.
 When should you stop reading to children?
Even once children have learnt to read, you can help them get better at it by reading books together that are too complicated for them to tackle on their own.
GA NKE GO NNA THARI!
Did you know?
The more children read,  the better they become at reading, and  the more pleasure they get from it, so,  they are more likely to choose to read.
Do you need advice on reading aloud to children?
You can find lots of ideas and guidance in our “How to guides” in the “Storytelling” section of the Nal’ibali website – www.nalibali.org.
This supplement is available during term times in the following Tiso Blackstar newspapers: Sunday Times Express in the Western Cape; Sowetan in the Free State, Gauteng, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and North West; Daily Dispatch and The Herald in the Eastern Cape.
Making stories part of the physical environment of your school sends a clear message to everyone that your school believes in the importance of reading and storytelling.
Here are some practical ways you can do this.
 Create a notice board where children can post information about what they are reading.
Write a heading for the notice board, for example, “What we are reading” or “Our reading”.
Then leave slips of paper next to the board for children to express whatever they want to about a book, and pin this onto the board.
The slips should have space for the child to write the title of the book, the author and a comment about it.
You might also want to include some star shapes at the bottom for the child to colour in depending on how much they enjoyed the book.
 Find some wall space in the staffroom to display information about books, authors, illustrators, literacy articles and activity ideas for the staff to read.
Make sure to change these regularly to keep them fresh and interesting.
 Paint a wall in the playground with chalkboard paint and supply chalk for children to write or draw their stories on it.
Children could also have fun continuing another child’s story thread.
Encourage them to leave positive comments on the wall about the stories they have read.
 Find inspiring quotes about reading and writing in books and on the internet.
Translate the quotes into all the languages spoken at your school and copy each quote in large writing onto a separate sheet of paper.
Display the quotes around your school to inspire everyone, including visitors!

When children are learning to write, they need to know not only how to write, but also why we write.
They need to have real reasons to write.
The Diaconia/Nal’ibali reading clubs from the NG Kerk Murray, in De Doorns, Western Cape have been doing just that!
Nal’ibali’s Righardt Le Roux explains, “At our reading club sessions children spend time enjoying books and reading.
We also talk about everyday events and situations happening around us and further away.
Then we offer children opportunities to respond to these in ways that are meaningful to them, for example, by using drawing and writing.
“In February 2019, the tragedy that Vanderbijlpark, Gauteng was in the news.
A concrete slab above a corridor linking two blocks of buildings at the school, fell on 26 pupils, killing four and injuring several others.
Some of the children at our clubs had heard about this and so we discussed it at our clubs’ sessions.
Afterwards the children decided to make cards to show support and offer encouragement to the affected families and pupils at the school.
We sent all the cards to Hoërskool Driehoek.
The children from our clubs were reaching out with love and compassion, and used drawing and writing to express their thoughts and feelings.” What a wonderful way for children to learn about the power of writing!

At the beginning of the day, all the teachers read the story to the children in their classes.
We had prepared for the day by asking the children to collect and bring in plastic bottles.
Then after we had read the story1todathem, rotS spent time trying to walk around balancing the bottles on their heads – just like the children in the story.
We finished off with the children doing the other “Get story active!” activities on page 15.

2018/08/31 8:57 AM The sad queen and the tickler By Phumlani Mavimbela  Illustrations by Jiggs Snaddon-Wood There was once a sad queen who always had a frown on her face.
Nothing made “Now let’s try this on the sad queen,” said the tickler and she wiggled the feather on her smile, not even cake … and cake makes everyone smile!
The queen was the end of the queen’s nose.
Nothing!
Not even a silly little smile!
Instead, the queen wealthy as she had many cows, but even that was not enough to turn her frown into “Oh dear, this has never happened before.
The giggly-feather has never failed,” said the tickler.
“Are you sure the queen is just sad and not ill?” Every morning when the queen sat at the table, she barely touched her food.
She did not speak to anyone, not even to the talkative king, and everyone spoke to the king.
“She’s definitely sad,” said the king.
“Look at her!
She always has that frown, and her hand is always against her cheek.
She sighs often too.” When the traditional healer came to examine the queen, he decided she had a condition called “Miimoo”.
He said it made your face look sad when you said that “Then I had better try one more ketiing-ketiing,” said the tickler as she reached into her word slowly.
bag and pulled out a ball of dough.
“Where’s your kitchen?” she asked.
“Is there a way to cure her?” asked the king.
The royal guards showed the tickler where the kitchen was, and there she used her ball of dough to bake a pie.
This pie smelt different from the pies the guards had “Have you tried giving her cake?” asked the healer.
“Yes, we have, many times.
She just frowns at it,” answered the king.
“What’s wrong with your pie?” asked “That is terrible!
No one frowns at cake,” said the healer.
one of the guards.
“It smells like my favourite dish that my grandmother “That’s what I thought too,” said the king.
used to make.” “Then we will have to call the tickler.
She will have the queen smiling in no time,” decided the healer.
“There’s nothing wrong with the pie.
It was yet another blue Monday for the sad queen when the tickler came rattling in to everyone because it smells with all sorts of colourful toy-like objects.
It’s a happy pie.
It smells different explained the tickler.
“What are all these ridiculous things you bring to my kingdom?” asked the king.
The tickler cut a large slice of pie and “You mean these beauties,” said the tickler.
“These are my ketiing-ketiing.” presented it to her royal highness.
When the queen sniffed the pleasant “What a strange name,” said the king.
smell, she burst into tears.
“It’s really simple.
I call them that because ketiing-ketiing is the sound they make when they are used together,” said the tickler.
“Now tell me, what’s wrong with “Now look, you’ve made things the queen?” worse!” said the king to the tickler.
“Well, she is sad and has been for six years, eight months, three weeks and two “Look again,” said the tickler.

“Do you think you can help?” The king looked at the queen.
She was smiling and in tears!

Flying Lerato One day, long ago, a girl called Lerato was walking through the veld when she saw a little black pig fast asleep under a bush.
“Aha,” said Lerato.
“We will eat well tonight.” Lerato grabbed the little pig, but to her surprise, it squeaked, Lerato stared at the pig.
“What will you give me?” she asked.
“Well, for one week,” said the pig, “you’ll be able to fly like a bird in the sky … Nal’ibali is here to motivate and support you.

South Africa is celebrating National Book Week from 2 to 8 September 2019 and, together with the rest of the world, commemorates International Literacy Day on 8 September.
Libraries have a very important role to play in supporting literacy.
Are you a librarian who wants to share the power of stories and reading with children?
Are you looking for ways to get children to visit the library regularly?
Here are some ideas that other librarians shared with us that will help you do this.
New members Use National Book Week to encourage children Treasure hunt Help children become familiar with your library by inviting them to join in a “treasure hunt”.
Run special events at your library that will attract new members and show everyone what libraries have to offer.
New members Use National Book Week to encourage children Treasure hunt Help children become familiar with your library by inviting them to join in a “treasure hunt”.
Hide small items in different parts of the library, then write clues that will help the children find the items.
For example: “You will find this treasure on the shelf where the books about wild animals are.” Let the children work in pairs to find the items.
Holiday activities Offer a school holiday programme at your library where children are able to listen to stories, act them out, write their own stories and do fun craft activities like card- and puppet-making.
INTRODUCING BOOKS TO CHILDREN Time for tots Set aside a special library time each week for 0 to 2 year olds and their caregivers.
Spend time sharing children’s songs and rhymes together.
Then provide board books and other books for babies for them to read together.
Story time Offer a story half-hour for young children once or twice a week where you read aloud from different picture books in the library.
Remember to display these afterwards so that children can look at them on their own.
Have paper and crayons available so they can draw pictures inspired by the stories after you have read them.

different cut-out-and-keep books from the Nal’ibali Supplement, that you have read to the children recently.
Next to each book, place an empty container, for example, a peanut butter jar, margarine tub or box.
Give each child a small piece of paper which will be their voting slip and ask them to write their name on it.
Ask the children to place their voting slip in the container next to the story that they most enjoyed.
Together, add up the votes for each book to see which story they loved the most – and then let us know by emailing info@nalibali.org.
(Please put FOR THE NAL’IBALI SUPPLEMENT in the subject line.)
Spread the message Help others learn about the pleasure of reading by arranging a reading club session in a safe, but busy public space over the weekend, such as a local shopping centre, supermarket or library.
Ask the parents/caregivers of some of the club members to help out on the day.
Invite children passing by to join the usual club members, and have fun reading.
Make story videos Let the children decide whether they want to read, tell or act out a short story on their own or in groups.
Use a cellphone to record them as they do this.
Use a cellphone to record them as they do this.
(If there are a lot of children at your club, then ask a few groups to perform at the same time and film a part of each of their performances.)
Design posters Ask the children to think about the ways in which reading and writing make a difference in their lives.
Then ask them to write a slogan about literacy and to draw pictures that go with it.
(A slogan is a few words that together communicate a message about something, for example: Literacy makes you a leader.)
Display the finished posters at your reading club to help you create a print-rich environment for the children.

It was Tuesday and there was no school.
“There’s a drawing here,” Dad grumbled, looking at his phone.
His favourite author, Joan Rankin, was coming to the library to read from the books she had written, and his dad had promised to take him to see her.
Neo had written a special book about her, and he couldn’t wait to give it to her.
The washing machine was making a terrible rattling, coughing noise as if it was going to explode.
But when Neo got up on Tuesday morning, there was a funny noise coming from the kitchen.

Neo found a seat at the back and settled down to listen.
Her story was wonderful, and so were her pictures.
Neo hoped he’d be able to draw like that one day.
And the best of all?
When she’d finished and Neo showed her his book, she thought it was wonderful.
“Did you really write this story all by yourself?” she “Yes,” said Neo.
It’s a present Then Joan Rankin opened her bag and took out one of her books.
Inside she wrote, “For Neo, who makes beautiful books”, and she signed her name in big letters and gave it to him.
in a Neo was so happy.
He held the book so tightly he never wanted to let it go.
Just then Dad came over.
“You won’t believe it,” he said.
“I found a book on how to fix washing machines, and look − the drawings are big and clear.
Why didn’t you tell me the library had books like this, Neo?” “Ee,” ga rialo Neo.

Our stories, our heritage!
Every family has stories to tell!
Some of these stories might be ones that were told to you as a child.
The stories of our families are as unique as the people in our family!
These stories are part of each family’s history and they help children understand where they come from and who they are.
There are many different kinds of stories in each family.
Some stories are about imaginary or mythical characters and are passed down from generation to generation.
Families share stories about the everyday experiences of family members – now and in the past.
These are the stories we tell when our children say, “Mom, tell me a story about when you were little.” Or it’s the stories we tell at supper time about what happened to us as we were trying to reach something on the top shelf at the supermarket this morning.
When we share stories about our everyday lives, we build connections with our children – we allow them to know more about us.
Some family stories are about real or imaginary people outside the family.
These stories are part of each family’s history and they help children understand where they come from and who they are.

Re tla bo re le mo boikhutsong mo Benefits of telling our stories Listening to our stories helps children learn and develop.
1.
The stories we tell, help them understand how stories work.
For example, they learn that stories have a beginning, a middle and an end.
They also learn that the events in a story help it build up to a climax, which is the most exciting part of the story.
When children know how stories work, it helps them when they are reading stories in books and writing their own stories!
2.
As we talk about what happened to us today or long ago, we often include how we felt at the time, for example, “It was really, really dark and I was so scared, but I kept walking towards the bathroom because I wanted to find out what the noise was.” When we talk about how we felt in a situation, we give our children the language to talk about their own feelings.
When children know how stories work, it helps them when they are reading stories in books and writing their own stories!

Celebrate our heritage!
September is Heritage Month in South Africa and we celebrate Heritage Day on 24 September.
Here are ideas for some fun activities to grow children’s creativity and encourage them to have fun with reading and writing whilst they explore the concept of “heritage”.
Remember to choose the activities that are best suited to the children’s ages and interests.
The activities can be done with the children at your reading club, in your class or at your library as well as with your own children at home!
Ask the children to draw a picture of their favourite story and to then tell you about the story and why they like it so much.
Don’t forget to join in with the children as they do this activity – for you to be a good reading and writing role model, the children need to know that you enjoy reading too!
Share a story.
Ask the children to draw a picture of their favourite story and to then tell you about the story and why they like it so much.
Spend some time talking to the children about special times they have enjoyed with their families.
Then divide the children into groups.

Every morning he took his father’s cattle to the veld.
He loved his father and he loved the cattle he minded for him.
His father always praised him because he did his work with much care.
One day, while Soyiso was watching the cattle, he suddenly looked up from the clay cattle he was playing with and noticed a strange calf.
Just to make sure he wasn’t making a mistake, Soyiso quickly counted the herd of cattle.
Before he had come to the end of the song, the calf trotted over and joined the rest of the herd.

Even while they were beating it and beating it and beating it, the calf stood still and silent.
The other cattle made a terrible, mournful sound.
As they watched the ignorant, unfeeling men beat Buhle, the cattle gave a melancholy bellow – long, low and bitterly sad.
Tremors rippled their coats and their heads hung low.
Not one cow or bull grazed or chewed the cud.

Connect with stories Encourage your children to be readers by helping them connect with the stories and books you read aloud to them.
This is easy to do because children love to explore how the stories they read, relate to their own life experiences.
They are also always eager to learn and know more about things they are interested in.
Here are some ideas for helping children connect to stories – before, during and after you have read them aloud.
Talk about the front cover of the book.
Ask your children what they think the story could be about.
Read the blurb on the back cover together.
What does it tell you about the story?
What does it make your children want to find out more about?
If the story is set in a real place, find the place on Allow time for your children to look at the pictures closely.
Point out interesting details in the pictures.
Together with your children, make the sounds and movements of the characters in the stories – a princess.
Use different voices for different characters.
Use facial expressions and gestures to act out a character you are reading about.
After reading aloud Ask your children what part of the story they liked the most.
Together with your children act out this part of the story.
Encourage them to interpret it in their own way.
Their interpretation does not have to be exactly the same as in the book.
Encourage your children to connect with the characters in the story by asking them to talk about a time when they felt the same way the character did, for example, angry, scared or sad.
Ask your children to think of other stories they know that are similar in some way to the story you have just read.
Talk about the way that these stories are similar and different.
Talk about interesting facts or characteristics of any animals or places in the story, for example, in which parts of the world hyenas are found, what they like to eat and how long they live.
Even after reading time is over, pretend to be the story characters until bedtime, or for part of the following day.
Together, change the names of the characters in the story to the names of people you know.
Then read the story again using these names.
This supplement is available during term times in the following Tiso Blackstar newspapers: Sunday Times Express in the Western Cape; Sowetan in the Free State, Gauteng, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and North West; Daily Dispatch and The Herald in the Eastern Cape.
Get creative!
Making books with children is a great way to help them understand the link between reading and writing.
You can make simple books, like the cut-out-and-keep books in the supplement, or books that will last longer.
Here are some ideas to try.
Create a story 1.
Invite your children to tell you or a friend a story.
2.
Then let them plan which part of the story they will put on each page of their book.
3.
Give each child a blank book, and invite them to write and illustrate their story.
Remember that the children can illustrate their stories in different ways, for example, by drawing pictures, pasting in photos and pasting in things like tickets, pieces of fabric, invitations or small, flat objects.
Make a book cover Cut out two sheets of thin cardboard for the front and back cover.
Each sheet should be a bit bigger than the pages of your book.
Cut out two pieces of pretty paper, or use blank paper and decorate it to suit what your story is about.
Each piece of paper should be longer and wider than the cardboard in (1).
Then place one piece of pretty paper face-down and paste a sheet of the cardboard from (1) in the middle.
Repeat this with the other sheet of pretty paper and cardboard.
Bind the book Put the story pages inside the covers.

Reading club corner One way to bring stories to life at your reading club, is to turn stories into plays!
You can either work on one story altogether, or divide the children into smaller groups to work on different stories.
Follow the steps below and have fun!
1.
Choose the right story Find a story that is not too long and has plenty of action in it.
Make sure that the story has opportunities for the children to use actions and their voices to tell the story.
Stories with some rhyme and passages that are repeated are good to use, for example: I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house down.
2.
Explore the story together Read the story to the children and show them the pictures as you read.
Ask the children to suggest ways to show different actions in the story, for example, trees swaying in a storm, an angry character thumping her fists, or a scared character hiding from danger.
Try out the actions together.
3.
Organise the groups Buisetsa bana leinane mme o ba bontshe ditshwantsho fa o ntse o buisa.
Invite two or more children to be the narrators.
They will read or tell the story while other children act it out.
Invite some children to play the characters.
If you can, use simple costumes, such as a hat, scarf or piece of fabric.
Children who are not narrators or characters can be part of the special effects team.
They can work together to use their bodies to create sound effects, for example: thunder, rain or animals galloping.
Or they can represent objects or places in the story, for example: a flower, a box, a cave or a house.
Now you’re ready to begin – enjoy retelling the story as a play!
Nal’ibali has launched a new project called, Story Power in Motion, which will see four tuktuk mobile libraries visiting selected townships in KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape, the Loaded with books, stories and other reading materials, these colourful libraries will promote reading for enjoyment and also increase access to books for those living beyond the easy reach of a public library.
In addition, they will offer fun public literacy events.
Each mobile-library driver is a trained Nal’ibali Literacy Mentor.
They will help children select books and will also do literacy-related activities with them, such as telling stories and singing songs.
At the launch of the project in each province, community members were able to find out more about the mobile libraries, including information about their set weekly route and when they will be visiting the area.
Nal’ibali Supplements and brochures were handed out to those attending the launches.
“We believe every child should have the opportunity to reach their potential by falling in love with books and stories,” said Nompumelelo Prusent, Head of Programmes at Nal’ibali.
“This year alone we hope to reach at least 4 000 adults and children through events hosted by our mobile libraries, and we hope to sign up a further 2 000 library members.” One of the new tuk-tuk mobile libraries at the launch in Orlando West, Soweto.

“Did I teach you how to be a good guard?” he barked.

If you do, I’ll give you a hot meal, you can sleep on the little bed again, AND I’ll scratch your back.” Dog licked his lips.
The hot meal had been delicious, and the little bed was comfortable – much more comfortable than a cave floor – and he’d never had anyone scratch his At sunset, Dog came wandering through the bushveld towards Nobantu’s hut.

Dog gobbled up the meal.
“You know, Nobantu,” Dog barked, “for three nights in a row I’ve tried my best to teach you how to be a good guard, but you don’t seem to get it at all.
I don’t think you’ll ever learn how to do it.” “I wonder what I can do to help Dog?” she thought.
“He looks so lonely.” “I won’t?” asked Nobantu with a smile.
As Nobantu thought about a plan, Dog woke up and barked at her.
“No, I don’t think so,” answered Dog.
“The problem is that you sleep inside, your ears “Dog,” she called out, “you are an excellent guard.” are too small, and you can’t see in the dark.

Travel with stories Books don’t just have words and pictures in them.
They are filled with adventure – new places to go and new people to meet!
One way you and your children can travel to new places every day, is through reading stories together.
Some of the places you’ll travel to may be imaginary, while others may be real.
Either way, your children will learn lots without even realising it!

Some stories about new places may have words from other languages in them, so you could learn how to say things in another language.
2.
Stories can show us how people from different places are similar and different to us at the same time!
No matter how different our daily lives are, we are all the same in some ways.
We all need to be loved and to love, and we all need a safe place to live and enough food to eat.
3.
Some stories introduce you to new things you might want to try!
Reading about new foods or games may encourage you to try them.
Or, reading a story set in a place different to where you live, may make you want to travel there one day!
4.
Stories about nature help us see how all living things work together to keep our planet alive.
They take us to places we sometimes forget about as we lead our busy lives.

Timi and the barber By Ndidi Chiazor-Enenmor  Illustrations by Natalie and Tamsin Hinrichsen After Timi had left with his mother that day, Jango sat down with a cup of tea and thought and thought.
Surely there had to be a way to stop Timi from crying while his hair was being cut!
And that’s when Jango had his good idea!
“That’s it!
I’ve solved it,” he shouted excitedly.
Timi and his mother lived in Mozala Town.
There was something very unusual about Timi – his hair!
It grew very quickly.
It grew so quickly that every Saturday, Timi’s mother had to take him to the barber to have his hair cut.
And if there was one thing that Timi really didn’t like, it was having his hair cut!
Haircut time was worry time for Mom because Timi would cry.
On Timi’s next visit, as soon as Jango took out his scissors, he began to “I don’t want to have my hair cut!” “Once there was a young boy who did not like to get his hair cut, so he let it grow and grow,” said Jango.
“It grew until his head was full of knotty strands of hair.
Soon the knotty strands became twisted together.” Mom would they set off to the as soon as they arrived, Timi would burst into tears.
“What happened next?” asked Timi, who had stopped crying.
“Flies and other insects decided to make their homes in his hair,” continued Jango.
“So, what happened to him?” asked Timi, looking worried.
“The young boy began to pull at his hair and to scratch because the insects that were crawling around on his head made it very, very itchy.
He pulled and scratched, and pulled and scratched all day long.
Soon, his head and his hands began to hurt from all the pulling and scratching,” said Jango.
Then Mom would have to do all sorts of things to try still while he was having his hair cut.

First, he would sniffle, then he would sob, and then he “It’s only a haircut, Timi.
It’s not painful,” Jango would say, trying to calm Timi down, but that made Timi cry even louder.
Sometimes Jango would sing to comfort Timi, but still Timi kept crying.

“Oh, my goodness!
It is only a young boy having his hair cut,” they said.
Timi did not care that people came to stare at him.
He cried and cried until Jango had finished cutting his hair.
Jango.
“And when I had finished cutting the boy’s hair – just as I have done yours now – the boy gave me a very big hug.” Another day, he wailed so loudly that Grandma Binite came limping in with her walking stick.
She lived next door to the barbershop, but had been woken up from her afternoon nap by Timi’s loud wails.
Timi looked at his head.
His haircut was finished!
He had been enjoying the story so much that he hadn’t noticed Jango cutting his hair.
He jumped out of the chair and gave Jango a big hug.
“Oh, my word!” Grandma Binite said.
“I thought something terrible was going on!” Then she limped back to her house to get Timi a piece of tasty grilled fish she had made.
“I’m sure this will make him stop crying,” she thought.
But when she gave Timi the fish, he popped it into his mouth, chewed and swallowed … and then went on crying!
And do you know what?
Timi never cried again at the barbershop because Jango had a new story to tell him at every visit!
And Timi’s mom was very happy because Jango’s stories meant an end to her weekly haircut worries.

Share a picture book!
November is International Picture Book Month!
It’s a time to celebrate those special books with wonderful stories and beautiful pictures that we all love so much.
Picture books are meant to be read aloud, so this makes them the perfect reading resource for sharing stories with children.
Here are some of our tips to help you do this.
tsa mainane a a itumedisang le dintshwantsho tse dintle tse re di SHARE THE STORY 1.
Start by spending some time looking at and talking about the book’s front cover.
Don’t forget to read the story’s title and the names of the author and illustrator.
2.
Make sure that the children can see the pictures as you read.
Sit close together if you are reading to one or two children.
With more children, have them sit in front of you and hold up the book to show them the pictures as you read the story.
bontsha ditshwantsho fa o tsweleletse go buisa leinane.
3.
Involve your children!
Younger children often enjoy turning the pages.
Invite older readers to read the words of one of the characters, or a paragraph or two of the story.
4.
Try different things to make stories come alive.
Use different voices for different characters.
Read softly in quiet, gentle parts of a story.
Read quickly if a character is in a hurry or is being chased.
Read in a big, booming voice for loud noises in the story.
5.
Allow time for your children to look at the pictures and spend time looking closely at the pictures together.
Comment on things you are curious about or that you notice and like.
Encourage your children to do the same.
6.
Encourage your children to ask questions.
Answer them if you can, or look for the answers together by re-reading and discussing parts of the story, and looking at some of the pictures again.
1.
Talk about the story together.
Encourage your children to share their opinions of the ways in which the characters in the story behaved and the choices they made.
leinane, lo ntse lo lebile ditshwantsho gape.
2.
Find ways for children to explore the story you have read to them.
For example, they could retell and act out parts of the story, or they could draw a picture of something the story makes them feel or think of, or they could write a letter to one of the story characters.
Which stories?
Choose picture books that you enjoy, but also ones that match your children’s changing interests.
Repeat stories.
Children often like to hear their favourite stories again and again.
They discover new things about the story each time you read it.

But he will never again trust those mischievous cattle!

Just one thing Gogo sat on her favourite red chair, and Zinhle sat on the mat in front of her.
Gogo worried her.
When her friends skipped, their hair flew up and down, and flicked from braided Zinhle’s hair.
The other girls watched eagerly.
As Gogo combed and braided side to side.
Zinhle had a thick mop of soft hair that formed a big round shape, and it different patterns, Zongi and Sindi were amazed by the length of Zinhle’s hair.

“Wow!
Your mama is right,” said Sindi.
“Your hair really IS magical!
It looks so short, but it’s longer than you think!” “It’s true,” said Zongi.
“It’s a big surprise!” Zinhle smiled at them happily.
When Gogo had finished braiding Zinhle’s hair, the cornrows looked just like a map to guide the children to kwaNtuli!
As they walked along the narrow paths through the veld, Zongi and Sindi often stopped and studied Zinhle’s hair to make sure that they were still going in the right direction.
While they walked, they sang a song they had made up: “Gogo’s not well, we’re going to fetch herbs – herbs to make Gogo well!” The children finally arrived at kwaNtuli.
There Baba Ntuli gave them two packets of herbs for Gogo.
On their way home the girls again used Zinhle’s cornrow map to guide them.
When they arrived safely at Gogo’s house, they gave her the medicine.
The next morning, Zinhle, Zongi and Sindi went to Gogo’s house to see if she was better.
When they arrived, they found her watering her garden.
One Saturday morning Zinhle asked her mother, “Mama, why doesn’t my hair grow down like my friends’ hair?
Their hair flies about when they skip.
It looks so pretty!
It makes me sad that my hair doesn’t move like that.
It just stays still!” “Your hair may be different from your friends’ hair, but it’s just as beautiful as theirs!” said Mama.
Zinhle made a sad face, but her mama just smiled at her.
“Look around you, Zinhle,” she said.
“Your hair grows from the roots up, like the trees and plants.
It’s also round and big, just like the earth we live on.
You can play around with it too and make beautiful patterns and shapes in it.
Your hair is magical – and that is special!” These words made Zinhle happy.
She ran outside to tell her friends about her magical hair.
But when she told Zongi and Sindi what Mama had said, they just looked at each other, and burst out laughing.
“How can hair be magic?” asked Zongi.
“Ha-ha-ha!” laughed Sindi.
“Don’t joke like that, Zinhle!
Magic?
Never!” Zinhle’s eyes filled with tears, but she didn’t cry.
She didn’t want Zongi and Sindi to Just then, the girls saw Gogo waving to them.
She was standing in her “Look, Gogo’s calling us,” said Zinhle.
The three children loved helping Gogo.
She told them lots of stories and gave them “Good morning, my children,” said Gogo with a big smile.
“I’m feeling much stronger dried fruit every time they visited her.
So Zinhle, Zongi and Sindi hurried to find out why today, all thanks to you!” Gogo was calling them.
The girls were happy to hear that they had helped Gogo, but they were thinking about “I’m not well today,” said Gogo.
“I want to send you to kwaNtuli to get some medicine.” something else too.
The children were sad to hear that Gogo wasn’t well and agreed to go and get her “Gogo, would you please braid my hair the same way you did Zinhle’s hair?” Ntuli’s place, and he’ll give you some herbs.” Then Gogo went inside to find paper and a pencil to draw the map.
She looked in her drawer, but she couldn’t find any paper.
“I’ll have to make another plan,” she said.

Then she said, “Zinhle, you have very beautiful their magic hairstyles.

World Read Aloud In 2009, LitWorld, a literacy organisation in the USA, started World Read Aloud Day because it wanted to create a platform which ordinary people could use to show the world that they believe in everybody’s right to read and share stories.
Since then, every year on World Read Aloud Day, people all around the world read aloud together and share stories to advocate for literacy as a human right.

Reading aloud to your children helps to develop the bond between a parent and child.

When you read aloud to children and they enjoy the story, they see reading as a satisfying activity and this helps to motivate them to read for themselves.
3.
Reading aloud to young children shows them how we read and how books work.
This knowledge makes it much easier for them to learn to read later on.
4.
Children are able to understand and enjoy stories that are beyond their own reading ability when they hear them read aloud.
5.
Hearing new words used in a story develops children’s vocabulary and gives them a rich language to draw from when they write their own stories.

Invite adults and children to come along and share stories that are important to them, whether these are tales passed down through their families, or come from books that are special to them.
Give away material on the importance of reading to children.
You can find tip sheets in different South African languages to download for free in the “Story sharing” section of the Nal’ibali website: www.nalibali.org.
At work: Leading up to World Read Aloud Day, organise a book collection drive by asking your co-workers to donate books that can be given to a local school or reading club.
And on 5 February spend time as part of a meeting, during a lunch break, or after hours reading together.

Lorato is a qualified teacher and librarian, a literacy activist who is passionate about children’s literature (particularly in indigenous languages), a published author and a member of the team that produces the Nal’ibali Supplement.
How did you start writing for children?
When I worked as a librarian in my hometown of Kuruman in the Northern Cape, there were no children’s books in Setswana so I started re-versioning English stories into Setswana for local teachers and children.
When I saw the happy faces of the children as they listened to stories in their mother tongue, I knew it was a myth that South Africans don’t want to read in African languages!
What advice would you give someone wanting to write for children?
Put yourself in a child’s shoes when you write, and read, read and read children’s stories!
What languages do you write and read in?
I write mostly in Setswana, but also in English.
I read in Setswana and English, What makes children want to read?
Interesting, colourful stories.
Stories that reflect their own lives and identities.
Have you always liked books?
Yes, for as long as I can remember.
Even now, when I go to a party, I take a book with me to read!
Who helped to grow a love of reading in you?
My mother and my aunt.
They were master story tellers who told me stories every single night!
I knew then this was what I wanted to do with my life.
the sentence: Stories are … … mpho mo lefatsheng!
… a gift to the world!

For more information, visit Hope, Neo and Josh are off to the park for some fun, but things don’t work out quite as Hope had planned.
When they arrive at the park, it’s filled with people who have come to listen to the mayor’s speech.
Then Bella, her mom and Noodle arrive and that’s when everything A day to remember Josh found some thin sticks next to a dustbin and the three friends sat behind the bush using string from Hope’s bag to tie them together in a cross-shape for the creature’s body.
Then Hope blew up the balloon and tied that on for the creature’s head.
Neo saw how sad Hope was.
“Nice plan, Hope!” he said.
“Let’s go over there behind that big bush.
No one will see us there.” Josh and Hope nodded in agreement and off they went.
“Josh, you go and find some sticks.
Neo, take off your pirate hat and eye patch,” instructed Hope as she took her karate clothes and a balloon out of her bag.
They dressed the creature in Hope’s karate clothes and Neo’s pirate hat and eye patch.
Josh tied the creature onto his kite.
And then they were ready!

“A re yeng kwa morago ga setlhare tsa ga Neo tsa magodu a lewatle, hutshe le petšhe ya leitlho.
Josh a Even though Hope’s plan did not quite work out, it was a day they would all remember!
Then Hope explained her plan and how it had gone wrong.
The mayor listened, and when Hope had finished, he just looked at her … and then he started laughing.
“Well, now you can write your own scary creature story,” the mayor suggested.
The children hid behind the bush and loosened the kite’s string.
A strong gust of wind took the creature off into the sky.
Up, up, up it went, racing across the sky away from them.
“Ao bathong!
Phaka e tletse thata gore leano la me le dire,” “No,” says Granny.
“It sounds much bigger than a bird.

“That dog is very smelly!” Down the road from Zoey’s house, there is a big, green park.
Zoey is quite shy, but she loves to play in the park.

And from that day on, Zoey, Granny and their new friend played in the park every day.
She can find the prettiest flowers and the tallest trees.
Granny needs glasses to see.
But she can hear very well.
“You found us!” says Zoey.
“Now, let’s give you a bath.” The next day, Zoey comes home from school and packs her bag.
“Are you ready to go to the park?” asks Granny.
“Yes, please,” says Zoey.
Zoey is good at finding things – even better than Granny!
She can find birds and bugs.
“Granny, look who’s outside!” says Zoey.

It was about a girl who had bravely saved her village from a scary creature.
Hope had enjoyed the book so much that she had finished it in a day and had even dreamt about the scary creature that night!
Neo, Josh, Hope, Bella and her mom raced over to help.
They found the mayor on the ground next to the creature with Noodle still barking at it.
The children helped to calm Noodle down while Bella’s mom helped the mayor up.
“Hurry up, Neo, we don’t have much time!” said Hope putting down her heavy bag.
Hope and Josh were waiting for Neo.
They were all going to the park as part of Hope’s plan!
When they got to the park, they saw the mayor surrounded by a large crowd of people.
“What’s going on?” Josh asked a woman standing nearby.
In the meantime, Bella and her mom had arrived at the park to walk Noodle.
When Noodle saw the creature dangling in the sky, he started barking and pulling on his leash.
Bella tried to hold onto Noodle’s leash, but he pulled so hard that she had to let go.
Off went Noodle across the park.
Bella and her mom chased after him.
“Well, for a long time, the mayor got lots of complaints because there wasn’t enough shade in the park,” she said.
“So, he made sure that lots of new trees were planted and today he’s here to celebrate this with everyone.” “Oh no!
The park is too full for my plan to work,” said Hope, “What plan?” asked Neo and Josh at the same time, looking at each other.
“Do you remember the story I read about the brave girl who saved her village?” asked Hope.
“Well, I was hoping we could make a scary creature, tie it to Josh’s kite and then fly it over the park.
But now look!” said Hope pointing to the happy people standing around the mayor.
“Trust me, you’ll enjoy this!” said Hope as she walked off ahead of her friends.
Neo and Josh followed, trying to “I’m as clueless as you are, Neo.
Hope just asked me to bring my kite to the park,” said Josh pointing to his kite.
“I hope that what you’ve planned for us will be fun.
Why are you in such a hurry?” Neo asked Hope as he shut the front door.
Neo was wearing his favourite pirate hat and eye patch.
O ne a apere diaparo tsa gagwe tse a di ratang thata, hutshe Then the creature started to float down towards the mayor’s head as he was making his speech!
Noodle was running towards him still barking at the creature – and Bella and her mom were not far behind.
Josh pulled on the kite’s string, trying to get the creature up higher into the sky, but it was too late.
Noodle leapt up at the creature, knocking over the mayor.
Bits of paper with the mayor’s speech on it flew all over the park, and people started running in all directions.

You will need: two long, thin sticks; string; a plastic shopping Lay the two sticks on top of each other in the shape of a cross.
Wind some string tightly around the middle of the cross (where the two sticks meet) to keep the sticks together.
Cut a plastic shopping bag down one side and across the bottom.
Then lay it out flat.
Place the sticks on the plastic bag.
Use a koki and a ruler to draw lines on the plastic bag that join the four ends of the sticks.
Once you have done this, you should have a diamond shape on the plastic bag.
Cut out the diamond shape.
Tape the diamond shape to the sticks at the top, bottom and on the sides.
Cut some strips from the part of the plastic bag that you didn’t use for the diamond shape.
Use tape to stick these to the bottom of the kite to make a tail.

Hazel lived on a farm with lots of other animals, like cows, sheep, ducks in the water.
A beautiful looking hen stared back at her!
The feathers on her body were and a peacock.

Hazel jumped up and down with joy!
Hazel had a beautiful voice and sang so sweetly that all the other animals decided that She was so excited that she burst out in song … but as she started singing, a loud her job on the farm would be to wake them up every morning with her lovely melodies.

What had happened to her beautiful voice?
Very early each morning, Hazel would sit on top of the big rock by the gate and start singing.
Pok-pok-a-dooooooooo!
Cluck-cluck-a-roooooooo!
All the other animals loved waking up to the sounds of her wonderful voice.
Now, although she was a good singer, Hazel did not like what she looked like at all.
“My creamy feathers are boring, and my legs aren’t long enough.
There is nothing special about the way I look.
Philani, the peacock, is such a beautiful bird with his long neck and legs.
He has glorious feathers that change colours in the reflection of the All the other animals on the farm heard the loud noise and woke up, frightened.

At Nal’ibali we are often asked for reading advice.
There are some questions that people have asked us often over the years.
So, we thought we would share the five most frequently asked questions with you – as well as our responses to them.
What’s the point of reading to babies when they don’t understand what you are reading?
Reading to babies and toddlers stimulates their thinking and develops their language.
They may not be able to speak yet, but they are listening and engaging with every word that you say!
Sharing books is also a great way to bond with your baby.
When she enjoys looking at books with you, she learns that books are things that make her feel good!
And so, she’s more likely to want to learn to read them later on.
My child has learnt to read.
Should I stop reading aloud to him?
No!
Find books which you think he would enjoy, but are still a little bit too difficult for him to read on his own, and read these aloud to him.
Which books are good ones to read to my child?
Any book that your child enjoys is a good book because it encourages their love of reading and books.
Always try to find books in your child’s mother tongue and read those together before you start introducing books in another language.
Get your 2020 literacy Sharing books How often and for how long should I read to my child?
If possible, you should read aloud to your child every day for 15 minutes.
Some children may want to spend more time than this sharing books with you.
Other children – especially very young ones − may find it difficult to concentrate for 15 minutes.
Your children should always enjoy you reading to them and it shouldn’t feel like a chore, so rather break the 15 minutes up into smaller chunks of time.
I want my children to respect books and take care of them.
How can I teach them to do this?
If your children see you treating books with respect, they will learn to do this too.
If they get pleasure from you reading aloud to them, they will take good care of books because they treasure the stories in them!

Your story We love getting stories written by you!
Here is the story about Chai.
It was written in English by FUNda Leader, Tebogo Machai from Vosloorus.
Themba a botsa, “Fela foo re setlhopha mme re a thusana.” Chai o ne a itumetse tha o a setlhopha se sengw e kete a rata go thiba Ch a kgwele mme motsh olo mo botshelong jwa a tsholeleditswe kwa go Chai was a physically challenged boy who wanted to play football like every boy.
Every time when the boys of the village were playing soccer, Chai would wait off the field watching the boys kicking the ball around.
What was more enticing to Chai was when the boys were calling each other to pass the ball around, like, “Themba, pass, pressure him!” and so on.
One day the boys realised how desperately Chai wanted to play football and they decided to Themba asked, “But Chai cannot run fast.
What can we do to involve him?” “Oooh, I have a plan.
Let us pretend that we are struggling to catch up to him,” said Neo.
Well, after the boys were done planning how to include Chai in their team, they went to Chai's home and asked him to come and play with them because Rob “But I cannot run fast like any one of you guys,” The boys said, “No, Chai, as long as you can walk fast.
Besides we are a team and we rely on each other.” Chai was so excited as he put his soccer boots on and marched onto the football field.
Upon their arrival at the football ground, the ball started to roll and they gave it to Chai who was waiting for it.
The spectators were cheering behind Chai As he was nearing the goalkeeper, the members of the other team pushed each other pretending to catch and block Chai.
But when Chai was very close to the goalkeeper, he kicked the ball which was missed by the goalkeeper and it was a goal.
Everyone was cheering the name, “Chai!
Chai!
Chai!” as he was lifted up.
That was the biggest day of Chai’s life.
Even today, the picture of Chai being lifted after scoring that goal still hangs on his bedroom wall.

Tortoise and his banjo thupa mo kaleng ya setlhare.
O tla ba ruta go tshela le batho.
Ugbua … Now, Leopard was getting anxious.
The animals were working more slowly.
They kept throwing him glances, expecting him to offer them refreshments.
So Leopard kept looking towards the entrance to his farm.
Where were his wives?
Why hadn’t his son returned?
Too embarrassed to say anything, he set off to find out.
Well, you can guess what Leopard saw when he began marching down the road.
Even from a distance, he recognised the dancers.
How dare his wives ignore his orders!
In a rage, he stripped a whipping branch from a tree.
He would teach them a lesson they wouldn’t forget.

For more information, visit Once, in a far, far land, Leopard needed workers for his farm.
So he invited all the animals in his town to a work-party.
He promised them plenty of food and palm wine if they helped him prepare his land for planting.
Ugbua … Now, I should tell you that Leopard invited everyone except Tortoise.
When Tortoise found out, he was very upset.
He was also embarrassed that Leopard believed he was too weak for hard work.
Well, thought Tortoise, I’ll show him!
Without saying a word, he set off to talk with Rabbit in the neighbouring town.
However, as the melody wafted towards him, it wove a spell over his feet, body and head.
He dropped his whipping branch and began to dance.
Whirling and swirling.
Back in the field, the workers were utterly exhausted.
Leopard had invited them to a work-PARTY.
Where were the refreshments he had promised?
How mean of Leopard to lie to them!
Stomachs rumbled as the animals grumbled.
Finally, taking their knives and hoes, they set off home.
They had not gone far before the music wafted towards them.
It wove its spell over their feet, bodies and heads.
Their hunger vanished.
They too put down their tools and began to dance.
Whirling and swirling.
Doggy wants to play.

Catch, Woof-woof!
Look, Doggy’s bringing the ball.
Woof-woof out!
Se tshabe.
Now you play.
Don’t be scared.
Woof-woof out!
Ugbua … Now, Tortoise peeped out.
With everyone there, he plucked the thrills and trills.
He began to sing his song more loudly, more clearly.
As the workers danced, they heard the words and each felt a little foolish.
Why break your backs for Leopard?
Tortoise carried on playing until he sensed that the dancers were weary.
Suddenly the music stopped.
The music was so mysterious and the melody so enchanting that Leopard’s son didn’t even listen to the words.
His feet began to dance, his body swayed and his head nodded.
Whirling and swirling, he completely forgot his father’s message.
Very soon, Leopard’s son had company.
His father’s wives hadn’t forgotten their task, but, as they came from town, they too were charmed by the music.
They put down the plates of food and the gourds with palm wine so they could dance more freely.
Whirling and swirling.
“Next time, I hope you will not forget the needs of all your fellow creatures.” With that, Tortoise turned to the animals from his town.
“Goodbye, Leopard’s workers!
Goodbye, my dancers!” Tortoise waved, slung his banjo on his back and descended into his tunnel.
It was the shortest way home.
The other animals also set off along the road home.
It would be a long time before Leopard was allowed to forget his mistake because, every now and again, he would hear someone singing, Why break your backs for Leopard?” The next morning, all the invited animals gathered at Leopard’s farm.
Each brought a knife or a hoe.
Soon they were busy cutting and digging.
They worked hard in the blazing sun.
When it was nearly noon, Leopard saw the sweat on their bodies and sent his eldest son home to remind his wives to bring the refreshments.
Ugbua … Now, someone else was digging all that morning.
That someone was quietly burrowing an underground tunnel to arrive near Leopard’s farm.
That someone was Rabbit from the neighbouring town.
He was also working very hard.
Tortoise was going to pay him well.
The spell broke and Tortoise emerged from his hole.
He fixed his “You didn’t invite me to work for you, Leopard.
So, you see, I had It was now Leopard who felt foolish.
He didn’t say anything.
“You told everyone I was weak,” Tortoise continued.
“Am I and my banjo not strong enough to break your plan?” Leopard still said nothing.
Meanwhile, Tortoise tied his banjo to his back and waited for the dust to settle.
When Rabbit announced that he had finished, Tortoise began crawling through his new tunnel.
It was noon when he reached the far end.
Carefully, he popped his head above the hole.
Yes, he was near Leopard’s farm – and here was Leopard’s eldest son coming along the road!
Tortoise slid down out of sight, untied his banjo and began to strum, while singing a little song, “Poor animals working for Leopard Silly animals working for Leopard Drop your hoes, foolish folk Drop your knives, foolish folk Save your strength for your own plots Save your breath for your own crops Why break your backs for Leopard?” Get story active!

You normally go to the orchard on Sunday afternoons.” MaMiya told him in a plastic packet, tucked the packet into her pocket and went straight to Azola and that she wanted to make apple juice to go with their supper.
Mabhako smiled.
He Mbalentle’s mother.

“MaDlamini!
MaDlamini!” MaMiya shouted at the door.
In the orchard MaMiya chose the biggest, greenest, juiciest apples.
She put ten of them “Hayibo, mfazi!
I’m not deaf.
What’s the matter?” asked MaDlamini, as she reached the in her basket, put the basket on her head and walked home.
door.
“MaMiya, why are you shouting?” MaDlamini invited MaMiya into the house.
As soon as she sat down, MaMiya got straight to the point.
“Mfazi, your children have wronged me,” she said.
“I went to get some apples from the orchard.
On my way home, I did not notice that my basket had a hole in it, and that six of my apples had fallen through the hole.
I’ve just found out that your children picked up the apples I lost and ate them all.” MaDlamini could not believe it.
She wanted proof of what her children had done.
MaMiya explained that Mabhako had seen them, and she showed her the cores that they had found lying under the tree.
“I’m really disappointed, mfazi.
That is not how I raised my children,” sighed MaDlamini.
“Maybe that is why they have been so scarce today.
Let me call them.” And with that she shouted for Azola and Mbalentle to come out of their bedroom.
When the two girls slowly appeared, she asked angrily, “You two, why did you steal “We did not know they were hers, Mama,” said Mbalentle.
“Then how do you explain just eating something that you picked up off the ground?
I believe you knew exactly whose apples they were!” MaDlamini apologised to MaMiya and promised to deal with the girls a little later.
When MaMiya got home, she made juice with the remaining apples.
That afternoon, MaDlamini arrived at MaMiya’s home with her girls.
Azola and Mbalentle apologised to MaMiya and to Mabhako for stealing the apples.
As part of the Mabhako was waiting for his mother by the gate.
He was singing a song, “We are apology they were to help Mabhako clean the chicken run and the pigsty for a week.
going to drink fresh juice, we are going to drink fresh juice, iyho, yho, yho!” MaMiya accepted their apology and everyone was happy.
He saw two of his friends, Azola and her sister, Mbalentle, walking behind his mother.
Then MaMiya took her deliciously cold apple juice from the fridge, and served it along The girls were carrying something in their T-shirts.
They were singing a song of their with some steamed bread.
Everyone ate and drank, and so by the end of the day there own, “We are going to eat scrumptious cold apples, we are going to eat scrumptious was peace and harmony between the neighbours again.
Mabhako, who was looking forward to his mother’s apple juice, ignored them.
They pulled funny faces at him and laughed.
Then they went to sit under the big tree near the taxi stop.
Inside the house, MaMiya got a shock when she looked in the basket.
“Mabhako, I know I picked ten apples!
But what has happened?
There are only four apples here.” Mabhako checked his mother’s basket and noticed that it had a hole big enough for an apple to fall through.
“I will walk back the way I came from the orchard,” sighed MaMiya.
“Maybe I will find my apples along the path.” After MaMiya had left, Mabhako remembered Azola and Mbalentle singing about eating apples.
He hurried to the big tree.
There they were, lying on their backs and eating green apples that looked really tasty!
There were only three apples left now.
Mabhako was very disappointed in his friends.
Instead of telling his mother about the apples that were falling from her basket, they had kept the fruit for themselves.
He ran to the orchard to let his mother know what had become of her apples.
MaMiya was already on her way back, huffing and puffing.
“Son, I could not find the apples.
Let’s just go back home,” she said sadly.
“I know what happened to them, Mama!” said Mabhako, and he told her what the girls had done.
“Let me show you where they are,” he said.

Valentine’s Day Most people know that Valentine’s Day is a day where you show your love for others, but do you know the story behind this day?
The day gets its name from a priest called Valentine who lived in the Roman Empire a very long time ago.
The emperor had banned marriage because he wanted a powerful army and he thought that married men were bad soldiers.
Valentine felt this was unfair, so he broke the rules and arranged marriages in secret.
When the emperor found out, Valentine was thrown in jail and sentenced to death.
There, he fell in love with the jailer’s daughter and when he was taken to be killed on 14 February, he sent her a love letter signed “from your Valentine”.
We will be taking a break until the Enjoy our special Valentine’s Day poster (page 2) and activity (page 13)!

with books!
Reading club corner During the school holidays children are able to relax and have a change of routine.
So, school holidays are a good time to get children hooked on reading, or to keep them in the habit of reading for enjoyment!
Running a holiday programme is an excellent way of doing this.
The Diaconia-Nal’ibali partnership in the Western Cape has been investing in holiday programmes for children in the Parow and Brackenfell areas.
We found out some more about these programmes to share with you.
Why did you start these programmes?
We wanted to provide safe places for children to be during the school holidays while their parents are working.
We also wanted to find a way to build bridges between the children in different communities in these areas because they don’t usually have contact with each other.
And of course, we wanted to let children experience the satisfaction of reading for enjoyment.
How old are the children?
The average age is 10 years old, but the programme is open to children aged 2 to 16 years.
Where are the programmes held?
In church halls and community halls.
What happens during a typical day?
Our holiday programmes run from Monday to Friday (9 a.m. to 1 p.m.) for one week.
Stories are the focus of what we do.
We spend time each day reading a Bible story and another story to the children and discussing these together.
Then we do some story-related activities and some teambuilding activities in which the children have fun working together to solve a problem.
Every day we also play a few games with the children and we always end with a picnic lunch!
Besides developing children’s interest in reading, the Diaconia-Nal’ibali holiday programmes have seen other positive spin-offs.
Friendships have formed amongst some children and the children have started socialising with each other.
Story sharing really is a great way of connecting with others!

As part of this, children were asked to write about the importance of school libraries.
Here is what Caleb Klaasen from Dalweide Primary Our library I love to read.
My belief is that reading expands one’s knowledge.
At our school, we recently re-opened our library.
It is filled with bright colours and dreams.
Each book that we are issued is either educational or adventurous.
The books are so neatly packed that when you enter the library, you already know which book you are going to take.
Informational books tell us about history.
When I want to prepare for a history or geography task, I take out a book related to it.
Story books are an adventure on its own.
A library is really a magical place.
When our library first opened, I was so excited.
I have fallen in love with reading again and again.

Tell a story!
Tell a Story Day on 27 April 2020, celebrates storytelling of all kinds – stories read aloud from books, stories that are told, as well as stories acted on stages, in movies and in puppet shows.
Read our tips below for telling stories to your children, and enjoy our special puppet-show activity on page 2!
Choose a time of day which works best for you all.
Some children enjoy listening to stories at bedtime, but others find it easier to concentrate during the day.
The children need to feel comfortable and have something soft to sit on.
It shouldn’t be too noisy, so that they can hear easily.
Choosing stories that you know well, helps you to tell them with confidence.
Also make sure that the stories are suitable for your children’s ages.
ka boitshepo.
Gape netefatsa gore mainane a tshwanela HOW TO TELL A STORY 1.
Before you tell the story, ask questions connected to the story and your children’s experience of the world.
This helps to spark their interest.
2.
Don’t talk too fast when you tell the story.
Children need time to think about what they are hearing.
3.
Put lots of expression in your voice to create the mood, and use a different voice for each character when she/he speaks.
4.
Use body gestures and actions.
For example, if the character is cross and stomping around, stamp your feet as you tell the story.
comments, for example, “What do you think will happen next?” and “I wonder how she felt while she hid in the forest.” These help children think about the story and 6.
After you have told the story, encourage your children to share any questions or comments they may have.
Try to find answers to their questions together.
The benefits of stories Research shows that:  introducing children to stories and books at home before they start school helps them to do better at school.

Get creative!
Using puppets is a great way to get children to retell the stories you have read to them, and to encourage them to make up their own stories!
Here are some suggestions for how to create a puppet show.
Follow the instructions for making stick puppets of the Nal’ibali characters or let your children create their own story characters.
Cut out the pictures of the Nal’ibali characters on page 3 or use the characters you have collected in past editions of the supplement.
(If your children are creating their own story characters, let them draw a picture of each character.)
Paste each picture on a sheet of paper or thin cardboard so that in doesn’t tear.
a bona, ba letle go thala ditshwantsho tsa modiragatsi Cut out each picture.
Find a thin stick (about as long as a ruler) for each character – you could use kebab sticks or any stick you find outside.
Use glue or tape to attach the end of a stick to the back of each picture.
Glue a small piece of paper over the end of the stick on the back of each picture.
Make a puppet theatre Find a large, rectangular cardboard box.
Open the flaps at one end of the box.
This is where you will get inside the box.
On the front of the box, make a flap by cutting along the bottom and sides of a rectangle.
The hole you cut will be the stage and you can use the flap to open and close the stage.
Get inside the box with your stick puppets.
Use them to tell your own stories.

When he went to art college after he finished school, he discovered that he could create books!

And that’s how Priddy Books was born.
Today it is part of Macmillan Publishers.

In December 2019, Priddy Books together with Pan Macmillan South Africa gave away thousands of Priddy books to different South African reading organisations, to help ensure that more children have the chance to grow up with books.
“It was important for us to choose books that appeal to South African children and especially the children at the Nal’ibali reading clubs.
So, we chose a range of first concept books in English, isiXhosa and isiZulu as well as a wonderful book about South African animals.
These books are easy for parents to read and talk about with their children,” Ka Sedimonthole 2019, Priddy Books gammogo le Pan Macmillan South On 6 December 2019, Roger Priddy visited a Nal’ibali reading club in Soweto to read some of his books to the children there.

“I’ve got a bunch of flowers for Gogo Moeng.
Can I come too?” “Of course,” said Momma and off they marched.
The bunch of flowers made Valecia sneeze, “Achoo!

Momma Moeng’s surprise Momma Moeng sets out to surprise Gogo Moeng on her birthday.
She carries the jar of jam she made on her head, and ties Baby Beka and his blue balloon to her back.
Along the way, they meet many more well-wishers, and Momma Moeng ends up heading a noisy, colourful procession carrying piles of presents to Gogo.
When they finally get to Gogo’s house, there is a short pause, but then the party really gets going!

Then Baby Beka found his best blue balloon.
He wanted to give it to Gogo for her birthday.
Momma tied Baby Beka to her back with a soft blanket.
Then she put the jar of jam on her head and off she marched to Gogo Moeng’s house.
Baby Beka’s balloon went bobbity-bob and Momma’s slipslops went pliff-ploff, pliff-ploff down the dusty path until she met Sipho coming out of the Tip-Top shop.
“Where are you going, Momma Moeng?” asked Sipho.
“Baby Beka and I are going to Gogo Moeng’s house.
It’s her birthday today,” replied Momma.
“I’ve got a packet of crispy potato chips for Gogo Moeng.

“Of course,” Momma smiled and off they marched.
“Where are you all going, Momma Moeng?” Mr Sithole asked.
“We’re going to Gogo Moeng’s house.
It’s her birthday,” she replied.
“I have a trolley full of vegetables for her,” said Mr Sithole.
“Please could you give it to her?” “Of course,” answered Momma.
But now Momma had a BIG problem − there was too much to carry!
She had to think of a plan.
First, she took Baby Beka off her back and then tied the chubby chicken onto her back with the soft blanket.
Baby Beka SCREAAAAMED!
So, Momma put the chubby chicken on top of the trolley and tied Baby Beka onto her back with the soft blanket.
Baby Beka was happy and the chubby chicken was very happy to peck at all the vegetables.
But Momma wasn’t happy with this so she put the chubby chicken on Valecia’s head.
The feathers tickled Valecia’s nose and made her sneeze even more, “AAAAA-CHOOOOO!” Valecia wasn’t happy.

“What if we sing Mama’s song?” Yellow suggested.
“Mama always said that if we sing her song, she will find her way back to us.” Nonyane.
Ke ole a fofa.
A long time ago, in the forest of Happy-Land, birds and trees could talk to each other.
And from then on, birds have always sung Mama Bird found her way back to HappyLand and soon rain started to fall again.
But one day, drought set in on the land.
Rivers dried up and leaves fell off the trees.
“But I don’t know how to sing!” cried Pink.
Mamango thought long and hard.
“Maybe we should fetch the magic worm that brings rain.
But who will go?” “Have you tried singing?” asked Mamango.
“I have tried singing,” said Yellow.
“I can teach you.” Mama Bird’s voice was beautiful!
She would wake up early to sing her song.
Eventually, all the birds joined Yellow Early the next morning, Yellow sang Mama’s song, “It’s a beautiful morning!
We wake up and sing!” There was a bird family with three children: Blue, Pink and Yellow.
They all lived in a big wise tree called Mamango.
le masomearobedi kgotsa masomearobonngwe a botsalo When she opened it everyone started singing a happybirthday song.
On the table were the vegetable pie and jam tarts that Momma had made, newly laid eggs from the chubby chicken, the special birthday cake and the crispy potato chips.
The table was decorated with flowers and Baby Beka’s beautiful blue balloon.
Gogo.
And she should know, because Gogo had already had at least eighty or ninety birthdays before this one!
So, Momma took the chubby chicken and put it on Sipho’s head and she gave him Valecia’s flowers to hold.
Now Valecia had two hands free to hold the cake.
And Momma had two hands free to push the trolley.
Everyone was happy and off they marched to Gogo Moeng’s house.
The wheels of the trolley went squeak-squeak-squeak.
Valecia had icing from the cake on her cheeks so her tongue went slurp-slurp-slurp.
Baby Beka mumbled, “Nummy, nummy, num-num.” The chubby chicken went chuk-chuk-chook, chuk-chuk-chook, the packet of crispy potato chips went crinkle-crinkle, Baby Beka’s balloon went bobbity-bob and Momma’s slipslops went pliff-ploff, pliff-ploff down the dusty path all the way to Gogo’s house.
“We must get a birthday cake for Gogo,” said Momma.
They went inside.
Ting-a-ling went the doorbell.
“Good morning, Mrs Makabelo.
Did you know today is Gogo Moeng’s birthday?” “Oh yes,” said Mrs Makabelo.
“I have baked a special cake for her, but I can’t leave the shop.
Could you take it to her?” “Of course,” offered Momma, but there was a problem − Momma needed two hands to carry the cake.
So, she made a plan.
She put the chubby chicken on top of the jar of jam that she was carrying on her head.
Now she had two hands to carry the special birthday cake.
Off marched Momma, Baby Beka and Sipho through the ting-a-ling door.
When Baby Beka smelt the cake he mumbled, “Nummy, nummy, The chubby chicken went chuk-chuk-chook, chuk-chuk-chook, the packet of crispy potato chips went crinkle-crinkle, Baby Beka’s balloon went bobbity-bob and Momma’s slipslops went pliff-ploff, pliff-ploff down the dusty path until they met Valecia.

“GOGO!

“GOGO!” Way down at the bottom of the steep hill Gogo said, “EE-EE-EE.
Someone is calling me.
Now I can’t go to the shops to buy my birthday supper.” Gogo turned round and walked all the way up the steep hill.
Her slippers went shuffle-shuffle on the dusty path.
Finally she reached the back door.
Sipho’s packet of crispy potato chips went crinkle-crinkle, Baby Beka’s balloon went bobbity-bob and Momma’s slipslops went pliff-ploff, pliff-ploff down the dusty path until they came to Mr Shabalala, who was feeding his chickens.
“Where are you going?” he asked.
“We’re going to Gogo Moeng’s house.
It’s her birthday,” answered Momma.
“I’ve got a chubby chicken for Gogo Moeng.
Can you give it to “Of course,” said Momma tucking the chubby chicken under her arm and off marched Momma, Baby Beka and Sipho.
The chubby chicken went chuk-chuk-chook, chuk-chuk-chook, the packet of crispy potato chips went crinkle-crinkle, Baby Beka’s balloon went bobbity-bob and Momma’s slipslops went pliff-ploff, pliff-ploff down the dusty path until they came to Mrs Makabelo’s home-bake shop.
Momma knocked on the front door.
Sipho whistled.
Valecia shouted.
But there was no reply.
Momma pushed the front door open and they all went inside.
But there was no one there.
They looked in the kitchen − nobody.
They looked in the bedroom − nobody.
They looked everywhere.
Where could Gogo be?
Momma said, “Let’s get cooking and maybe Gogo will turn up.” So that is what everyone did – everyone except Baby Beka.
He sat on the kitchen counter next to the window and watched until he saw Gogo walking way down the path at the very bottom of the ne ba re tshe-tshe-tshe-tshe mo tselaneng e e lerole go fitlhelela ba fitlha Mme ke seo batho botlhe ba neng ba se dira – batho botlhe kwa Get story active!

On your own or with a friend, write the newspaper report about Thato.
You may also want to draw a picture to go with your report!
Thato, the dreamer In Disteneng, just five kilometres from Polokwane, lived a girl named Thato.
Thato lived with her mother, Mokgadi, in a house made of poles and iron sheets – a mokhukhu.
Early in the morning, Thato’s mother would walk with her all the way to her primary “So what?” a few unkind children said.
“She sang for us on her birthday.
Now we will sing a song too: Thato, the mokhukhu girl, the dreamer.” Then they followed her around the schoolyard singing their unkind song.
“Thato, the mokhukhu girl, the dreamer.” Over and over again.
One morning as they passed the green shack on the corner, people were sitting But, things don’t stay the same forever.
When Thato turned nine, she could take part in school sports.
The first time her teachers saw her run, they knew that she would be a champion!
“Tlou stays here,” said Thato.
“He doesn’t come to school anymore.” “You must practise every day after school, Thato,” Mrs Sephuma said.
Every day, Mrs Sephuma would give Thato a sandwich and some fruit when the other children were not around.
Every day, Thato practised.
“Yes.
He said school is for rich people, not poor people,” Thato answered sadly.
“I miss him so much.
He was the only other child from Disteneng at school.” When it was the school sports day, Thato came first in all her races.
“Now you must run for the school!
You must help us win the sports competition this year,” said the principal as she gave Thato a big packet.
Then Thato ran ahead of her mother.
Further down the road, as they got closer to Ladanna, she heard the sound of birds.
In Disteneng, she only heard loud music.
Thato worked hard at school.
During break time, she always did her homework because it was difficult to do it at home.
But it was Grace’s birthday today and she had brought cupcakes for everyone in class.
Mrs Sephuma handed out the pretty little cakes to the children.
Slowly Thato ate a small piece of her cake.
It had chocolate icing on top and tasted sweet.
It made Thato think about her last birthday.
She had not brought cakes, but had sung a song for the class.
The teacher had loved it, but not the children.
Some of them had sulked, while others said, “Mokhukhu girl!
Hey, mokhukhu girl – the one who sees electricity across the river – where’s our cake?” Thato didn’t open the packet until she got home, but as soon as her mother had closed the door, Thato opened it.
Inside was a pair of running shoes, running shorts and a T-shirt.
Thato ran even faster in her running shoes.
It wasn’t long before the same children who had called her mokhukhu girl started calling her the bullet girl.
“There goes the bullet girl!” they would shout as she sped past them on the sports field.
And at all the races they cheered her on, chanting, “Run, Thato, the dreamer, run.
Run, As she thought about that, Thato did not feel like eating her cupcake anymore.
She wrapped what was left of it in some paper and put it in her schoolbag.
Then she took out her writing book and started doing her homework.
After two years of training every day and eating the extra food that Mrs Sephuma brought to school for her, Thato became one of the fastest runners in Limpopo.
After school, Thato walked back home behind her mother.
As she got closer to the corner where the green shack was, she saw some children, white with dust from head to foot.
They were playing tshere and diketo – in the road.
One day Thato ran up to her mother as she waited at the school gate.
“Mom, mom!” she shouted.
“I’m on the Limpopo team!
I’m going to Cape Town with the team!” The principal gave Thato more packets.
There was one with running shoes and running clothes.
The T-shirts all had Limpopo’s emblem on them.
There was also a packet with a cap, jeans and a jacket.
And there was a small packet with a plastic bank card that had spending money for the trip to Cape Town.
When the time came for the Limpopo team to go to Cape Town, a big bus with soft seats and dark windows came to fetch Thato at her school.
She hugged climbed up the steps of the bus.
As she turned to wave standing next to her mother.
Behind him, stood her dusty “Here comes the schoolgirl,” said one of them pointing at Thato.
The children stopped playing.
The girls playing They looked at Thato in her school uniform that was too big for her.
Thato did not mind being called the schoolgirl.
It was better than the names she was called at school.
She remembered how they used to call her the school girl.
She smiled.
“You should come back to school,” she said.
Thato was the fastest one age group.
They wrote about her in the local newspaper and talked about her on the radio.
They called her a golden girl in waiting.
At school Thato was given a medal at assembly.
All the children and teachers clapped for her.
And they again, “Thato, the golden girl, the dreamer.” “She is back,” they all said together.
“You should come back to school,” said Thato.
“We can all go to school together.” “Go to school?” they laughed.
“Never!
You will find nothing there!” At school it was the same.
Sometimes Thato would be upset and cry.
Sometimes she would get angry and shout back, “My name is not mokhukhu girl!
It’s Thato!
Lucky you, who chose your parents!
If I was asked to choose, I would choose to live in a Some children laughed, but others said, “She is right.
We did not choose where we were born.
Thato is right.” And after that they only called her Thato.

through stories Have you thought how stories can offer a way of supporting children through some of life’s challenges?
As they grow, children are faced with a variety of situations.
Some of these may be exciting, like making new friends.
But very often they can be difficult and then children may need your help.
There are many wonderful stories about the challenging situations and events that children may face, such as starting school, separation, illness, the death of a loved one, divorce, prejudice and bullying.
HOW TO USE STORIES TO HELP 1.
Find a story that you like, with a character who has to deal with an issue that your child is facing, or one that might interest him or her.
Find a story that you like, with a character who has to deal with an issue that your child is facing, or one that might interest him or her.
Ask someone who knows storybooks well (like a librarian, bookshop assistant, teacher, counsellor or another parent) to help you choose, or look on the internet for 2.
Read and get to know the story yourself before sharing it with your child or a group of children.
3.
Think aloud and ask open-ended questions about the story during and after reading it to children.
Open-ended questions have no right or wrong answers and help children to reflect on, explore and talk about their concerns, feelings and ideas.
4.
Find some more ways, related to the story, for children to continue to explore their thoughts and feelings.
For example, children can: retell the story in their own way and/or act it out draw a picture about the story or that is inspired by it write a note or letter to one of the story characters tell and/or act out their own stories.
How would you feel if …?
If I were him, I wonder what I’d do … I wonder why she said/did that?
What do you think is going to happen next?
What would you do if …?
What do you do when …?
How stories can help When children discover story characters who have had similar experiences as they have, it helps them feel less alone and may also help them to better understand and cope with a challenging situation.
Many children find it difficult to identify and communicate how they are feeling.
Reading stories can help them understand themselves better and can give you all a great starting point for discussions.
Do you want to encourage the children in your class to keep reading and writing?
Here are two easy ideas to try!
 Invite the children to express their opinions about the books and Nal’ibali Supplement stories they have read.
Let them fold A4 sheets of paper in half and glue them together to make reading record cards.
Ask them to write their names at the top and to draw three columns.
Each week they can write the names of the books and stories they have read in the first column, and in the second column they can rate the book or story from 1–5 to show how much they enjoyed it.
Encourage them to write the reasons for their rating in the third column.
 Celebrate any writing that the children have done by asking them to read their stories or poems aloud to other children in your class or other classes.
If you can, also display their writing so that other children can read it at their leisure!
Reading club corner Choosing a name for your reading club is important because the name needs to inspire children to want to join the club – and then to keep coming back!
Ideas to include in your club’s name You could include any of the following ideas.
Ka jalo Reading Club  The name of the area in which your club meets.
 Words that rhyme or start with the same letter.
 Words that encourage children to believe in themselves.
 Words that describe the club members.
You could put two or more of these elements together to create a name for your club.
You could also ask the children for suggestions for a name for your reading club and then vote to choose the one that is the most popular.

nang le matlhare a a phepole le borekhu Temo and the plant thieves By Kgosi Kgosi  Illustrations by Magriet Brink and Leo Daly Temo was a clever young girl who lived in the village of Qunu.
She loved going to school and learning new things.
But there was a little problem: while no one was looking, the animals were starting to eat One day at school, her class learnt about planting and growing vegetables.
But there was a little problem: while no one was looking, the animals were starting to eat One day at school, her class learnt about planting and growing vegetables.
Temo was so fascinated by this idea that she could not wait to get home to tell her parents about it.
One day, when she came home from school, Temo found the goats feeding in her garden.
She chased them away and ran into the house.
“Mama!
Papa!
The goats are eating my vegetable plants.
Why didn’t you watch out for them?” she said, crying.
BRRRRING!
The last school bell of the day rang and all the children rushed out of their classrooms to make their way home.
When Temo arrived home, her mother and father were in the kitchen having tea.
So they went into the garden.
What a mess the goats had made!
But at least only a small part of the garden had been damaged.
“Mama!
Hello, Papa,” she said as she walked into the kitchen.
“Hello, Temo,” answered her parents.
“Let’s build a fence around the garden, Papa,” Temo suggested.
“How was your day at school today?” asked her mother.
“That’s a good idea!” Papa replied.
She chased them away and ran into the house.
So Temo and her father built a fence around the garden so the goats could no longer Temo’s parents wondered what their daughter was talking about, but before they could ask her to explain, she had disappeared.

The next day when she came home from school, Temo found the cows eating her plants.
The cows had been clever enough to open the garden gate with their horns!
In her bedroom, Temo took off her school uniform and put on her other clothes.
But these were not her everyday other clothes.
She put on her overalls, gumboots and a hat.
Temo tried to chase the cows away, but it only took one cow with large, sharp horns to look at her and she was terrified!
The cows looked so big!
So she ran into the house.
Temo walked back into the kitchen.
“Ta-da!
Mama and Papa, look!” she said.
Her parents were very surprised.
Temo never wanted to do any chores at home, so why was she suddenly dressed in work clothes?
“Why are you dressed like that, Temo?” her father asked.
“Mama!
Papa!
This time the cows are eating my vegetable plants,” she said.
“Because I want to start growing my own vegetables, Papa,” she said excitedly.
“So, you want to have your own garden here at home?” her mother asked.
Mama and Papa, look!” she said.
Temo and her father went outside and found the cows grazing in Temo’s garden.
Her father chased them away.
Temo’s parents looked at each other and wondered how Temo would manage to take care of a garden when she complained about chores as simple as making them tea.
But they decided to have faith in her anyway.
“That way the cows won’t be able to open the gate again.” So Temo and her father went outside and chose a piece of land in their yard where Temo could start her garden.
Then Temo’s father went inside to change into his overalls.
“That way the cows won’t be able to open the gate again.” So Temo and her father went outside and chose a piece of land in their yard where Temo could start her garden.
This helped make the soil soft for planting seeds.
Next, they raked all the unwanted weeds and stones from the soil.
Next, they raked all the unwanted weeds and stones from the soil.
Temo and her father put all the weeds into big black plastic bags and threw them into the dustbin.
Her father thought that was a good idea so they went and bought a padlock and they locked the gate.
The next day when Temo came back from school, she found not the goats, not the cows, but the birds eating the plants in her garden!
She chased them away and ran to tell her “Mama!
“Mama!
Papa!
Now the birds are eating my vegetable plants,” she cried.
The next day when Temo came back from school, she quickly changed out of her school uniform and went into her garden with her father.
Her father had bought some seeds for them to plant.
So, they planted and planted!
They planted spinach, carrot, tomato and bean seeds.
This helped make the soil soft for planting seeds.
The next day when Temo came back from school, she quickly changed out of her school uniform and went into her garden with her father.
Temo’s father went outside with her to see what the problem was.
Every day after that Temo was excited to come home from “I don’t know what to do now, Temo,” said her father scratching his head as he thought hard.
“I know what we can do,” said Temo quickly.
“We can put a net over the garden, then the birds won’t be able to get to the plants.” And Temo was right!
She never had to worry about any animals eating the plants in her garden again.
No goats could get in, no cows could get in and no birds could get in either.
The plants in her garden grew and grew, and soon the vegetables were ready for picking!
Temo’s mother cooked a tasty soup of beans, carrots, spinach and tomatoes and they all enjoyed a meal that had come from Temo’s garden.

Why a special edition?
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, children have not been able to go the library and reading clubs and have been away from school for a long period of time.
To support you as you do your best to keep your family safe, Nal’ibali has put together this special edition of our supplement to help you with ideas on how your children can continue reading and writing for enjoyment at home.
Some activities can be enjoyed by the whole family, while others have been divided into age groups to give you age-appropriate ideas.
HOW PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS CAN SUPPORT CHILDREN TSELA E BATSADI LE BATLHOKOMEDI BA KA Our first responsibility as parents and caregivers is to care for our children and to keep them safe.
This has been a difficult time for families across South Africa.
Your children may be feeling stressed or anxious at this time.
They may find it difficult to communicate their feelings with you, especially if you seem upset.
Try to do the following things to help them.
Use positive language when talking to your children.
Invite your children to tell you how they are feeling.
Do fun things together.
Let them help you by doing some of the chores.
One of the best ways for you to support your children is by sharing stories with them.
Here are some of the benefits of sharing stories.
Stories help you bond with your children.
When you tell or read stories to your children, it lets them know that they are important enough for you to make time for them.
Stories help develop their imagination and creativity.
Stories also help develop children’s language and thinking, especially when they hear or read stories in their home languages.
Stories often provide children with examples of how people meet the challenges they face.
Improve confidence and learning Encourage your children’s attempts to read and write by making positive comments without focusing on mistakes.
By giving them lots of support, you will develop their confidence and improve their learning.

Morongwa’s surprise By Lorato Trok  Illustration by Magriet Brink and Leo Daly A few days later Morongwa saw that her two brothers were a bit bored because of the lockdown.
“Hey, you two, I’ve got a plan!
Do you want to have fun?” asked Morongwa.
On the last day of school, just before the start of the holidays, Morongwa sat quietly at her desk listening to her teacher, Mrs Nchwe, tell the class about a new germ that had been found.
It was called the coronavirus and was making many people all over the world very sick.
Morongwa did not wait for their answer.
Instead she went straight to the corner of their small bedroom where Mama Maduo kept her magazines.
Morongwa chose a few magazines and laid them on the floor.
Next, she took out the scissors, crayons, glue and sheets of paper that their uncle had bought for them at the beginning of the school year.
As Lesedi watched his big sister, his eyes grew wide with excitement.
As she listened, Morongwa didn’t know what to feel.
The germ sounded really scary, but on the other hand, the president had announced that all schools would close earlier for the holidays.
The country was going into lockdown to keep people safe.
This meant a very long break from school, and that sounded good!
But Morongwa wasn’t sure what a lockdown was.
For the next few afternoons Morongwa, Ofentse and Lesedi locked themselves in their bedroom and had lots of fun cutting out pictures from magazines.
There was a lot of cutting and a lot of laughing!
During the next lesson, Morongwa sat quietly at her desk thinking about what Mrs Nchwe had told them.
She felt confused and worried.
Although her teacher had told them about the virus and the lockdown, Morongwa didn’t really understand everything.
It all sounded very serious.
“This is fun!” said a giggling Lesedi.
“Remember that it’s a surprise, Lesedi.
This is our holiday surprise mission,” said Morongwa, tickling Lesedi’s legs.
After a while, Morongwa raised her hand.
“Yes, Morongwa,” said her teacher.
Then, one evening after dinner, Mama Maduo was surprised to see her children lining up next to her.
Ofentse and Lesedi were each holding a sheet of paper and Morongwa was holding a book.
“What are those?” signed Mama Maduo.
“Mrs Nchwe,” Morongwa began, “I understand that there is a new virus that can make us all very sick and that is why schools are closing today.
But can you please explain more about the virus?
How does it make you sick?” “That’s a good question, Morongwa,” said Mrs Nchwe.
“Let me help you Mrs Nchwe put up a poster.
“First of all, if the coronavirus gets into your body, it may cause an illness called COVID-19.
The coronavirus can get inside your body when someone who has the virus sneezes or coughs near you.
The virus comes out of their mouth in small drops of water.
These drops can get onto your hands.
If you then touch your mouth, nose or eyes, the virus can get into your body and make you sick,” Mrs Nchwe explained.
“So how can we stop ourselves from getting the virus?” asked Morongwa.
“You have to wash your hands with water and soap as often as you can.
Slowly count to twenty while you wash to make sure your hands are clean.
You also have to stay at home.
You should stay away from everyone outside your home.
If you have to go outside, you must wear a mask,” said Mrs Nchwe.
Morongwa had more questions for her teacher.
She raised her hand again.
“Can my dog get sick, or could I make my dog sick?” she asked.
“It is our holiday surprise for you!” the children all signed together.
“Can we show you?” “Luckily, we can’t get the coronavirus from our pets, nor give it to our pets,” smiled It turned out that Morongwa had helped her brothers make picture stories for their mama as a surprise.
It was now time for show and tell!
Then she explained that the virus is passed from person to person.
“Anyone can get it from anyone, and anyone can give it to anyone,” she said.
“That is why the country is going into a lockdown.
Everyone must stay home and away from other people so that no one can make anyone else sick.” Lesedi went first.
He told the story about his picture and also used his little hands to do sign language so that Mama could follow his story.
And even though Lesedi’s story didn’t always make sense to Morongwa, it was funny and made everyone laugh.
Next, it was Ofentse’s turn.
He had cut out pictures of a beautiful mother and also two big bird wings.
Then he had glued the wings onto the mother’s shoulders.
“This is you, Mama,” he said pointing at his mother.
Then he signed, “You are our special superhero.” Just as Morongwa was starting to worry about how she was going to remember all these facts so that she could tell her mama and younger brothers, Mrs Nchwe handed out booklets to everyone.
“You can take these little books home to remind you about the important information we have shared today,” she said.
When it was Morongwa’s turn, she showed Mama the picture book she had made about a protective Mama Bear and her cubs.
She wanted to make sure Mama Maduo knew how much they loved her and how proud they were of their real-life Mama Bear.
Morongwa was putting her booklet safely into her school bag when the school By this time, Mama Maduo was crying tears of joy and gave all her children a big, happy bear hug.
The first thing Morongwa did when she got home was to wash her hands with soap and water.
“Ofentse, Lesedi, come join me,” Morongwa said when she saw her younger brothers watching her.
“Slowly count to twenty while you wash.” She signed to The children were happy too.
They had each made up a different story and told it in their own way.
And while they were doing this, they had completely forgotten about the lockdown!
“Lockdown?
What lockdown?” they all laughed.
“Why do we have to wash our hands, Morongwa?” Ofentse asked, his hands up in the air.
For Morongwa and her family the lockdown had become a happy time to discover new things and start new family traditions.
Mama Maduo’s magazine collection was now more valuable than ever.
The family’s new-found enjoyment of writing, reading and telling stories had become a fun-filled family adventure.
“Let’s just all wash our hands.
I will explain why later,” Morongwa said.
Mama Maduo was surprised by Morongwa’s change in attitude.
If there was one of her children who always had to be reminded to wash her hands, it was Morongwa.
It was good to see this change in her.
Mama Maduo smiled, but she was also a little confused about this change.
Over the next few weeks Mama Maduo, Morongwa, Lesedi and Ofentse created, read and told more and more stories.
This made Mama wonder whether perhaps the president had been thinking of Morongwa when he started his Thuma Mina (send me) Campaign to rebuild South Africa.
It seemed like that to Mama!
After all, in Setswana Morongwa’s name means “the one who is sent”.
That night Morongwa read the booklet that her teacher had given her to her family and explained to them what COVID-19 is.
Then she gave Mama Maduo the booklet to read.

They may also start to question why things are the way they are.

Talk about TV and books Watching TV helps children develop their critical thinking about what they watch, as well as what they read.
Ask them questions, not to test them, but to encourage them to express their opinions and thoughts on what they are watching and reading.
For example, you could ask: Did you enjoy the show/story?
Why or why not?
Which character did you like the most?
Why?
Which character did you dislike the most?
Why?
Do you think the story is believable?
Do these kinds of things really happen?
Write for a reason Invite your children to try these writing activities related to a book they have read, a story they have listened to or one of their favourite TV shows.
 Prepare an interview with one of the characters.
Write down at least ten questions that would give the character an opportunity to discuss their thoughts and feelings about their role in the story.
 Write a book review.
Make sure you provide information about the book’s setting and characters, and what the story is about – but don’t give away all the details!
Remember to also say what you liked and/or didn’t like about the book.
 Write a description of three characters from a story you have read.
Include these details: what they look like, what feelings they experience and how they relate to other characters.
Draw a picture of each character to go with the description.
 Write a short summary of the things you learnt from a story.
Read non-fiction books As they get older, some children may find that they enjoy non-fiction books as much as storybooks.
Non-fiction books will help them discover new places, things, people and events.
It will grow their vocabulary about specific topics and teach them practical skills.
Nonfiction books can also teach them words that are used specifically in science, mathematics, history and geography.

Ideas for teenagers Teenagers enjoy trying new things and being independent.
Even though it may not always seem like it, they appreciate it when you spend time with them, encourage them to do challenging activities and show an interest in the things that they enjoy.
Read, write and learn  Encourage writing.
Suggest that your teenagers keep a lockdown diary or write poetry to express their thoughts and feelings.
 Local history.
Let your teenagers do a history project with family members.
They can interview you and other adults at home about your early memories of where you grew up, events that happened and how these things affected you.
Encourage your teenagers to write down the interviewee’s answers or to use a cellphone to record the interview.
 Talk about the news.
Teenagers are bombarded with news from radio, television, WhatsApp groups and other social media.
As a family, practise being critical about the news so that teenagers can learn to work out what is true and what is false.
Here are some questions to ask.
From whose perspective is the story being told?
Who is speaking?
Who is being spoken about?
Who has power?
How is this power expressed?
What is left out and/or taken for granted?
Who benefits?
 Get reading.
Encourage your teenagers to read on their own and for their own enjoyment.
If they don’t have access to books, help them find FunDza’s online library at:  Read aloud.
Reading aloud is not only for young children!
It can be fun to read a story or script out loud to or with teenagers.
Find scripts to enjoy reading  Managing their studies.
Work out a daily routine with your teenagers so that they can keep to regular study times.
Also, encourage them to talk to you about what they are studying.
This will help them understand and remember what they have learnt.
In fact, one of the best ways of checking if you really understand something is to teach it to someone else.
So, ask your teenagers to teach you about a topic – in whatever language they prefer.

Learning to share As adults we know that being able to share is an important life skill, and part of this is learning to take turns with others.
When you regularly spend time reading with your children, not only do you develop them as readers, you also have an excellent opportunity to show them how to share and take turns.
sengwe sa botlhokwa thata mo botshelong, mme Taking turns helps you to create a partnership with your children around books.
It means that you can share the power to make decisions about what you will read and how to spend your reading times.
And so, exploring books becomes something you really do together!
Here are some ways in which you can share and take turns as you read together.
Take turns choosing books.
Sometimes invite your children to choose the storybooks you’ll read together.
At other times, you can choose a storybook that you’d like to read to them.
Take turns between reading your children’s favourite stories and sharing a book that none of you has read before.
Take turns telling each other stories.
Share “old” stories that you remember hearing before, or new ones that you have made up yourselves!
As you read books together, take turns “reading” the words.
Sometimes invite children who can already read, to read the words of one of the characters in the story.
Encourage children to join in when you read repeated phrases or sentences in a story.
For example, in the story, The three little pigs, the wolf repeatedly says, “I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house down.” Taking turns is not only for older children.
Get babies or toddlers involved in helping you read the story by asking them to turn the pages for you!
Invite children to share their opinions and ideas while you help them think about the stories you read together.
Ask questions like, “What do you think of …?”, “Why do you think they said/did that?” and “What would you have said/done if that were you?” Remember to allow your children to ask their own questions about the stories – and then work out the answers to their questions together.
At your reading club Take turns at your reading club.
Sometimes you can choose the book to read aloud to the children and at other times you can ask them to choose.
Always allow some time during your weekly reading club session for the children to choose books they want to look at and/or read on their own or in pairs.
This supplement is available during term times in the following Arena Holdings newspapers: Sowetan in the Free State, Gauteng, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and North West and The Herald in the Eastern Cape.
Reading club corner Holiday programmes provide opportunities for reading club members to continue enjoying and exploring stories during the school holidays.
They can also introduce other children to the joy of stories!
Here’s a countdown checklist to help you prepare for your holiday programme.
 Find a venue that is safe and has enough space.
 Find volunteers who can help you run the programme.
 Invite different authors, illustrators, storytellers and/or actors who could talk to the children and share stories with them.
 Speak to people at libraries and schools, and to individuals who can lend or donate books, magazines or stationery.
 Draw up a draft programme of activities for each day.
 Advertise the holiday programme at schools, libraries and local shops.
 Ask shops and members of the community to donate healthy snacks for the children to enjoy each day.
 Decide which stories will be told or read, which songs and games to use, and which activities and resources are needed for each day.
 With the volunteers, practise reading the stories and doing the programme activities so that you know how much time is needed for each.
 Finalise the programme.
 Have a sign-up day.
Make sure that parents/caregivers complete and sign all the necessary forms.
 Once you know how many children will be attending the holiday programme, decide how many resources you need for each activity.
 Start collecting the resources.
 Collect the rest of the resources you will need.
 Prepare anything special that you may need for the activities.
(For example, staple blank pages together for children to use to create their own storybooks.)
The day before  Prepare the venue!
Put up posters.
Create different activity areas, for example, use a blanket and cushions to create a reading area.
 Make sure that you have everything at the venue for the first day’s activities.
 Make sure that you have enough snacks and drinks, toilet paper and bin bags.

Book displays invite children to try out books!
They highlight the books that are available for them to choose from when they want to read.
Display books that you want the children to notice.
These may be books related to a particular holiday, celebration or a theme.
Or, create a display of books that have been read and reviewed by the children!
 Display books in all the languages the children speak.
 Include the books that you have read aloud so that the children can explore these on their own and with friends.
 The display needs to be at the children’s head height so that they can see and reach the books easily.
 Keep the display interesting and fresh by changing the books as part of a later display.)
Besides using traditional bookshelves or a small, low table, there are other attractive ways to create a book display.
For example:  Hang picture books over a washing line strung low from one side of the classroom to the other.
 Make bookshelves from plastic guttering attached to a wall and display books on these.
mo leboteng mme o bontshe dibuka mo go yone.
 Use an old kitchen dish-drying rack and display some of the books in the slots usually used for plates.
If you are unable to create a permanent display, then create a display area that can easily be packed away.
Place a large piece of fabric, a carpet offcut or an old tablecloth on the floor and spread out the books you want to display on this.
Make sure the front covers of the books are facing upwards.

Connect with stories Every day, people reach out to others to bring about positive change.
A small act of kindness and love – like taking the time to read to someone or tell them a story – can make a big difference in their life.
Stories allow us to make sense of our own lives and to connect with family and friends.
Sharing stories helps children to do more than just learn to read; it builds a sense of belonging to their families and communities and also helps them understand others.
STORIES MAKE A DIFFERENCE When we read to our children or tell them stories, we are helping to shape them.
Here’s how.
Sharing stories helps you bond with your children.
Stories help develop their imagination and creativity.
Stories help develop children’s language and thinking, especially when they hear or read stories in their home languages.
Stories provide children with examples of how people meet the challenges that they face.
Children who enjoy being read to at home, are more likely to be motivated to read themselves.
When children are motivated, they learn more easily.
Here are some of the things you can do at home to help make South Africa a reading nation.
Read aloud regularly.
All you need is 15 minutes each day to read aloud to your children.
Suggest books.
Talk to your children about which kinds of books and stories they like.
Then help them find the ones they want, preferably in their home language/s.
Write a review.
Encourage your children to write a book review of their favourite book.
Then display their reviews for others to read, or send them to Nal’ibali to publish on our website.

Stories at home Reading and telling stories can be two of the most satisfying activities for children, especially if they are stuck inside to keep safe, or because it is raining or they are sick.
The magic of books and stories will let them go on places without leaving home.
Reading to our children shows them that reading can be enjoyable and entertaining.
This motivates them to read more and more.
And this is how they develop a lifelong relationship with books and reading!
Helping children understand how stories work, can be fun.
When they act out a story in their own way, they deepen their understanding of it.
Here are some ideas for playing with stories.
After reading or listening to a story, encourage your children to act it out.
Let them choose which character they want to be.
Then help them find hats, jackets and other clothes to dress up as the characters.
Find ways to create different story props, for example, place chairs one behind the other, like seats on a bus or taxi.
Let the children use their own words to act out the story.
letle go itlhophela gore ba batla go tsaya maemo a modiragatsi ofe.
Ba thuse With your children, listen to an audio story from the “Story resources” section of the Nal’ibali’s website (www.nalibali.org).
Let your children listen carefully to how the actors use their voices to show their feelings.
CREATE STORIES Let your children create stories by changing a story they know, in one of these ways.
Let them make up a different ending for their favourite story.
Ask them to add a new character or event to a story.
The character or event should fit in with the rest of the story.
They can also use the characters from a story to create a new story of their own.
Draw, write, tell When children are able to do the following things after reading a story, it shows that they have understood what they read.
They are able to draw a picture about something that happened in the story.
They can write something that is linked to the story, such as a poem, a letter or a diary entry.
They can retell the story using their own words.

Get creative!
When your children’s school or preschool is closed, do you sometimes wonder how to keep your children learning while they have fun?
Don’t worry – this is a great opportunity to grow the culture of reading and writing in your home!
But what happens if you run out of stories to read?
Well, we all have lots of our own stories to tell.
And because stories are best when they are shared, a story that is written together with others is a great way to share a story!
Follow the steps below to create a story with 1.
Together, make a list of what the story could be about.
Get ideas from pictures, poems, stories you have read or something that has happened to you.
2.
Choose one idea to use for your story.
3.
Talk about the characters you will have in your story.
Stories usually have a few characters, but there is always a main character.
The main character could be: a special or an ordinary person motho yo o kgethegileng kgotsa motho fela young or old a human, an animal or a make-believe character, like an alien or 4.
Decide how your story begins and then what happens next.
All stories need a beginning, a middle and an ending.
Include things in your story that would make it interesting to read or listen to.
5.
Use interesting language to describe what the characters see, hear, smell, taste and touch.
6.
Your story needs a series of steps that build up to a big surprise or discovery.
This is the part of the story that makes a reader or listener think, “Wow!” 7.
After this, you need to find a way for your story to end well.

Pagolola Earlier this year, when schools were closed because of the coronavirus, I was worried about how to keep my two children from getting bored.
I went on the Nal’ibali website and found lots of ideas, so I decided to make a reading corner in our house.
I put some colourful cushions in a corner of the lounge.
Then I put some magazines, books and story cards that I printed from your website in the corner too.
I went there to read a few times and was very happy to see my children reading there too!
They love the reading corner so much that it has become a permanent feature in our home.
Thank you, Nal’ibali!
The Nal’ibali Supplement The Nal’ibali Trust Waverley Business Park Wyecroft Road It is wonderful to hear that you have made a place for books and stories in your home.
There is really nothing better than for families to read together!
The Nal’ibali Team Here is my review of What’s at the park?
(in Edition 164) by David Mann and Jess The story is about a little girl called Zoey, who loves going to the park with her grandmother.
Zoey is able to see many things at the park, while her granny is able to hear many things.
The author wrote, “Granny needs glasses to see.
But she can hear very well.” While they are at the park Granny hears a loud sound and Zoey tells her it is a dog.
The dog is dirty and smelly.
The dog follows them to their house, and Zoey washed it.
This story is similar to the one called Dog (in Edition 161) that tells us how dogs started living with humans.
The book is a good book because it teaches us to help each other and love one another.

It wasn’t long before everyone was moving to the music and when the song finished, there was more clapping and cheering.
“Next, some monkey jokes,” boomed Bad-tempered Baboon.
Some of the monkey jokes were funny, some of them were not.
And some of them were just confusing.
Still, the animals clapped and cheered for the monkeys.
The animals were feeling better now.
They had forgotten about being hot and thirsty.
They were waiting for Rosie to do her ballet.
That would surely be the funniest sight ever!
At last, after the Impala family’s play and the acrobatics from Gorata and Moses, Badtempered Baboon announced, “And now, the final act of our Kalahari concert – our very own ballerina, Rosie Rhino!” Onto the stage stepped Rosie.
She had wildflowers tucked behind her ears.
She had some pink material, that sort of looked like a skirt, tied around her large tummy.
“Go, Rosie, go!” the audience yelled.
The monkeys were falling about, laughing again.
Rosie didn’t care – her dream was coming true.

That’s when she had a wise idea.
“A concert!” announced Mama Elephant.
“Yes, we will hold a Kalahari concert!” The mood changed at once.
Everyone forgot about being hot and thirsty.
They were too busy planning their acts for the concert.
“The impalas will put on a play,” said Itseng.
“It will be about family – about how lovely it is to have lots of cousins and aunts and uncles!” “Moses and I will do an acrobatic show,” said Gorata.
“Moses can do amazing tricks climbing up my neck and sliding down again.” The other monkeys wanted to tell jokes.
There were arguments while they decided who their best joke-teller was.
Mama Elephant trumpeted above the noisy monkeys, “My sister and I will play some music with our trunks.
And you, Rosie?
What will you do in our Kalahari concert?” Beside the thorn-tree, Rosie felt shy.
There was only one thing she wanted to do, only one thing she dreamed of.
Everyone stopped laughing.
“Ballet,” she answered softly.
“Ballet-dancing!” In silence, they stared at the spot where Rosie had landed.

Join us and Welcome to your special World Read Aloud Day edition of the Nal’ibali Supplement!
World Read Aloud Day is celebrated by people from all over the world who are passionate about children’s books and reading.
In fact, it’s celebrated by over one million people in more than one hundred countries!
Every year Nal’ibali joins in these celebrations to raise awareness in our own country of how reading aloud supports children’s literacy development.
Each year on World Read Aloud Day, people get together to read stories to each other.
It’s a day where we turn the spotlight on sharing the power of stories with each other so that we create communities of readers.
Adults read stories to children, older children read to younger children, and some children even read to adults they know who love hearing them read, or are not able to read themselves.
And this all happens in different places: in homes, schools, preschools, libraries, community centres, old age homes, churches, temples, mosques and bookshops!
But, the simple act of reading aloud on this day is about more than just people sharing stories they enjoy.
It also shows our children and others around us that: we think reading is important.
we are committed to helping children become readers by reading aloud to them regularly.
we believe that everyone has the right to learn how to read!
On Nal’ibali’s first World Read Aloud Day celebration in 2013, 13 401 children were read to and this number has just kept growing year after year!
Last year was our eighth World Read Aloud Day and 2 925 224 children across South Africa were read to.
And this year, on 3 February, we want to reach even more children.
Find out how you can help us do this on page 2.
On World Read Aloud Day, we hold hands with others to create a global literacy movement.
Reading aloud on this special day is a symbol of our commitment to the power of literacy, and also a very practical way of showing everyone that reading matters.
Join us this World Read Aloud Day and share a story!

“If we were flying, we would have been at Gogo’s house long ago.” “I know,” said Mama, “but please put your arms down before you poke your fingers in someone’s eye.” “Eish, this bus is so slow,” sighed Afrika.

The tale of Oxpecker and Buffalo By Kai Tuomi  Illustrations by Samantha van Riet In the old days, Oxpecker had a bright yellow bill.
He lived in a little hut in a “How are you going to stop me?
Look at how big I am.
And because you’re patch of long grass.
Each day he would sweep his hut before setting off into being so rude, I’ve decided that I’m going to eat and eat and eat until I’m full.” the grass to catch his favourite food.
At night he would climb into his nest- And with a loud MUNCH!
CRUNCH!
Buffalo started to eat.
bed, his belly full of green grasshoppers, flies and wriggly worms.
This made Oxpecker so angry that the end of his beak turned bright red.
If anyone came into the patch of long grass, Oxpecker would fly up and shout Oxpecker flew around Buffalo’s head shouting and shrieking and whooping, at them.
He would peck them and make a fuss until they went away.
He liked but Buffalo just kept on eating.
Soon all the long grass was gone.
To to live alone, and he didn’t want to share with anyone.

“That’s not going to work,” said Buffalo.
“My skin is very thick.
Even Lion “What now?” shrieked Oxpecker, flying up out of the long grass to get a has tried to bite me with his sharp teeth and I got away.
You are too small, Oxpecker.
And you deserved what you got.
I was willing to share.” A big, black animal with heavy horns was walking through the long grass.
“Well, that’s it then,” said Oxpecker growing suddenly quiet.
“I was only angry and rude because that was my home.
Now I have no home and no food – all those delicious green grasshoppers, flies and wriggly worms that lived in the long grass are gone!
Everything’s gone.” Buffalo looked back at Oxpecker, who was crying, and then to the bare patch of earth and the broken hut.
“I’m sorry I destroyed your home,” he said, “but maybe I can make it up to you.
I have a problem with insects, you see.
I mean, just take a look at my back.
There are always far too many insects hanging on and crawling all over me.
You could eat them, and it would be really nice to have someone finally get rid of them for me.” Oxpecker looked up and down Buffalo’s body and noticed all the little insects clinging to Buffalo’s skin.
The bird’s tummy rumbled, but the thought of doing Buffalo a favour after everything he had done, made Oxpecker angrier and angrier.
His yellow bill grew redder and redder.
“First you ate all my lovely grass!” shouted Oxpecker.
“Then you wrecked my house.
You actually put your big hoof right through the roof!
Now you want me to eat all these insects as a favour!” He walked up and down Buffalo’s back, “Hello,” said Buffalo.
“I haven’t eaten anything in weeks.
This long grass is pecking at the insects as he talked.
“You really are the worst, Buffalo!
As if I exactly what I need.
May I have some?” would help you,” he said with his little mouth full of insects.
“No!
Go away!” shouted Oxpecker.
“Well, I’ll die if I don’t eat something.
There hasn’t been any rain for months.
This is the only patch of long grass around here.
Won’t you let me eat some of it, please?” “Didn’t you hear me?
Go away!” said Oxpecker flying around Buffalo’s head.
“But you don’t even eat grass,” Buffalo said.
And then he tried again, “We could share the grass.” “I don’t share!
This is mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Now go away!” shouted Oxpecker.
Buffalo’s forehead wrinkled and his eyes narrowed to slits.
He got so angry that his tail swished back and forth, making a loud clapping sound as it struck the sides of his rump.
“Well, if you are going to be rude, I’m going to eat it anyway.
I eat grass, that is what I do, and I am hungry, so here I GO, you rude bird,” said Buffalo about to chomp on some grass.
Buffalo simply shrugged and walked off with Oxpecker riding on his back, shouting and eating insects.
And they are still doing that to this day, but “You wouldn’t dare!” shrieked Oxpecker.
Oxpecker never forgave Buffalo, and his yellow beak stayed red forever.

Read in your language!
We all have at least one language that we understand and communicate best in, although some of us may have more!
People use different labels for this language − like “mother tongue” or “mother language” or “home language” − but it is the language we learnt first.
It’s the language we think and feel in, the one in which it is easiest for us to express ourselves and communicate with others.
From birth, children hear language around them.
First they understand it and then they start to use it themselves.
In fact, by the time they are five years old, children’s brilliant young brains have helped them learn how to think and communicate in their home language.
But they do still need plenty of opportunities to hear and use their language so that they know it well enough to learn increasingly difficult concepts and skills.
It is really an essential and powerful part of learning language and developing literacy.
When you read to children regularly in their home language/s, you give them a strong language foundation that makes all learning easier.
If you don’t understand what you are reading, then you are not really reading – no matter how well you can say the words on the page!
So, because understanding is at the heart of reading, children need to listen to stories being read in their home language.
They can then concentrate completely on the flow of the story instead of struggling to understand a language they don’t know well yet.
Good stories are full of creative language that stimulates our imaginations and gets us thinking about how to solve problems.
Authors carefully pick words and phrases that unlock the worlds they are creating for their readers.
Like a hearty soup provides goodness to nourish our bodies, reading great stories provides goodness to nourish our minds.
They inspire children to read in their home language and then, later on, to learn to read stories in other languages too.

Younger readers often choose a book because they like the illustration on the front cover!
So, how do you choose books for children?
More experienced readers might choose a book that is on their favourite subject or by their favourite author.
Get to know your local librarians and ask them which authors children of a particular age  Books for babies and pre-schoolers should be in their home language, where possible.
Check with your children’s friends what they have enjoyed reading or ask other parents what their children are reading at the moment.

 Wordless books are a great investment because you get the chance to tell a story to your children in your own way in any language you like – and then they can create their own stories with the books too.
Also, look out for home language books for older children – nothing beats reading a story in your own language!
Choose some books that reflect things that will be familiar to your children – for example, books in which the homes look like your children’s.

Develop a reading routine at home Making literacy part of your home.
If you regularly read and write with your children at home, you teach them that reading and writing are important, useful and enjoyable.
This helps make literacy learning easier for them.
Everyone at home has a role to play in developing young children’s reading and writing.
Here are some ideas to make literacy an enjoyable part of everyday family life.
CREATE A STORY ROUTINE Set aside time every day to read and/or tell stories.
Many children enjoy listening to stories at bedtime, but some children may find it easier to concentrate at other times in the day.
Choose a time of day that works best for all of you.
Spend just 15 minutes a day reading storybooks aloud to your children.
Make it a relaxed and enjoyable time.
When your children realise that stories can be found in books, and that books are full of magical pleasure, they will try to read for themselves.
Good readers at school are often the ones who read at home with family and friends.
THINGS TO DO AT STORY TIME Tell your children stories, sing songs and recite poems you know.
This stimulates their imagination and develops their language.
Listen to their stories and remember to show your appreciation.
Use your home language.
Firstly, stories should be in your children’s home language.
Children should read and write in their home language before they learn to do this in other languages.
A strong foundation in their home language is the key to all successful learning – including learning to read and write − because to learn well, they need to understand well.
Children learn more from watching what we do than from what we tell them to do!
Let your children see you reading for pleasure and to find information, for example, when you read books, recipes, school notices, magazines and newspapers.

You can’t discover the joy of reading without having good books to read!
 Children aged 2 to 5 years mostly enjoy picture books – stories that have pictures and accompanying text that can be read in one sitting.
 Babies and toddlers often like books with big, bold, colourful pictures and few words in them.
They also like simple stories with pictures and short sentences, and books with rhymes.
Flap books and books with different textures, or that make a sound when you press something, will lead to many fun moments when you read together.
Books made of cloth and board are often the most practical because babies like to chew, pat, hit, drop, and even occasionally throw books!
 Children aged 2 to 5 years mostly enjoy picture books – stories that have pictures and accompanying text that can be read in one sitting.
Stories can be about everyday life or about the imaginary worlds of kind or cruel queens, fairies, dragons and animals that talk and act like people.
Children in this age group also often enjoy some simple informative books with lots of clear and interesting photographs.
 Most children learn to read between the ages of 6 and 11 years.
Many still enjoy picture books and especially enjoy trying to read books that were read to them when they were younger!
As they begin to read books, children often find particular authors whose books they enjoy − and then like to read all the books by this author!
Recipe books, craft books, other “how to” books, joke books and fact books seem to be popular with this age group.
 Children who are regular readers have usually developed an ability to choose books for themselves by the time they are twelve.
Suggest new authors to children of this age or suggest authors who write books on similar topics or in a similar style to the ones they have already read and enjoyed.
 Many teenagers enjoy books that focus on the challenges of growing up, while others prefer to escape into the world of fantasy!

WHICH BOOKS TO CHOOSE  Let your children select books that appeal to them.
Talk about stories Help your children make connections between the things they are reading about and real life.
Between the ages of six and nine, most children learn to read for themselves.
So, what can you do to help them develop as readers?
Well, the most important thing you can do is to keep reading to them!
Here are some ideas for doing that.
WHICH BOOKS TO CHOOSE  Let your children select books that appeal to them.
Children very often find an author, a type of story or a series they like, and this might inspire them to read more books.
 As they start to read on their own, help your children choose books that are not too difficult so that they are able to have lots of successful reading experiences.
 Keep more difficult books for you to read to your children.

Talk about stories Help your children make connections between the things they are reading about and real life.
For example, if they are reading about school, link it to their own experience of school.
More tips Sing songs, say tongue twisters (such as: red lorry, yellow lorry) and read rhymes together to get children used to the different sounds in words.
This helps them master the skills they need for their own reading and writing.
Create some opportunities for your children to read to you.

In preparation for World Read Aloud Day we once again produced a special story.
Sihle Nontshokweni, the author of Fly, Afrika, fly!, our 2021 World Read Aloud Day story, advertises the campaign.
For the past eight years, Nal’ibali has been celebrating World Read Aloud Day by calling on members of the public countrywide to read a story out loud to children in their home language.
Every year since 2013, when we held our first World Read Aloud goal to reach more children than the year before.
Despite the challenges of running the campaign during the COVID-19 lockdown, with libraries, schools and learning centres being closed, we have once again been able to reach more children than before.
Nal’ibali has set a new read-aloud record in South Africa after receiving pledges to read to 3 004 896 children on World Read The pandemic affected the way in which Nal’ibali ran the campaign this year.
This year our story was, Fly, Afrika, fly!, written by Sihle Nontshokweni and illustrated by Magriet Brink and Leo Daly.
Usually, we work with our partners to host read-aloud events at schools, community centres and libraries throughout the country.
Because of the lockdown and social distancing regulations, we had to change the way in which we approached the campaign.
Instead of huge events, we encouraged one-onone or small group readings between caregivers and children at home.
“We were cautious about this new approach, but ultimately, it is the type of reading behaviour that are their children’s first teachers and supporting a simple routine of reading by using our free literacy resources means they can nurture a lifelong habit of reading with their children.” The more children read, the more they learn to love to read!

“Get that juggling cat,” shouted the one Brother Sly pointing at Theo.
The ice started to slide off the trolley and so did the fish.
Theo grabbed one fish, but the rest began to flop over the edge.
He grabbed another fish and another, flipping them up into the air.
“And that pig.” “The pig – what for?” shouted the other brother.
“OH NO!
What am I going to do?” said Theo.
“I have to warn everyone.” He tried to squeeze through the crowd, but nobody moved because the acts had started.
He ended up next to Papa Prawn’s fish shop.
The fish trolley was outside so Theo climbed onto it to get a better view.
He could just see Sheila’s head as she started to bounce as part of her act.

Underneath there was another poster.
This one said something quite different about the Brothers Sly.
It said that they were going to sell the animals.
In town, Main Street was crowded.
All kinds of animals had arrived to perform tricks: big animals, small ones, short and tall, those with feathers and those with fur.
Theo was stuck at the back and could not see what was going on.
He moved around the circus van.
As he did, he noticed the poster peeling off the side.
“Look at the poster.” Heads turned.
There was hush.
Everyone read the poster out loud: “Then that means we’re all safe,” said someone else.
Theo did not mind.
He wandered through the library searching the shelves.
There were pictures of animals doing all kinds of things.
It said: “Circus acts needed!
Speak to the Brothers Sly.” “I’m going home,” said Sheila, “to practice my bouncing.” “And we are going home to celebrate,” said the cats.
So each and every cat turned to go back to Cat Cottage.
Each and every cat that is, except Theo.
“Where are you going?” they asked him.
“I have to let the other cats know.” He rushed out of the library and saw a van driving down the street.
It had the same poster on the side.
“That must be the circus van!” he thought.
Everyone followed.
Everyone followed.
The Brothers scrambled to their feet.
“I’m going to be an acrobat, but I need a costume!
An acrobat cannot perform without a costume.” “You mean they wanted to trap us and sell us?” asked someone.

Shongololo’s shoes Prince Sugar and Awande, the baker Written by Ayanda Hlatshwayo  Illustrated by Chantelle and Burgen Thorne Prince Sugar started to feel a little afraid and his stomach felt a little sick, but he ate and ate until he had finished the leftover treats plus the one that Awande had brought that day.
There was once a prince named Sugar.
Prince Sugar was named after his love of sweet treats like cakes, biscuits, tarts, doughnuts and puddings.
Prince Sugar was so spoilt that he wouldn’t share any of his sweet treats with the “I no longer enjoy the treats,” said Prince Sugar the next morning when Awande arrived with the treat of the day.
Prince Sugar was so spoilt that he wouldn’t share any of his sweet treats with the “I no longer enjoy the treats,” said Prince Sugar the next morning when Awande arrived with the treat of the day.
“Nobody eats my cakes!
Understand, Mary?
That is the law!” said Prince Sugar to the royal baker.
“The cakes, biscuits and tarts all belong to me and “A promise is a promise, your Highness,” said Awande.
She started handing out slices of cake and biscuits to all the children.
When Prince Sugar heard about this, he became very angry and sent his guards to arrest the baker and bring her to him.
“How dare you enter my village and start giving out treats to the children.
It is against the law!” shouted Prince Sugar angrily.
Please allow me to fix my mistake by baking for you alone,” replied the baker, whose name was Awande.
“I will bake you a new treat every day.
These treats I bake are very special.
You have to eat the whole treat within a day.” “Of course, I’ll be able to finish a treat every day!” said the Prince greedily.
“Very well,” replied Awande with a smile.
So, every morning, Prince Sugar received a freshly baked treat, which he gobbled up.
As the days passed, the treats seemed to be tastier and bigger.
Prince Sugar was very happy, and he finished all these delicious cakes, biscuits and tarts without sharing even a tiny piece with the village children.
The prince looked sad.
“What can I do to stop you from baking treats for me every day?” asked Prince Sugar.
“You are called Prince Sugar because you love sweet things.
Yet, because of your laws, other children don’t know sweetness,” replied Awande.
“So, you must eat and eat the treats, until the children’s mouths are sweet.” With that, the baker turned around and walked out of the palace, leaving a big, tasty cake for Prince Sugar to eat.
Prince Sugar thought and thought about what Awande had said but he did not understand.
How could the children’s mouths be sweet if he was the only one eating Awande’s treats?
So, the prince went for a walk in the garden where it was quiet.
He had to think of a way to stop Awande from bringing sweet treats to him every day.
As he was walking along, a soccer ball flew over the high garden wall and landed in in the bushes.
Next a scruffy little boy appeared over the wall to fetch the ball.
When he saw Prince Sugar, he nearly fell over with fright.
I just came to get the ball back,” said the terrified boy.
Prince Sugar was so busy thinking of a plan to stop getting sweet treats that he forgot to be angry.
“Before you fetch your ball,” he said, “please tell me what would make your mouth sweet.” But as the treats grew bigger and bigger, Prince Sugar found that he could no longer finish them.
He had to store them in a secret part of the palace so that Awande wouldn’t know that he wasn’t finishing a treat every day.
“Things made with sugar, your Highness,” said the little boy shyly.
“Cakes and doughnuts and biscuits – all the things we are not allowed to eat.” The little boy looked so sad when he said this that Prince Sugar suddenly felt ashamed.
For the first time, he saw how selfish he had been.
He had so many treats that he no longer enjoyed them, but the village children had not tasted anything sweet for a very, very long time.
After a few weeks, Prince Sugar had had to store so many treats that no more would fit into the secret place.
So, he called his servants and Mary, the royal baker, and ordered them to throw away some of the treats.
The prince hurried back into the palace and sent for Awande.
“Make sure that Awande doesn’t see you doing this,” he commanded.
“Before you fetch your ball,” he said, “please tell me what would make your mouth sweet.” But as the treats grew bigger and bigger, Prince Sugar found that he could no longer finish them.
Next a scruffy little boy appeared over the wall to fetch the ball.
So, he called his servants and Mary, the royal baker, and ordered them to throw away some of the treats.
He had to think of a way to stop Awande from bringing sweet treats to him every day.
So, the next morning Mary and the servants carried the leftover treats deep into the forest behind the palace.
But a mysterious thing happened: that night, while everyone slept, all the treats that had been thrown in the forest reappeared in the palace!
So, the next morning Mary and the servants carried the leftover treats deep into the forest behind the palace.
“Awande,” he said, “I’ve been selfish and silly.
“With pleasure, your Highness!” she said, and she baked the fanciest and most delicious cakes, biscuits and tarts that the village people had even seen or tasted.
And they ate and ate until they were satisfied.
“Did you think I would not know if you threw my treats away?
Did you not agree to eat the whole treat that I sent by the end of the same day?
I warned you in the beginning that my treats were special and that you would have to finish each one,” said Awande angrily.
The following morning, Awande, the baker, had disappeared without a trace.
Prince Sugar continued to hold parties for the people of the village – but now he and Mary did the baking themselves.
After a few weeks, Prince Sugar had had to store so many treats that no more would fit into the secret place.

Whatever books you choose to explore with your children, enjoy the journey of discovery together!
Explore the world through books Day, 9 August Have you noticed how naturally curious children are?
Given the chance, they will ask question after question!
Use books to help them discover answers to their questions and to explore different topics together – you’ll find yourself asking questions too and you’ll learn things together.
Different kinds of books explore topics in different ways.
Here are a few examples.
 Realistic stories focus on real-life problems that the characters have to bullied or how to escape a fire.
 Biographies tell the stories of real people, like pop stars or famous scientists.
These books are written by authors who have spent time finding out about someone else’s life.
 Information books contain information and facts, for example, about the beliefs, rituals and practices of different religious groups, or how stars and planets are formed.
When you read storybooks, you usually start at the beginning and read through to the end so that you get the whole story!
Information books work differently.
Here are some ideas on how to share them with children.
On the cover.
Read the title and draw children’s attention to the pictures on the cover.
Can they use these to predict what the book is about?
Find the author’s name together – this helps to remind children that all books are written by real people!
What’s inside?
Look at the contents page at the beginning of the book to help you choose sections that grab your children’s interest.
Start, stop and skip.
Start by reading the part of the book that most interests your children.
If you’ve found the information they were looking for, or if they ask new questions, or if something else in the book interests them more, stop reading and skip to another part.
Different types of information.
Spend time looking at and discussing pictures, photographs, maps and diagrams together – they offer as much food for thought as the words on the page.
When you read storybooks, you usually start at the beginning and read through to the end so that you get the whole story!

Your story We asked Nal’ibali team members how books and stories had made a difference in their lives.
My grandfather was not an educated man, but he was blessed with the ability to tell great stories.
He would tell stories about how he grew up and the places he had been to.
And sometimes he told the most fantastical, original stories.
This, more than anything else, is the link to my love of books and who I am.
My love led to me receiving the prestigious University of Johannesburg Mardene Marais Literary Award for my contribution to literature.
Mardene Marais Literary Award e le go supa tlotlo ya seabe sa The tales and fables my grandfather shared at bedtime were meant to get me to engage with stories, to bond with my family and to fall asleep talking.
After all, who wants to sleep when there is one more chapter to read or one more book to pick up from the To-be-read pile?
Listening to my grandfather’s stories every evening gave me an inspiring and educational childhood with many happy memories as I now sit and read books like The Education of Little Tree with my mom.
There is one night that I will always cherish.
My grandmother told me to turn off the paraffin lamp and go to sleep.
But I continued to read.
I held the book up where the moon shone until my hands and wrists grew tired.
That was the turning point in my love of reading.
When I joined Nal’ibali, I took part in events like the Puku Story Festival and wrote my first was translated and published in the Nal’ibali supplement so that children all over South Africa could read it.
I have trained hundreds of teachers and ECD practitioners to rekindle their love of books and teaching and was listed by Avance Media as one of the 100 most influential young people in South Africa.
This year, I released two new books, Iingcinga zendoda (a collection of poems) and Mhla latsh’ iBhayi (a collection of short stories).
My dream is to see more inspirational books about ordinary people’s stories written in their mother tongues.

When you ask children to write book reviews, it is a great way to get them to connect with what they read, to think critically about it and to express their opinions.
Here are some ideas of how to use book reviews in your classroom and at your reading club.
 Encourage children to write down their opinion of a book they have read.
 Good book reviews help people decide whether they want to read the book or not.
In their reviews, the children should therefore give the basic story outline, but not give away too much about the story!
 Reviews can be long or short and can also include drawings of parts of the book by the reviewer.
 You can use the children’s book reviews to start conversations about books.
 Remind the children always to write the title of the book, the author’s name and their own name on their review.
They should also include the illustrator’s name, if there are pictures in the book.
G Sometimes children need a little help with what to put in a book review.
In this collection, the nine stories for children aged 6–12, focus on three money-related values: honesty, diligence, and the careful use of money and resources, or thrift.
Try giving them some of these sentences The main characters are … My favourite part of this book was … My favourite character was … I think you would enjoy this book if you like stories that … My rating for this book is: Take out pages 5 to 12 of this supplement.

The two laughed because everyone knew how loud and scratchy Jackal’s voice was.

Young Lion was there, pushing his way to the front of the crowd.
Tinny Tim carried on looking for the owner of the button.

“Thank you, little robot.

It was busy on the side of the road.
I’m sure that’s where this button comes from.” “That was close,” said Tinny Tim.
He waited for the cars to pass before he carried on.
He just turned red.
“I think this is yours,” said Tinny Tim as he gave her the button.
“Hey there, is this your button?” The green man said nothing.
Then Tinny Tim saw someone coming.
Little Brown Monkey got the gift of singing.

“Thank you, little robot.
“I wonder where this comes from,” he said.
He wanted to find out.
Then Tinny Tim saw someone coming.
Maybe this was who he was looking for.
“Hello, who are you?” he asked.
He had stolen the gift.
“It’s scary out here,” he said.
He wanted to find out.
“I’m Ruby Rags,” said the someone.
“I think this is yours,” said Tinny Tim as he gave her the button.
Tinny Tim nearly got squashed!
Springbok, just like Young Lion, and Antbear, wished the monkey’s gift was hers.
Then he crept in, took the small green bottle from the top of the table, and tiptoed out the room.
He sneaked into the house and returned the bottle of singing gift to the table where it And so, after a long time thinking … Young Lion decided to return the gift.
Then he crept out and headed home.

As he ran, his heart felt light and his feet felt free – freer than he had felt all day!
Then he crept out and headed home.
“Me, Young Lion, the future king.
“I’m Ruby Rags,” said the someone.
Springbok, just like Young Lion, and Antbear, wished the monkey’s gift was hers.
Later that day, Young Lion bumped into Springbok on the road and shouted, “Howzit, Sister Springbok?” They hurried through their greetings so that they could get to the topic of the gift.

On his way, Young Lion met Antbear.
They greeted each other.
They talked about what they had eaten for breakfast, about the weather, about New Year’s resolutions and about the gifts-gathering at the Young Lion started for home, and on his way he muttered to himself, “That singing gift should be mine, mine, mine and mine.
Young Lion sat outside and waited until the other monkeys had gone home.
“Wait your turn until next year when the King brings gifts; maybe you will get it next year.
Jackal was right − everybody knew that Young Lion was also a bad singer.
It would be easy for them to spot him as the one who had stolen Little Brown Monkey’s gift.

I deserve it.
I’m going to steal it away from Little Brown Monkey.” Young Lion began to run.
He ran as though something was chasing him.
As he ran, he remembered what Mother Antbear had said about treating others in the way you want them to treat you.
The thought made him stop running, and he stood still and thought.
It would be easy for them to spot him as the one who had stolen Little Brown Monkey’s gift.
He understood that.
He thought about how he would feel if he was Little Brown Monkey and and angry,” he thought.
I don’t want my things to be stolen, so I should not steal from others.” Antbear told Young Lion that she also wished the singing gift was hers.
“So what is stopping you from taking it, Ma Antbear?” asked Young Lion.
Antbear said, “I want to treat others in the way I want them to treat me.
I don’t want my things to be stolen, so I should not steal from others.” Antbear told Young Lion that she also wished the singing gift was hers.

You’re too small Written by Dorothy Dyer  Illustrated by Magriet Brink and Leo Daly “Can I help you wrap the necklace?” asked Thapelo.
“No, sorry, Thapelo, you’re too small,” his father said.
“No, sorry, Thapelo, you’re too small,” his father said.
You’re too small Written by Dorothy Dyer  Illustrated by Magriet Brink and Leo Daly “Can I help you wrap the necklace?” asked Thapelo.
Mama Tau was coming home!
“No, sorry, Thapelo, you’re too small,” his father said.
But Bless just sat there.
He looked at their dog, Bless, sitting next to Ntate.
“Come, Bless,” he called.
But Bless just sat there.
On the day of Mama Tau’s arrival, the family spent the morning preparing.
The sun was shining outside.
Refilwe was in her room getting music to play for when Mama walked through the front door.
He wanted to show his mother how much better his soccer was since the last time she had seen him.
“Catch this one, Bless,” he shouted to the dog.
But Bless just looked at the ball and went inside.
Thapelo went outside and sat on the front step.
“I wish I could grow as tall as a giant,” he thought.
“Then they’d all be scared of me and nobody would say, ‘You’re too small.’” Thapelo followed the dog and went to find his older sister, Refilwe.
“Bless!
“Then they’d all be scared of me and nobody would say, ‘You’re too small.’” Thapelo followed the dog and went to find his older sister, Refilwe.
Refilwe was a DJ.
She was so cool that she wore her sunglasses even inside the house.
Refilwe was in her room getting music to play for when Mama walked through the front door.
“I’m not going to play any of that rap she complains about,” Refilwe said.
“Today we will only hear jazz.
Just how Mama likes it.” She took off her sunglasses and winked at Thapelo.
“Maybe you can dance with Mama.” Just then he heard a loud shout from inside the house.
And after Bless ran Ntate.
Then Saul.
Then Refilwe.
Thapelo joined them and ran after Bless too.
“That dog has stolen Mama’s present!” Ntate shouted as he passed Thapelo.
Thapelo joined them and ran after Bless too.
Bless jumped through a hole in the fence, into the yard next door.
“Come back, Bless!” they called.
Then Refilwe put on her headphones and started nodding her head to the music.
“Can I help you?” asked Thapelo.
“What did you say?” “Oh no, he’s left it next door!” Ntate groaned.
“And the Sitholes are away till tomorrow!
So, it’s stuck on the other side of the fence till they come back!” “Can I help you?” Thapelo shouted.
“Can I help you?” asked Thapelo.
“No,” they all said together.
“You’re too ...” They stopped.
They looked at Thapelo.
“No need to shout,” Refilwe said.
“I can hear you perfectly.” Then she shook her head.
“This is all on the computer, Thapelo.
So, you can’t help.
“Are you small enough?” asked Saul.
“Are you small enough?” asked Saul.
Then Refilwe put on her headphones and started nodding her head to the music.
Thapelo went to find his brother, Saul.
He was in the kitchen, baking one of his very special cakes.
Whenever there was a special occasion, Saul made a cake.
For Thapelo’s last birthday, he had made a chocolate cake with Smarties on top.
Saul was wearing a striped apron and was stirring the cake mixture in a big bowl.
“This is a lemon cake,” he told Thapelo.
“Can I help you?” he asked.
“No,” he said.
You’re too small.” He went to find his other sister, Mampotoko, who was putting up decorations in the lounge.
There were paper chains and balloons.
“Can I help you?” he asked.
He just fitted through.
There, on the grass in the Sithole’s yard, was the wrapped present, with just a little bit of the wrapping paper torn.
“Three cheers for Thapelo!” Saul said, and they all hugged him.
“You are a star!” “Here, see if you can blow these up,” she said, handing Thapelo some balloons.
He chose a red one and started blowing.
He tried and he tried but he couldn’t get enough air into it.
Later that afternoon there was a knock on the door.
It was Mama!
Thapelo rushed into her arms.
“How you’ve grown, my boy,” she said.
He was sitting at the table, wrapping up a bead necklace for Mama.

Treating books as treasures Books are expensive and so it is understandable that we want them to last.
How can we help our children learn to take good care of books so that they can be enjoyed over and over again?
We cannot expect children to treat books well if they do not love stories!
When you spend time reading and enjoying stories with children, they soon learn to treasure books.
Too many rules about using books are likely to destroy children’s love of stories.
Try to have a few simple rules that make sense to children.
For example: “Let’s keep water and things we drink away from books because if we spill on our books, they “Let’s make sure our hands are not sticky when we look at books because if some of the pages stick together, we won’t be able to read the whole story!” Help children learn to care for books by creating special places to store them.
TEACH BY EXAMPLE Children learn more by watching us than by being told what to do.
So, if you don’t treat books well, you can’t expect children to do so!
Show them how to treat books.
For example: as you read to them, turn the pages carefully.
when you have finished reading a story, return the book to its place on the bookshelf.
Expect what is reasonable.
Children need to spend time looking at or reading books on their own.
Encourage age-appropriate book behaviour in your children.
For example: it is “normal” for babies to chew the corners of books – because they put everything into their mouths – but we wouldn’t expect three-year olds to do this.
seven year-olds can be expected to turn the pages of a book gently, but many three-year-olds cannot yet manage this.
As with most things in life, learning to take care of books involves time, practice and encouragement.
Children will learn this much faster if they experience the pleasure that reading and books offer.

Provide materials.
You can’t learn to read if you don’t have anything to read, and you can’t learn to write if you don’t have anything to write with or on!

“We’re going to Gogo Moeng’s house.
It is her birthday,” explained Sipho.
“I’ve got a bunch of flowers for Gogo Moeng.
Can I come too?” “Of course,” said Momma and off they marched.
The bunch of flowers made Valecia sneeze, “Achoo!
A-A-Achoooo!” The chubby chicken went chuk-chuk-chook, chuk-chuk-chook, the packet of crispy potato chips went crinkle-crinkle, Baby Beka’s balloon went bobbity-bob and Momma’s slipslops went pliff-ploff, pliff-ploff down the dusty path until they saw Mr Sithole digging in his vegetable garden.
Momma Moeng sets out to surprise Gogo Moeng on her birthday.
She carries the jar of jam she made on her head, and ties Baby Beka and his blue balloon to her back.
Along the way, they meet many more well-wishers, and Momma Moeng ends up heading a noisy, colourful procession carrying piles of presents to Gogo.
When they finally get to Gogo’s house, there is a short pause, but then the party really gets going!

Then Baby Beka found his best blue balloon.
He wanted to give it to Gogo for her birthday.
Momma tied Baby Beka to her back with a soft blanket.
Then she put the jar of jam on her head and off she marched to Gogo Moeng’s house.
Baby Beka’s balloon went bobbity-bob and Momma’s slipslops went pliff-ploff, pliff-ploff down the dusty path until she met Sipho coming out of the Tip-Top shop.
“Where are you going, Momma Moeng?” asked Sipho.
“Baby Beka and I are going to Gogo Moeng’s house.
It’s her birthday today,” replied Momma.
“I’ve got a packet of crispy potato chips for Gogo Moeng.
Can I come too?” asked Sipho.
“Of course,” Momma smiled and off they marched.
“Where are you all going, Momma Moeng?” Mr Sithole asked.
“We’re going to Gogo Moeng’s house.
It’s her birthday,” she replied.
“I have a trolley full of vegetables for her,” said Mr Sithole.
“Please could you give it to her?” “Of course,” answered Momma.
But now Momma had a BIG problem − there was too much to carry!
She had to think of a plan.
First, she took Baby Beka off her back and then tied the chubby chicken onto her back with the soft blanket.
Baby Beka SCREAAAAMED!
So, Momma put the chubby chicken on top of the trolley and tied Baby Beka onto her back with the soft blanket.
Baby Beka was happy and the chubby chicken was very happy to peck at all the vegetables.
But Momma wasn’t happy with this so she put the chubby chicken on Valecia’s head.
The feathers tickled Valecia’s nose and made her sneeze even more, “AAAAA-CHOOOOO!” Valecia wasn’t happy.

They march into the setting sun.
Little Ant loved to read.
Little Ant was often teased.
“Ants don’t read.
Ants must feed.
Ants collect the food they need.” Lefelo le batho ba jang kwa go lone.
The ants go marching one by one, carrying a burger, carrying a bun.
Little Ant begins to shout about a place he read about, “A restaurant is what we need, a place where people go to feed.
It says so in the books I read.” Little Ant would read all day, he’d read and read the day away.
The other ants took what they found to store for winter underground.
His baby sister takes his hand, “Now I think I understand.
The way you love to read a book … When they returned, the queen is glad.
The stores are full.
They cheer like mad.

The queen wants food to fill the store, so all the ants must work some more.

Little Ant gets hugs from Mum and Dad.
When she opened it, everyone started singing a happybirthday song.
On the table were the vegetable pie and jam tarts that Momma had made, newly laid eggs from the chubby chicken, the special birthday cake and the crispy potato chips.
The table was decorated with flowers and Baby Beka’s beautiful blue balloon.
Gogo.
And she should know, because Gogo had already had at least eighty or ninety birthdays before this one!
So, Momma took the chubby chicken and put it on Sipho’s head and she gave him Valecia’s flowers to hold.
Now Valecia had two hands free to hold the cake.
And Momma had two hands free to push the trolley.
Everyone was happy and off they marched to Gogo Moeng’s house.
The wheels of the trolley went squeak-squeak-squeak.
Valecia had icing from the cake on her cheeks so her tongue went slurp-slurp-slurp.
Baby Beka mumbled, “Nummy, nummy, num-num.” The chubby chicken went chuk-chuk-chook, chuk-chuk-chook, the packet of crispy potato chips went crinkle-crinkle, Baby Beka’s balloon went bobbity-bob and Momma’s slipslops went pliff-ploff, pliff-ploff down the dusty path all the way to Gogo’s house.
“We must get a birthday cake for Gogo,” said Momma.
They went inside.
Ting-a-ling went the doorbell.
“Good morning, Mrs Makabelo.
Did you know today is Gogo Moeng’s birthday?” “Oh yes,” said Mrs Makabelo.
“I have baked a special cake for her, but I can’t leave the shop.
Could you take it to her?” “Of course,” offered Momma, but there was a problem − Momma needed two hands to carry the cake.
So, she made a plan.
She put the chubby chicken on top of the jar of jam that she was carrying on her head.
Now she had two hands to carry the special birthday cake.
Off marched Momma, Baby Beka and Sipho through the ting-a-ling door.
When Baby Beka smelt the cake he mumbled, “Nummy, nummy, The chubby chicken went chuk-chuk-chook, chuk-chuk-chook, the packet of crispy potato chips went crinkle-crinkle, Baby Beka’s balloon went bobbity-bob and Momma’s slipslops went pliff-ploff, pliff-ploff down the dusty path until they met Valecia.

Someone is calling me.
Now I can’t go to the shops to buy my birthday supper.” Gogo turned round and walked all the way up the steep hill.
Her slippers went shuffle-shuffle on the dusty path.
Finally she reached the back door.
Sipho’s packet of crispy potato chips went crinkle-crinkle, Baby Beka’s balloon went bobbity-bob and Momma’s slipslops went pliff-ploff, pliff-ploff down the dusty path until they came to Mr Shabalala, who was feeding his chickens.
“Where are you going?” he asked.
“We’re going to Gogo Moeng’s house.
It’s her birthday,” answered Momma.
“I’ve got a chubby chicken for Gogo Moeng.

Momma knocked on the front door.
Sipho whistled.
Valecia shouted.
But there was no reply.
Momma pushed the front door open and they all went inside.
But there was no one there.
They looked in the kitchen − nobody.
They looked in the bedroom − nobody.
They looked everywhere.
Where could Gogo be?
Momma said, “Let’s get cooking and maybe Gogo will turn up.” So that is what everyone did – everyone except Baby Beka.
He sat on the kitchen counter next to the window and watched until he saw Gogo walking way down the path at the very bottom of the ne ba re tshe-tshe-tshe-tshe mo tselaneng e e lerole go fitlhelela ba fitlha Mme ke seo batho botlhe ba neng ba se dira – batho botlhe kwa Get story active!

He dreamt of a big juicy patch of grass floating right by him and, in his dream, he took a big bite and swallowed.
“Don’t do that!
He is going to eat you too!” Monkey warned.
“You ate Little Bird!” The voice woke Hippo up with a fright.
It was one of the “Oh, be quiet!” Owl told them.
But softly he said to Hippo, “You had better not!

He looked very angry!
His pink face was turning red!
Whatever you do, do not close your mouth while I am in there!” “You ate Little Bird,” he shouted again, pointing his wing at Hippo.
Owl climbed inside Hippo’s huge and scary jaws!
Then he began to tickle “I would never!” Hippo defended himself.
“I eat grass, not little birds!

I wouldn’t eat him!” then suddenly... “I saw you!
He was cleaning your teeth, and you swallowed him up!” “Gha...gha...ghaaaaa!” Hippo coughed, and Owl and Little Bird came flying out of his mouth!
Both of them were dripping with hippo spit.
Little Bird hugged Hippo remembered his dream.
Now he was scared!
Had he swallowed his Owl and then rushed to hug Hippo too.
friend by mistake?
Then, as he climbed out of the river, he heard a familiar chirping sound.
It was Little Bird!
Hippo looked all around to see where Little Bird was.
At last, he realised that the sound was coming from inside his tummy.
He had swallowed his friend!
“See?
I told you!” said Flamingo.
“You ate Little Bird!” “I ...
I didn’t mean to ...” Hippo cried, “We need to rescue him.
We have to get him out of my tummy!” By now all the animals living along the river had come closer to find out what was going on.
They started coming up with plans.
“Let’s send some small fish down into your tummy.
They can lead the way for Little Bird to swim back out,” said Monkey.
But hearing this, all the small fish quickly swam away.
“We can use one of my teeth to cut your stomach open and save Little Bird,” suggested Lion.
Hippo didn’t think that sounded like a good idea!
“I am so sorry!” said Hippo.
“Don’t feel bad,” said Little Bird.
“I should have woken you up when you fell asleep.
I know you didn’t mean to.
It was just a mistake, and besides, I am perfectly alright.” Hippo and Little Bird turned to Owl who was busy washing his wings in the river.
“Thank you, Owl.
You saved the day!” they said.
“Pleasure!” said Owl, washing the last bit of spit out of his feathers.
“Now, if everyone could be quiet, I can go back to sleep.” Owl flew back to the hollow of a big tree that was his home.
All the other animals went back to their own business.
Flamingo’s face went back to its usual pink colour, but he was still shaking his head.
“Silly bird!
He eats you but you still stay friends,” he muttered.
Then he went back to his spot, stood on one leg and fell asleep.
“I really am sorry,” said Hippo to Little Bird again.
“I understand if you don’t “What are we going to do?
Little Bird can’t stay in my tummy forever!” said want to clean my teeth again.” Hippo.
But he just couldn’t think of any better ideas.
Perhaps he should let Lion cut open his tummy and take out Little Bird.
He was just about to agree “But then you will get toothache!” answered Little Bird.
“We’ll just make sure to it when wise old Owl came to the rescue.
that you don’t fall asleep while I’m doing it.
Now let’s go and find you some juicy grass to eat.
I’m sure you must be hungry.” “Calm down, everyone,” said Owl.
Everyone listened.
“Get me a big feather,” And off they went.

What about the girls?
What we tell our children about girls and women is an important part of building a more equal society.
And we tell them about girls and women in lots of different ways.
One of these is through the stories we share with them.
STORIES HAVE THE POWER TO SHAPE THE WAY WE SEE OURSELVES AND THE WORLD.
The stories children hear and read help them to work out who they are, what their place in the world is and how they relate to others.
If we want to build a more equal society, the stories that we share with children should not teach them to feel inferior nor superior because of their gender.
What is left out in the stories we read, is as important as what is in them!
For example, if the only characters in the stories we read are boys, then our children learn that girls and If boys are always the heroes in the stories, our children learn that only men can be leaders.
So, we need to think carefully about the books we choose to read to our children.
HERE ARE A FEW QUESTIONS TO HELP Se se tlogetsweng mo mainaneng a re a Are women (especially black women) always shown as needing help, while men are always in leadership and action roles?
Are the achievements of girls and women based on their own initiative and intelligence?
Or do they achieve because of the way they look or because a boy or man helps them?
Do the girls or women in the story have to change to be accepted?
Do the main female characters make decisions about how they live their lives?
If they don’t, is this perhaps because the story is trying to show that treating woman as inferior, is wrong?
The more children read stories with strong female role models in them, the more girls are encouraged to become strong women, and boys learn not to be threatened by strong women.

One morning, Little Hat’s mother sends her to her grandmother’s house with a pot of tomato bredie.
She warns Little Hat not to talk to anyone along the way, but Little Hat stops to talk to a very hungry, dishonest leopard … Little Hat Earlier that morning Little Hat’s grandmother had left to sell a sack of herbs at the market.
She had gone off in such a hurry that she had left her bed unmade and her shawl on the pillow.
“Good!” said the leopard to himself.
“I know just what to do.” He shut the door and closed the curtains.
Then he wrapped the shawl around his head and lay down under the blanket on the bed.
Meanwhile Little Hat was making her way to her grandmother’s house.
Along the way, she stopped to watch some birds feeding and a dung beetle rolling along a ball of dung.
When she eventually arrived at her grandmother’s house, she knocked on the door.
“Who’s there?” asked the leopard, making his voice sound as soft as possible.
“It’s me, Granny, Little Hat.
I have a pot of tomato bredie for you for tomorrow.” “Open the door, child, and come in,” said the leopard.
“You sound like you have a cold, Granny,” said Little Hat.
“A little one, my dear,” said the leopard pretending to cough.
“Now shut the door and put that pot on the table.
Then you can take off your hat and your shoes and socks and lie here next to me so that you can have a little rest.” Little Hat took off her shoes and socks, but she kept her hat on and she lay down next to the leopard.
“That’s because of the pattern on my shawl,” said the leopard.
“How hairy your arms are!” commented Little Hat.
“They’re just right for hugging you,” explained the leopard.
“Gosh, what a big tongue you have, Granny!” said Little Hat.
“It is good for answering you,” said the leopard, who was getting tired of this conversation.
“Oh!
What a mouthful of big white teeth you have,” noticed Little Hat.
There was once a little girl, so pretty and so sweet that everyone loved her.
Her real name was Nandi, but everyone called her Little Hat because of the gold and fire-coloured hat, which she always wore – except when she was asleep!
The hat was given to her by her grandmother, who was so old she did not know her own age.
Her grandmother said that the hat was made of a ray of sunshine and a moonbeam, and it would bring Nandi good luck.
And believe it or not, this was One Saturday morning Nandi’s mother said, “Little Hat, you are old enough to find your way by yourself.
Take this pot of tomato bredie to your grandmother for her meal tomorrow, ask her how she is and then come back at once.
Don’t stop on the way and don’t talk to people that you do not know.
Do you understand?” “Oh, yes, yes,” said Little Hat happily.
She was excited as she went off with the pot inside a basket.
She felt proud to be going by herself.

States of America.
Koo SIndiwe a ithutela Her hard work paid off!
She won a scholarship to study at a university in New York.
She and her three small children packed their bags and flew across the sea to the United States of America.
There Sindiwe studied to become a social worker.
She wanted to help families make their lives better.
One day a very clever baby was born in Gungululu in the Eastern Cape.
Her name was Sindiwe Magona.
She was the oldest of eight children.
When she had finished studying, she worked in the USA for twenty years.
She left the school to work as a cleaner.
She worked in four different houses.
Sometimes the people there treated her badly and Sindiwe became very unhappy.
While she was there, Sindiwe told the world about South Africa and how hard it was for most people living here.
People loved to listen to her stories and wanted to learn more and more about South Africans.
Everyone joined together to help to change things in South Africa.
Sindiwe’s love for books and stories have helped her write piles and piles of books.
And children and grown-ups love to read her stories.
Many people call her “Nomabali” because she’s always writing, telling and reading stories.
At night, her grandmother told magical stories about ogres and giants, animals of the forests, great beasts, and little creatures of the veld.
It was Sindiwe’s favourite time.
Sindiwe trained to be a teacher.
She was very excited to teach at her first school.
But there weren’t any desks for the children or books for them to write in.
This made Sindiwe feel scared.
How could she be a good teacher when the children had nowhere to sit or write?
Sindiwe loved school and she dreamed of being a teacher.
When Sindiwe became a teenager, her family organised a feast to celebrate.
She was given special things to wear and a wise old man sang a praise song to her: Blessings, long life!
But Sindiwe missed the country where she was born.
She wanted to tell her stories to the people at home.
So she packed her luggage, got on a plane and flew back over the sea to Cape Town.
May your ancestors guard you!
tshwanetse go solofetsa gore ga a kitla a tlhola a bua le batho ba When she got back to her house, she helped Little Hat put on her shoes and socks.
“It’s a good thing that you had your hat to protect you,” said Little Hat’s grandmother.
“Without it, where would you be now?” A little later she took Little Hat by the hand and together they walked back to her village.
Once they got home they told Little Hat’s mother what had happened.
Little Hat was scolded until the sun went down.
Over and over, she had to promise that she would never talk to strangers again, until, at last, her mother forgave her.
To this day, Nandi (or Little Hat) has kept her promise.
Sometimes you can see her in the village shopping for her mother.
She only talks to the people she knows.
And you will recognise her by the gold and fire-coloured hat that she always wears – the one that looks as if it is made of a ray of sunshine and a moonbeam.
“O, ee, ee,” Hutshenyana a bua a itumetse.
O ne a itumetse fa “Ha!
That’s for crunching up little children!” shouted the leopard opening his jaws wide to bite Little Hat.
But as Little Hat put her head down and shouted for her mother, the leopard’s jaws caught the golden hat that she always wore.
The leopard screamed in pain.
He shook his head from side to side.
His mouth was burning as if he had swallowed red hot coals.
The hat had burnt his tongue and his throat.
He jumped off the bed and tried to make his way to the front door.
“I’m going to my grandmother to take her some tomato bredie for her Sunday lunch tomorrow,” answered Little Hat.
“Ah, that is such a nice idea.
And where does your grandmother live?” the leopard asked.
“She lives over there in the first house in the village, right next to the big kokerboom.
Do you know it?” asked Little Hat.
“Yes!
I know now,” said the leopard.
“Well, that’s just where I am going.
I will probably get there before you because my legs are much faster than your little legs.
I’ll tell your grandmother that you’re on your way to her.” The leopard darted across the dry veld and in no time at all he arrived at Little Hat’s grandmother’s house.
He knocked on the door.
There was no answer.
He knocked again – louder this time – but there was no one at home.
So he put his paw on the door handle, pressed it down and opened the door.
Little Hat’s grandmother lived in the next village and Little Hat had to walk through the veld to get there.
When she had gone a little way, Little Hat thought she heard something moving nearby.
“Is someone there?” she asked.
“Oh, hello,” said the leopard, “so nice to see you, Little Hat.” He had watched her leave her village alone and had followed her, hiding behind the rocks as he went.
He came up to her like a friendly dog and Little Hat stopped to talk to him, which was the last thing she should “How are you, Little Hat?” the leopard asked.
“How do you know me?” asked Little Hat.
“What’s your name?” “My name is Friend Leopard.
And where are you going pretty one, with your golden hat and pot of food?” asked the leopard.
Just at that moment Little Hat’s grandmother arrived home with her empty herb sack over her shoulder.
She saw the leopard opening the door and quickly opened the sack and stretched it across the doorway.
“Oh no, you don’t!” she said, catching the leopard in the sack.
Then the brave old lady ran to the dam and threw the sack into it.
The leopard fell head first into the water.

Sefako and the singing Sefako falls in love with a crocodile.

Why or why not?

Draw your favourite animal.
Write a song or poem about your animal.
Sefako and the singing crocodile Written by Rudo Mungoshi  Illustrated by Samantha van Riet “Don’t be afraid,” said the crocodile gently.
“I have watched you sleeping under that tree for so many days, but I have not hurt you.
Why would I eat you now?” Then the crocodile started to sing a soothing song that instantly warmed Sefako’s heart.
Many years ago, in a faraway village, there lived a beautiful girl called Sefako.
Sefako stole the hearts of many men in the village.
They would write poems and songs praising her beauty.
But Sefako was not interested in marrying any of them, and this made her father angry because he thought it was time for his daughter to settle down.
No longer afraid, the beautiful girl sat up and listened to the voice that she was growing to love.
What Sefako did not know was that she had an unusual secret admirer!
And this secret admirer was the crocodile who lived at the river where she fetched water.
Every day, a few hours before sunset, Sefako would walk down to the river with her clay pot to fetch water for the evening meal.
After that, Sefako would rush down to the river to meet the singing crocodile every evening, and after a while, she decided that she wanted to marry him.
Eventually, she found the courage to tell her father.
Sefako had a habit of taking a short nap under her favourite tree after drawing water from the river.
The crocodile often hid in the water watching her sleep.
He longed to speak to her but had no idea as to how he could get her attention without scaring her.
Sefako’s father was not pleased at all!
“Does this crocodile of yours have any cattle to pay your dowry?” he asked angrily.
“Will he be able to give you children and build a home for you?” Even though Sefako’s father did not approve of her marrying the crocodile, her feelings did not change.
When her father realised that his daughter was not going to change her mind, he locked her up in one of the village huts.
Every day at midday, he would bring her food and check on her.
One day, the crocodile found the courage to come closer to Sefako after she had fallen sleep.
The lovestruck crocodile was so happy to be near Sefako that he started singing about his love for her.
But one day Sefako’s father forgot to lock the hut’s door.
Sefako waited a while to make sure it was safe before she opened the door and quickly ran down to the river.
As soon as she got there, Sefako called out, “Crocodile, Crocodile, it’s me, Sefako!” The crocodile, who had been looking for her desperately for many days, rose from under the water to greet her.
The next day, Sefako’s father discovered that she was missing, and he was furious!
Filled with anger, he grabbed a thick stick and followed his daughter’s footprints to the river.
He was determined to stop his daughter from marrying the crocodile.
When he reached the banks of the river, he saw Sefako swimming in the river with the crocodile beside her.
“Sefako, Sefako,” he called.
“Come back here immediately!
You may not marry that crocodile.” Sefako heard the beautiful song and turned in her sleep, thinking that she had to be dreaming.
The crocodile did not want Sefako to wake up and see him, so he slid back into the river quickly.
This happened again the next day … and the next … and the next.
Sefako would hear the crocodile singing to her in her sleep but when she woke up, there was no one around.
She only heard the gentle rustling of the leaves and the cattle bellowing far away.
The singing moved her heart, and Sefako wanted to see the singer more and more.
So Sefako began to search for the mysterious voice among the reeds, trees and grass but she found no one.
One day, Sefako decided she would not search for the mysterious singer any longer.
Instead, she planned to catch the owner of the beautiful voice!
Sefako collected water from the river as usual and went to lie down under her favourite tree pretending to sleep.
As usual, the lovesick crocodile crawled out of the river to sing to her.
Sefako turned her head and waved to her father before swimming away with the crocodile.
The troubled father watched helplessly as his daughter and the crocodile disappeared under the water.
When Sefako heard the beautiful voice, she opened her eyes quickly and found herself gazing into the eyes of … A CROCODILE!
Some time later, Sefako returned to visit her village.
Her father’s heart was filled with joy to see her.
He had missed her so much, and in that moment, he knew what he had to do.
Sefako was very scared!
Quickly, she leapt to her feet, knocking over her clay pot and spilling all the water on the ground.
Then she started to run up the bank but, unfortunately, tripped over a rock and fell, hitting the ground with a heavy thud.
The lovesick crocodile, who had followed her, stood nearby watching her.
As he crawled closer, Sefako froze with fear.
“Welcome, welcome, both of you,” he said, running to greet Sefako and the crocodile.
And then he turned to the crocodile and said, “Welcome to our family.” šakgala thata!

Read in your language!
We all have at least one language that we understand and communicate best in, although some of us may have more!
It’s the language we think and feel in, the one in which it is easiest for us to express ourselves and communicate with others.
When you read to children regularly in their home language/s, you give them a strong language foundation that makes ALL learning easier.
When you read to children regularly in their home language/s, you give them a strong language foundation that makes ALL learning easier.
Here are 4 important reasons why you should try to read good books in your home language to your children.
When you read to children regularly in their home language/s, you give them a strong language foundation that makes ALL learning easier.
If you don’t understand what you are reading, then you are not really reading – no matter how well you can say the words on the page!
Because understanding is at the heart of reading, children need to listen to stories being read in their home language.
They can then concentrate completely on the flow of the story instead of struggling to understand a language they don’t know well yet.
Good stories are full of creative language that stimulates our imaginations and gets us thinking about how to solve problems.
They inspire children to read in their home language and then, later on, to learn to read stories in other languages too.

“I’d like to see him try!” “Who are you?” asked Flossie in a shaky voice.

Night is already here, and my home is still far away.” She began to cry little field mouse tears.

It’s holiday time!
The year is almost over and soon it will be that time of year when most of us are able to spend more time than usual with family and friends.
It’s time for that long-awaited end-of-year break.
That time of year when we can all slow down a bit, relax and spend time doing more of the things we enjoy.
SPEND TIME WITH A GOOD BOOK OR TWO When your children see you relaxing with a book: They learn that reading is something you do for pleasure.
They learn that reading is something that can be done for leisure.
And so, without even trying to, you are being a powerful reading role model for your children and helping them to become lifelong readers.
WE HAVE STORIES TO TELL!
Often there are also a lot of celebrations around this time of the year.
As adults, there are times when we think back to how we experienced these celebrations as children.
Have you ever thought about sharing these stories about your childhood with Stories help them to develop their imagination and creativity.
They help them to develop their language and thinking.
And sharing the stories of your childhood helps to connect the generations of your family.
These stories give children a sense of where they come from and who they are.
We will be taking a break until the week of 28 January 2022.
Join us then for more Nal’ibali reading magic!
The holidays also mean that we have more time to spend with our children – and this is a real reward for them.
We have time to spend reading their favourite stories to them and finding new ones to enjoy too.
We also have time to do other fun reading and writing activities that connect with their interests.
Whatever you do and wherever you will be this holiday season, relax and have a fabulous, story-filled holiday!

Every year, on 18 December, International Migrants Day is celebrated all over the world.
It is a time to raise awareness of the challenges and difficulties that migrants have to deal with.
At the end of the year, many of us look forward to spending more time with our families.
Some leave their homes to travel to rural areas, other cities or provinces to visit them.
Do you sometimes wonder where other people are travelling to or where they come from?
Have you ever had to travel to another country to visit your family?
People who come to live in a country they were not born in are called migrants.
Some migrants choose to leave their countries to look for jobs, to go to school or to join family members who live in another country.
Refugees are migrants who are forced to leave their countries because of war or violence.
Refugees try to find safety in another country.
Why not take some time to think about the migrants and refugees who are far from their friends and family and cannot travel home to see them?

Migrants have knowledge, resources and skills that can help to build communities, but often they have to deal with prejudice and unfairness.
Migrant children must also cope with a new school system, fitting in with other children and sometimes learning in a new language.
A stateless person is someone who is not recognized as a citizen of any country in the world.
Children who are stateless often cannot go to school, cannot go to the doctor or cannot get a social grant.
Many struggle their whole life to find work or a home.
Stateless children face serious problems, such as child labour, child trafficking, child marriage and other types of abuse.
The Girl Who Lost Her Country The Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion wrote a book called The Girl Who Lost Her Country.

The idea is to enjoy yourselves, so use the language/s you and your children feel most comfortable with.
Read and listen.
Fill your holiday with new stories and old favourites by finding stories to read and listen to on Nal’ibali’s website (www.nalibali.org) and wherever you go!

Recycle unused notebooks or staple some sheets of paper together to create holiday scrapbooks for your children.
Encourage them to write about the things they do during the school holidays in their scrapbooks and to draw pictures in them too.
They could also include things like tickets or pamphlets from places they have been to or even the wrapper of a treat they enjoyed.
Play games.
Many games involve reading.
Have regular game evenings with friends and family.
Have a pretend party.
Let your children have fun imagining who they would invite to a party to celebrate the start of a new year.
Then suggest they write party invitations and a menu for their pretend party.
Follow a recipe.
With your children, follow a recipe for something you have not made before.
Remember to read the recipe aloud as you go – or ask your children to do this.
Let them help you gather the ingredients, mix and stir.
Play a guessing game.
Give your children a clue to something near you and see if they can guess what it is.
For example, “It is white and has a door.
It keeps things cold.” (Answer: the fridge.)
Take turns giving the clues and guessing.

“Shumba!” I shouted again.
Tears began to form in my eyes.
I knew Shumba was doomed!
The witch would kill him and cut him up into little pieces for her potions.
I stood at the gate trying to think what I could do.
“Oh no!
Shumba went into the witch’s house!” Gabriel cried.
“He’s dead for sure.” I shouted, but it was too late.

Peloyame knew everything there was to know about Mma Raphane, the witch.
“She poked her head out of the door when I threw the stone, did you see?” Kitso said excitedly.
“My cousin said she ate his cat.” “Yeah, she’s scary,” I said, though I hadn’t really seen her.
But I didn’t need to.
Everyone knew what Mma Raphane looked like.
She had wild grey hair and was tall and bony-thin, with elbows that could cut straight through a person.
If you looked into her eyes, you would be turned into a zombie.

We all knew that.

Just then, I saw someone push the door open and my heart pounded!
Then Shumba came running out.
I grabbed him and hugged him.
He was safe!
When I looked up, an old woman stood on the small stoep in front of the house.
She was bent over and leaning hard on a cane.
Her grey hair was tucked away tidily.
I looked into her eyes and I was surprised nothing changed inside of me.
Mma Raphane smiled at me.
“That dog seems a handful “Sorry he troubled you,” I said.
She smiled sadly, but said nothing more.
She turned and made her way back into the Gabriel and I headed home down the hill.
We’d forgotten about hunting.
“She doesn’t look anything like a witch,” “Yes, I know.
I don’t think she’s a witch.
I think Peloyame and the others made it up,” I said.
Now I felt really bad about the way the children in the village had been treating Mma Raphane for so long.
I felt bad that I’d been part of it too.

There was a sound like distant thunder.
It got louder and louder.
They rushed around the farm collecting all the things they needed.
“No!
Find a bigger packet.
That one’s too small.” “I think we might need that packet too.” “And bring those branches!” “Where are those guinea fowl feathers?” “And you are making a mess,” complained the “Yes.
We will!” Suddenly all the animals had ideas about how to help Little Pig fly.
“You’ll hurt yourself,” warned the hen.
Little Pig sniffed and wiped away his tears.
“Really?” he asked.
“Will you help me?” “No,” said the cow.
“That sounds like a very bad plan, and I don’t want anything to do with it.” “So if you really, really want to fly, we will help you,” said the hen.
“I’m trying …” panted Little Pig, “… to climb up onto this roof.
I’ve made some wings, you see, and I’m hoping to fly.
Could you help and pass me those feathers?” “And boring,” said the old goat.
“Yes,” said the cow.
“You must always have hope, Little Pig.
Life without hope is very … empty.
And sad.” “What are you doing?” asked the cow.
“Well,” said Little Pig, “I have things to do.” And off he trotted.
“Thank goodness he’s gone,” muttered the old goat.
“It’s just too early for his nonsense.” Eventually the animals got up and did what they always do.
Stand around.
Chew.
Scratch.
Moan.
Scratch a bit more.
Moan.
Only Little Pig was busy.
All morning he ran around the farm, humming a little hum.
The other animals watched as he rushed backwards and forwards with things in his mouth.

She turned to Gabriel and me.
There were tears in her eyes.
“Thank you,” she said in a scratchy whisper.
She looked at Gabriel and smiled, knowing that we had made ourselves a new friend.
Peloyame stood at the fence alone.
“Hey?
What are you guys doing?
She’s a witch!
Have you forgotten?” Everyone ignored Peloyame.
So she kicked the ground and walked We thanked her and sat down to drink.
The other children watched us for some time, and then they came into the yard, one by one.
They picked up our tools and got to work where The next day, my best friend, Gabriel, and I took our bows and arrows and headed up to the bush behind the hill to go hunting.
“Is Shumba coming with us?” “Sure, why not?
He likes hunting,” I said.
“But he always scares the animals away.” I ignored Gabriel.
He knew that our bows couldn’t kill anything anyway, even without Shumba.
As we climbed the hill, I wasn’t thinking about the witch’s house.
But Shumba was... ne ke itse gore re tlile go tsena mo mathateng fa We collected spades and rakes and headed back up the hill.
Gabriel and I knocked quietly on the door.
We had a short talk with Mma Raphane.
Then we started clearing the long, dried grass in the yard.
As we worked, other children came to stand along the fence.
They stared at Peloyame came too.
She saw me and shouted, “Tebogo, are you crazy?
Aren’t you afraid of the witch?” “She’s not a witch!” Gabriel shouted back angrily.
Just then Mma Raphane came out with two glasses of cool water.
I looked at the house up on the hill.
Its pink peeling paint fading in the hot Botswana sun.
Tall grass filled the yard.
Anything could be hiding in that grass.
A shiver ran down my spine.
I turned to Peloyame.
She was explaining to Kitso how witches like Mma Raphane used stolen cats in their powerful medicine.
It was getting late.
I knew I’d be in trouble if I didn’t get home.
“Listen, guys, I have to go!” I left them in the hedge busy with their witch talk.
Get story active!
Here are some activities for you to try.
They are based on all the stories in this edition of the Nal’ibali Supplement: The witch who lives on the hill (pages 5, 6, 11 and 12), Can Little Pig fly?
(pages 7 to 10) and The lazy chameleon’s trick (page 14).
The witch who lives on the hill What was so scary on the hill?
What could you do to find out for If rumours about someone are false, what could you do to change what other people think about that person?
What did the children find out?
Is there someone in your community, or school, who people say nasty things about?
Have you found out for yourself if those things are true?
Can Little Pig fly?
Why do you think Little Pig didn’t give up trying to fly?
Is there something that you really want to do?
What is it?
Ask open-ended questions (questions that cannot be answered by saying “yes” or “no” and instead can be answered in different ways).
For example: Do you think the animals treated Little Pig well?
Why or why not?
Is hope and having dreams the same thing?
Why or why not?
Do you agree with the cow that we should always have hope?
Why or why not?
The lazy chameleon’s trick Was Chameleon borrowing or stealing when he took things from Hare, Frog, Tortoise and Lizard?
What is the difference between stealing and borrowing?
Why do you think it is good to pay back what Imagine that you don’t want people to know who you are.
Use old clothes, hats, pieces of material and sunglasses to change how you look.
Remember that you can also change the Itlhome fela gore ga o batle batho ba itse gore o mang.
The lazy chameleon’s trick Written by Pirai Mazungunye  Illustrated by Vian Oelofson Long ago, in the peaceful village of Mudavula, there lived a very lazy chameleon.
At that time, all the animals farmed the land to feed themselves and their families.
All except Chameleon.
Because of his laziness, he did not want to work like everyone else.
Instead, he thought up a crooked plan so that he could borrow from others and live well.
With Lizard I’ll be yellow.
Frog will see a black chameleon With Tortoise, brown I’ll be.
I will change and change my colours.
They will never know it’s me!’ One Monday morning, Chameleon went to Hare to borrow maize meal.
Before he arrived at Hare’s house, he changed his skin colour from brown to green.
When the end of the month came, the animals waited for Chameleon to come and pay them back what he had borrowed.
But Chameleon did not come.
“Please lend me some maize meal,” Chameleon asked.
First, Hare went to Chameleon’s house.
“Those of here!
Those of here!” Hare called loudly at the gate.
“And when will you pay me back?” Hare asked.
Chameleon peeped through the window.
When he saw Hare, he remembered his song.
“Aah, Mr Hare, I was green when I borrowed your maize meal,” Chameleon said to himself.
Quickly, he changed his skin colour to yellow and went to the gate to meet Hare.
“At the end of the month!” Chameleon promised.
Hare filled the empty bucket that Chameleon had brought.
Chameleon took the maize meal home, smiling as he went.
He was thinking about his crooked plan to trick the other animals.
He made up a little song to help him remember his plan.
“I am looking for a green chameleon,” Hare said surprised.
‘I will change my colours But no one will ever know.
I was green when Hare saw me, With Lizard I’ll be yellow.
Frog will see a black chameleon With Tortoise, brown I’ll be.
I will change and change my colours.
They will never know it’s me!’ “A green chameleon?
I live here alone.
I moved in not long ago,” Chameleon lied to Hare.
Hare left and Chameleon went back into his house.
“I am the clever one,” Chameleon boasted aloud, jumping onto the couch.
In the days that followed, Lizard, Frog and Tortoise also came looking for the chameleon who had borrowed rice, meat and fruit from them.
Chameleon tricked each one by changing his skin colour so that they would not recognise him.
On Tuesday, Chameleon woke up hungry.
“I can’t eat porridge every day.
I need rice!” Chameleon thought.
“I will change my skin colour to yellow and go to Lizard.
If I can trick everyone, I will not pay anyone anything!” Another month passed by.
Then Hare, Lizard, Frog and Tortoise met by a big marula tree to gather its delicious golden fruit.
Looking at his basket of marulas, Tortoise said, “A green chameleon has moved in at the brown chameleon’s house.
That brown chameleon owes me a bucket of fruit.” Chameleon went with his empty bucket to Lizard, who kindly filled it with rice.
Chameleon promised to pay Lizard back at the end of the month.
“No,” said Hare.
“A yellow chameleon stays at that house.
I am looking for the green chameleon who owes me a bucket of maize meal.” On Wednesday, after cooking some rice, Chameleon looked unhappily at his plate.
“No!
No!
Plain rice is not nice.
I need meat!” Chameleon thought for a while.
“Frog will give me meat!” he decided.
“No,” Lizard said.
“A black chameleon stays at that house.
I am looking for the yellow chameleon who owes me a bucket of rice.” Chameleon changed his skin colour to black and ran to Frog’s house with his empty bucket.
Frog filled his bucket with meat.
Again, Chameleon promised to pay Frog back at the end of the month.
“No,” Frog said.
“A brown chameleon stays at that house.
I am looking for the black chameleon who owes me a bucket of meat.” “I am missing fruit.
I need it!” Chameleon thought on Thursday.
“Who has fruit?” Chameleon thought, scratching his head.
“Tortoise!
Yes, Tortoise!” Then Lizard said, “Could it be that one chameleon has tricked us all by changing his skin colour?
Let’s all go to the house at the same time.” So Hare, Lizard, Frog and Tortoise marched to Chameleon’s house and shouted for him to come out.
Chameleon changed his skin colour to brown and went to Tortoise with his empty bucket.
He asked Tortoise for fruit, and Tortoise filled his bucket with bananas, oranges and apples.
“Thank you, thank you, Mr Tortoise.
I will pay you back at the end of the month,” he promised.
Chameleon peeped through the window at the angry animals.
He felt ashamed that his laziness had brought him so much trouble, so he went out and begged Hare, Lizard, Frog and Tortoise to forgive him.
All the time Chameleon kept singing his song so that he would remember his colour tricks.
Hare, Lizard, Frog and Tortoise agreed to forgive Chameleon.
“But never again will you get anything from any one of us,” they said.
‘I will change my colours But no one will ever know.
I was green when Hare saw me, And from that day on, the lazy chameleon had to work for his food just like Segwagwa se tla bona Leobu le lentsho tshele sentle.

Long, long ago, hares had beautiful, long, fluffy white tails, which they wagged whenever they felt happy or excited.
At that time, all the hares lived on an island, separated from the mainland by a wide, foaming river.
Though the hares knew how to swim, they could never reach the mainland, because in this river lived dozens and dozens of big, green, hungry crocodiles.
These crocodiles loved nothing more than delicious hare for breakfast, lunch and supper.
One day, an especially frisky young a brilliant idea.
“Guess what?” he boasted to his friends.

We are 10 years old!
This year, the Nal’ibali reading-for-enjoyment campaign is celebrating its 10th anniversary!
In 2012, Nal’ibali was launched as a national reading-forenjoyment campaign.
Its aim was to spark and embed a culture of reading across South Africa so that reading, writing and sharing stories – in all of the South African languages – would become part of everyday life.
To make that vision a reality, Nal’ibali has produced many wonderful stories for children in all of the South African languages.
These stories are shared in our bilingual supplement, as printed books and radio stories, on our website and via social media, so that every child can enjoy a story every day!
Every child from 0 years onward Even babies can – and should – enjoy a story every day.
Children learn to read by first being read to and then learning how to do it for themselves.
The more you read aloud and talk to babies, the more words they hear.
Sharing books with pictures, rhymes and stories helps teach them vocabulary and language – and gets their brains thinking!
These are skills critical for school success, and it is up to us as adults and caregivers to model the behaviour of reading from an early age.
Every day for just 15 minutes Taking time out from a busy day to read to your children shows them how important they are to you.
Reading to your children every day: makes it an enjoyable habit and helps them become lovers of books and life-long readers.
means you are making time for them.
The memory of satisfying story times with you will stay with your children throughout their lives.
Enjoy stories as a family One of the wisest investments we can make in our children is listening and talking to them and doing things together.
These things happen naturally when families spend even a short time together each day, telling and reading stories together.

“Clang-a-lang!” went the school bell and Thoko “Thoko and Brendan,” announced Mrs McKensie, looking through the reading lists.
Brendan had read five books and Thoko had read six!
She felt like melting with happiness as Mrs McKensie placed a gold star on her forehead.
Shane, Rhapelang, Corne and Taitum all got yellow stars.
Gift, Gaswin, Aydon, Chleo and Kay-Lee got red stars.
Roche, Shaunique and Miscka got green stars.
And Dana Rose, who had managed to wash green glitter off her fingers during break, received a blue star.
Then Thoko heard her name called.
The final period of the school day was a free one, so Thoko decided to read.
And while she read, she forgot all about time − first one book, then another and another.
By the time she had added the titles to her reading list, Mrs McKensie was ready to announce the star winners.
Thoko helped Mrs McKensie hand out worksheets.
Friday’s worksheet was all about time − and it was going far too slowly for Thoko.
If only she could make all the hands on the drawn clocks spin and stop at Star Awards Time!
During music, she couldn’t wait for the last line of a new song to end.
Waiting for the Star Awards was painful.
Sparking children s potential through storytelling and reading.
Lately, Thoko had made a special effort with her reading – to read with expression, to pause after a comma and to stop at a full stop to catch her breath.
The best reader was Brendan, who the children called “Greedy Eyes” because he devoured so many books.
Friday was also great because Thoko got money to buy a treat on her way home.
And this Friday was an extra lucky Friday because Thoko reached the car park just in time to help Mrs McKensie carry her big bag to the classroom.
Maybe she’d win a green star.
A gold star for reading would be better, of course.
Stars were always awarded just before the school bell rang and everyone rushed out to meet their mums, dads, grannies or aunts in the playground.
Everyone, except Thoko, who lived close by and could walk home.
Thoko lived with her mama at the back of her Gogo’s dressmaking shop.
So far, Thoko had earned a yellow star for her maths sums, a red star for her neat writing and a blue star for “clean hands”.

Josh lifted his arms and then he sang: “Sway left, sway right.

Do what I do,” he shouted.
“Well, let’s have a paper aeroplane competition,” said Afrika and took out a drawing of his paper aeroplane.
“No,” said Josh.
“Let’s fly!” They all laughed, put their arms out … and flew home.
Hope looked at her watch.
“We’re late for lunch,” she “Home,” laughed Neo, “I’m hungry!” “Now you know that you don’t have to be in a real aeroplane to be able to fly,” said Josh.
The next day everyone was up early.
“If I know your friends,” said Mme wa Afrika, “they will be here before you’ve finished your breakfast.” Just then everyone heard barking.
“And Noodle,” agreed Gogo.
Gogo laughed and gave them each a slice.
“Josh, Hope and Bella will visit tomorrow,” she said.
Mbali looked around.
“Yum, yum,” she said pointing at the cake.
“… and aeroplanes,” said Neo as he walked into the room with Mbali.
Afrika jumped up to greet his friends.
He was so happy to see them again.

Afrika tried to sit still, but he couldn’t.
“I wish this old bus was an aeroplane,” he said as he put his arms out and pretended they were aeroplane wings.
“If we were flying, we would have been at Gogo’s house long ago.” “I know,” said Mama, “but please put your arms down before you poke your fingers in someone’s eye.” “Eish, this bus is so slow,” sighed Afrika.
“We’ll never get there.” It took hours, but at last the bus stopped and they could see Gogo waving to them.
“I was so excited that I got here early,” said Gogo as she hugged and kissed them all.
“We were on this bumpy, noisy, old bus for so long, “I know,” smiled Gogo.
“Now, let’s get you all home.
I have tea and cake waiting and Neo and Mbali will be home soon.” That made Afrika smile all the way to Gogo’s house.
“Noodle, slow down!” Bella shouted, as she followed Noodle into the room.
Noodle was very happy to Soon Josh and Hope arrived and everyone started talking at once.
Gogo covered her ears.
“Finish eating, then off you go!” Gogo said and sent the older children and Noodle outside to play.
“Josh,” said Afrika, as he pushed the wheelchair to the field, “remember the last time I was here and you won the kite competition?” “Yes,” laughed Josh.

She couldn’t wait to show Mama and Gogo her gold star.
When she reached Mrs Ismail’s spicy doughnut stand, her face was hot from running.
Mrs Ismail’s little daughter, Sharifa, was pretending to be a shopkeeper.
She handed Thoko a spicy doughnut in a paper bag and smiled sweetly.
“Thank you,” said Thoko and sped off.
“Mama!
Gogo!” she called, bursting through the front door, “Look what I got?” Gogo looked up from her sewing and Mama peeped around a corner.
“Molo, Thoko!” they said.
“How was school?” Gogo looked while Thoko pointed to her forehead.
“Look at what, Thoko?” Thoko impatiently.
“What gold star?” “This one,” said across her forehead.
But all she felt was smooth skin!
The gold star was Thoko burst into tears as she explained how she had received a gold star for reading.
“Where did you have it last?” asked Mama.
“At school,” replied Thoko.
“And what did you do after school?” In tears, Thoko went over her route from school.
“Well, it’s only a paper star,” said Mama.
But it wasn’t.
It was a very special gold star.
“Dry your tears and we”ll go and look for your Gogo helped Thoko retrace her steps around the corner and along the road back to school.
And there at Mrs Ismail’s doughnut stand they found Thoko’s gold star − stuck to the forehead of Mrs Ismail’s little girl!
When Mrs Ismail heard Thoko’s sad story, she said, “Sharifa darling, that gold star you picked up belongs to Thoko.” But little Sharifa had fallen in love with Thoko’s gold star.
And when Mrs Ismail tried to remove it, she screamed so loudly that passers-by thought she Gogo turned to Thoko.
“Sharifa’s too small to understand what is fair.
But you are old enough to be thoughtful.
Let star,” she said.
Thoko thought for a while.
The corners of the gold star had curled up, and it looked as if it was about to fall it.” But inside, she still felt sad.
Gold stars were not that easy to win.
Then at bedtime, Gogo brought Thoko something special she had made – a glittery gold star on a hairclip.
“That’s for being such a good reader,” said Gogo.
Then she kissed Thoko on the forehead and whispered, “And that’s for being such a kind, thoughtful girl.” Thoko touched her forehead and thought a little more as she drifted off to sleep: “Gold stars get curly corners and fall off.

Find some stories and bring them Illustrations by Tamsin Hinrichsen Story by Wendy Hartmann Even though Hope’s plan did not quite work out, it was a day they would all remember!
Then Hope explained her plan and how it had gone wrong.
The mayor listened, and when Hope had finished, he just looked at her … and then he started laughing.
“Well, now you can write your own scary creature story,” the mayor suggested.
Neo, Josh, Hope, Bella and her mom raced over to help.
They found the mayor on the ground next to the creature with Noodle still barking at it.
The children helped to calm Noodle down while Bella’s mom helped the mayor up.
The children hid behind the bush and loosened the kite’s string.
A strong gust of wind took the creature off into the sky.
Up, up, up it went, racing across the sky away from them.
In the meantime, Bella and her mom had arrived at the park to walk Noodle.
When Noodle saw the creature dangling in the sky, he started barking and pulling on his leash.
Bella tried to hold onto Noodle’s leash, but he pulled so hard that she had to let go.
Off went Noodle across the park.
Bella and her mom chased after him.
Then the creature started to float down towards the mayor’s head as he was making his speech!
Noodle was running towards him still barking at the creature – and Bella and her mom were not far behind.
Josh pulled on the kite’s string, trying to get the creature up higher into the sky, but it was too late.
Noodle leapt up at the creature, knocking over the mayor.
Bits of paper with the mayor’s speech on it flew all over the park, and people started running in all directions.
They dressed the creature in Hope’s karate clothes and Neo’s pirate hat and eye patch.
Josh tied the creature onto his kite.
And then they were ready!
A day to remember Story by Lorato Trok Illustrations by Rico Translated by Lorato Trok “Hurry up, Neo, we don’t have much time!” said Hope putting down her heavy bag.
Hope and Josh were waiting for Neo.
They were all going to the park as part of Hope’s plan!
Hope had started hatching a plan after reading the new book her mother had bought her.
It was about a girl who had bravely saved her village from a scary creature.
Hope had enjoyed the book so much that she had finished it in a day and had even dreamt about the scary creature that night!
“I hope that what you’ve planned for us will be fun.
Why are you in such a hurry?” Neo asked Hope as he shut the front door.
Neo was wearing his favourite pirate hat and eye patch.
“I’m as clueless as you are, Neo.
Hope just asked me to bring my kite to the park,” said Josh pointing to his kite.
“Trust me, you’ll enjoy this!” said Hope as she walked off ahead of her friends.
Neo and Josh followed, trying to keep up.
When they got to the park, they saw the mayor surrounded by a large crowd of people.
“What’s going on?” Josh asked a woman standing nearby.
“Well, for a long time, the mayor got lots of complaints because there wasn’t enough shade in the park,” she said.
“So, he made sure that lots of new trees were planted and today he’s here to celebrate this with everyone.” “Oh no!
The park is too full for my plan to “What plan?” asked Neo and Josh at the same time, looking at each other.
“Do you remember the story I read about the brave girl who saved her village?” asked Hope.
“Well, I was hoping we could make a scary creature, tie it to Josh’s kite and then fly it over the park.
But now look!” said Hope pointing to the happy people standing around the mayor.
Neo saw how sad Hope was.
“Nice plan, Hope!” he said.
“Let’s go over there behind that big bush.
No one will see us there.” Josh and Hope nodded in agreement and off they went.
“Josh, you go and find some sticks.
Neo, take off your pirate hat and eye patch,” instructed Hope as she took her karate clothes and a balloon out of her bag.
Josh found some thin sticks next to a dustbin and the three friends sat behind the bush using string from Hope’s bag to tie them together in a cross-shape for the creature’s body.
Then Hope blew up the balloon and tied that on for the creature’s head.

I will take you to the sea people who know all things and all stories.” Down, down, down they went into the sea, right to the bottom, straight to the king and queen of the sea.
“And who is this?” asked the king.
“This is a woman from the dry lands above our waters,” whispered the queen.
“What is it that you want, woman of the dry lands?” asked the queen.
“Stories, your Highness.

“Oh,” he said excitedly.
“I have many carvings of animals, birds and people.
You can take them all.” Soon the woman was back at the beach with a bundle of the carvings.
Once again the turtle dived and took them down, down, down.
When the king and queen saw the carvings, they were very happy and they gave her a beautiful “For you and for your people, we give the gift of stories.

And the saddest part of all is that she had a young calf that still needs her.” “Oh no!” said Sisanda starting to cry.
“I wish there was something I could do.

Her mother tried to comfort her.
She even read Sisanda an extra story at bedtime to help her forget how sorry she felt for that baby giraffe.
Eventually, Sisanda drifted off to sleep to the sound of her mama’s birthday, Sisanda had a special treat – her parents got permission for her to have a party at the game reserve.
The giraffes at the reserve were curious about this group of people.
They stretched out their long necks for the best view of the party and they even seemed to want some of the birthday cake!
Sisanda loved the giraffes.
All animals were special to her, but it was the quiet and gentle giraffes that stole her heart.
She could spend all day watching them.

It sounds as though she’s near the book stall.
Together the children ran to the book stall, and there, right in front of it, were her arms and Afrika ran straight into them.
“I’m Afrika.
How did you learn to do that?” “I first tried walking with books on my head,” she said.
“You have to keep your head still when you walk.” She put the cooldrink bottle back on top of Afrika’s head.

Someone bumped into Afrika and the cooldrink bottle fell off his head.
But he had forgotten about the bottle – he wanted to know where his mother was!
“Where are you, Mama?” he called.
There was no answer.
“Mama!” he called a little louder.
Still no answer.
“My mother is lost!” said Afrika to Asanda.
“We were on our way to the book stall on the corner, but now she’s gone!” “I’m going to the book stall too!
I’m going to buy a storybook with the money I’ve saved.

All of a sudden Afrika “That’s my mother’s voice,” said Afrika.
“Don’t worry now, we’ve found you and Dintle.
You aren’t lost anymore.” Dintle was very happy to see her big brother.

she disappeared into the crowds of people standing in between the market stalls.
“I bet I can carry things on my head too!” Afrika said to himself.
He saw an empty plastic cooldrink bottle on the ground.
He picked it up and put it on his head, but he had to hold onto it because it kept falling off.
“Eish!” said a girl right next to him.
“I’ll show you how to do that!” She took the cooldrink bottle, put it on her head, and with her nose in the air, she walked a proud princess.
“Can I go to work with you today?” she asked her baba.
“I have a gift for the baby giraffe.” Her parents looked at each other, smiled and said, “Yes, of course you can come with us.” It was a warm but cloudy day.
Everything in the reserve seemed unusually quiet.
“I think the sun isn’t shining today because it’s sad about the baby giraffe,” said Sisanda.
A great big elephant gazed at the family “Maybe he’s wondering why a little girl is going to work with her parents,” said Sisanda’s mother.
Sisanda nodded.
“He’s going to get a surprise when he finds out,” she thought.
They found the baby giraffe standing alone.
His willowy neck drooped and his big brown eyes looked dull.
Sisanda stood as close to him as she could.
She opened her small bag and took out a book.
Then, to her parents’ surprise, she began to read to the baby giraffe.
He turned his head towards her voice and listened as if he could understand every word.
At first, Sisanda’s parents thought reading to a giraffe was a strange thing to do, but they changed their minds when they saw how peaceful he looked − “My story made him feel better,” Sisanda told her grandfather when she got home.
Sisanda went to visit the little giraffe most afternoons and over weekends.
And every time she went, she took another story to share.
The two new friends looked so good together that even passing tourists took photos of them.
Slowly the little giraffe grew stronger.
People at the game reserve were taking really good care of him and all the love from his new friend, One day the reserve manager asked Sisanda to give her new friend a name.
“I think Thokozani is a good name,” The next day the reserve manager phoned Sisanda’s teacher.
He invited all Sisanda’s classmates to come and meet Thokozani.
The handsome giraffe had grown taller and stronger in the three months since Sisanda’s first visit.
On the day of the outing, forty Grade 3 children waited eagerly for the reserve gates to open.
Then Sisanda proudly led everyone to Thokozani.
Some of the children looked at the tall giraffe in amazement.
Others giggled nervously.
Their teacher, Miss Khanyile, been so kind to him,” she said gently.
“What is his name?” asked one of the boys.

From up in the branches, Neo could see to the very edge of the world.
And there was so much somewhere out there, that it almost scared him to think of it.
But the tree held him safe, and whispered, “Go and explore.
Don’t be afraid.
It’s a wonderful, big, wide world out there.” So, Neo climbed down and went on his way across the veld.
Soon, he came across a mound of hard sand with little holes, like tiny doorways.
He could hear a million busy voices inside, and the patter of six million tiny feet running about.
But in a story, you can do anything.
There was no rain here.
So, Neo set off across the veld.
The first thing he saw was tall and brown with a strong, wooden body.
It had long, brown arms that reached up to the sky, and a big, twiggy head of leafy-green hair that swayed in the warm breeze.
“Hello,” said Neo, his eyes wide.
“What “I am a tree.

Neo looked out the window of his room at the grey view of the grey street with all the wet, grey people hurrying through the grey, pouring rain.
He couldn’t go outside, and he had already read all his books to Mbali.
Just then, Gogo came in with her hair all twiggy from the wind outside.
She was holding something.
Neo could see that it was flattish, and square-ish, and very colourful … and it could open up – just like a treasure box!
“This was my favourite book when I was as young as you,” Gogo told Neo.
“It was my door to the big, wide world.” Then, she opened the book.
On the first page was a picture of a magical place, far away from the grey, grey day.
The veld was green and gold and brown, with a great, big, blue sky above, and a warm, yellow “Wow!
Is that real?” Neo gasped.
Gogo smiled.
“Don’t you know?
All stories are real, if you believe in them,” she said.
Then she pointed to the place on the page where a little boy, just about Neo’s size, was walking across the veld.
closed his eyes and slipped away, over the hills ... across the great, brown earth … off into the big, wide world.
He heard the voices of the veld.
“It’s a beautiful day!” chirped the cicadas.
“Come away, come and play,” whispered the wind in the long grass.
Neo remembered about the grey, pouring rain, and wondered if he should be out here.

The match continued in the same way as things had gone in the first half … until there was only one Neo had the ball.
He looked around to see if there was anyone from the Diamond’s team near him.
No, he was alone.
He the ball.
Suddenly a Diamond’s player appeared.

The spectators screamed with Another Diamond’s player moved towards Neo to tackle him.
Quickly, Neo passed the Everyone held their breath as Priya took the ball and kicked it hard.
LADUMA!
The Diamond’s goalie had not even seen the ball coming!
Priya had scored a goal.
Together they ran to their teammates and coach at the side of the field, and they all dabbed.
Then Priya and Neo rushed over to Neo’s dad.
Rahul was blowing his vuvuzela loudly.
“That was an ice-cream deserving performance, Priya and Neo,” said Neo’s dad.
“Would our two heroes like that?” “Yes!
We like ice-cream,” Mbali answered for them.
They all laughed.
Neo picked up Mbali and carried her as they went to buy ice-cream.
He might not have scored the two goals he had wanted to, but he had helped his best friend score the winning goal!
And Priya?
She was happy because that was her first-ever goal for Maqhawe.
The sound played just for her.
And not a second too soon.
Just as she turned around to celebrate the goal, the referee blew the final whistle!
Maqhawe had won the game!
Neo was so pleased that he ran towards Priya and lifted her up!

He had sat there many times before.
He was sure that if his dad would allow him, as soon as his legs were long enough, he’d be able to drive the car.
It looked easy.
Rahul and Priya sat at the back on either side of Mbali.
They tickled her and she giggled.
Before everyone knew it, they were at the soccer field.
They were just in time for Priya and Neo to join their teammates from the Maqhawe Football Club for their warm up.
They were playing against the Diamond Football Club today.
“Remember to make sure that you dull the shine of those Diamonds so much, that after the match they have to change their name to the Coal Football Club,” said their coach.
Then it was time for the players to run out onto the field.
The referee blew his whistle and the match began.
Things started slowly, but they soon picked up.
There was a lot of noise as the families of the children in both teams cheered.
The ball would be on Maqhawe’s side of the field for a bit, then just as it looked as if they were going to move it into the Diamond’s half, one of those players would steal the ball away!
The match went on like this until half-time.

“Hello!” a tiny voice answered.
“We are ants.
We tell the stories of the world in here.
Do you want to hear some?” Neo loved stories, so he sat down and listened.
The ants told their stories of the veld and the forest, and of the mountains and the cities beyond.
“So many stories?” Neo asked.
“There are as many stories as there are stars in the sky,” the ants answered.
Neo waved goodbye, and went on his way across the veld.
Eventually, Neo came to a lot of water that rushed through the valley from morning till night.

Come, follow me.

So, he followed the river across the valley and between the mountains.
Together, they wandered through the afternoon and almost into night, until at last, Neo reached a hilltop.
From there, he could see a little town, washed clean by the rains and gleaming in the light of the setting sun.
Then the river gurgled gently, “Go on, go home.
There are people who love you there, waiting to share stories with you.” Neo went down, through the town.
He saw the busy streets that rushed through the town, just like rivers.
He saw houses, warm in the evening light.
Inside them, people were busy, At last, Neo peered through a window where an old gogo, with strong arms and twiggy hair like the branches of a big tree, closed a book and bent to kiss her little Neo thought about the veld and the tree and the ants and the river.
And as he watched the gogo, a rainbow lit up the little house in colours so bright it looked like a picture in a storybook.
Neo thought of his great adventure inside the pages of Gogo’s favourite storybook, and he thought of her and Mbali and home.
So, Neo slipped through the book, into his warm bed, in his cosy room, in his little house.
And that is why, whenever the world seems too grey, and his room seems too small, Neo opens a book.

I burnt my hand on that silly hot pot!” “Put it under some cold water while I fetch my first aid kit,” said Mom, and off she ran back Soon Mom was back, carrying a little white box with a red cross on its lid.
She put some ointment on Gogo’s hand and wrapped it in a bandage.
“Gogo, you can’t cook with a sore hand,” said Mom.
“You and your family must come and have supper with us tonight.” “Thank you,” said Gogo.
“Please take that silly pot of beans to add to our meal.” At supper time, Gogo and her family arrived.
Yum, yum!

Noodle was even given a tiny bit in his bowl.
Chomp, chomp!
He ate it all up.
Then lap, lap.
He drank a whole bowl of water!

They are based on all the stories in this edition of the Nal’ibali Supplement: A party at the park (pages 5, 6, 27 and 28) and The boastful little weaver bird (page 30).
A party at the park Before you read the story Ask your children to share their thoughts with you about a concert that they would like to go to.
Ask them what they would look forward to most and who they would take with them.
After you’ve read the story Talk to each other about different musical instruments, the sounds they make and where they come from.
Talk about which household items could make good instruments (e.g.
an empty coffee tin for a drum or empty bottles for a xylophone).
Choose one or two instruments that you spoke about, collect what you need to make them and listen to the sounds they make when you play them.
Ask younger children to draw their favourite part of the story.
Older children can write about a party they would like to have, what would happen at the party and who would be there.
Look at the picture below.
In each thought bubble, write what you think the character is thinking about.
Then colour in the picture.

The boastful little weaver bird Written by Nicky Webb  Illustrated by Vian Oelofson Once there was a little weaver bird that was very proud of his beautiful yellow Now there was a big snake near the river that had been sleeping through feathers and shiny black beak.
He sat on the reeds by the side of the river the winter.
When he woke up, he felt very hungry, and so he went in search shouting to anyone who would listen, “Look at me!
Am I not beautiful?
Look at of something tasty to fill his stomach.
He came across the little tortoise my bright yellow feathers!
See how my beak shines in the sun!” basking in the sun.
Tortoise took one look at Snake’s flickering tongue and beady eyes and pulled his head straight back into his shell.
Snake nudged The other birds and animals didn’t like the little weaver bird.
It wasn’t just that Tortoise a few times, but it seemed like this was just a hard shell, so he he was boastful, he was also mean.
moved on to look for something that he could sink his teeth into.
“Hey, Crocodile!” shouted Weaver, “You have really ugly teeth.
They are big Soon Snake spotted Mouse, who was gathering seeds and other tasty and jagged and yellow, and you have bits of meat stuck in them!
Sies!
I bet treats for her lunch.
He slithered towards her, trying to make as little noise you wish you had a beautiful beak like mine!” as possible, but his grumbling stomach gave him away.
Mouse shot off Crocodile slid under the water and thought about how nice it would be if as fast as her little legs could carry her and squirmed quickly down to the Weaver was stuck in his teeth!

She lay there quietly, not moving a whisker.
Snake prodded the leaves for a bit, but his tummy was now growling loudly.
When it was time for Weaver to build a nest, he went about it in his usual He was too hungry to dig through all those leaves for a meal as small as boastful way.
Instead of choosing bits of grass and reed and feathers like the Mouse, so he moved on.

When he was done, his nest sparkled and Soon he found himself down by the river.
There, the strangest thing caught twinkled in the sun.
“Hey, everybody,” shouted Weaver.
“Look at my nest!
Isn’t his eye.
It looked just like a nest, but it sparkled and blinked in the bright it magnificent?
See how it shines in the sun!” sunlight.
Snake spotted Weaver flying into the nest.
“Funny that a bird would not try to hide his nest from a hungry snake,” said Snake to himself.
He crept silently towards the river and wound his way up the reeds to Weaver’s nest.
Luckily, just as he was about to poke his head into the nest and eat the little bird, he was spotted by the other birds, who shrieked and cheeped a warning.
Weaver shot out of his nest just in time and managed to get away, but Snake knocked the beautiful nest to the ground, where it A tortoise ambled past the reeds and stopped to look at Weaver’s strange nest.
“Don’t you wish that you had a home like mine, Tortoise?” tweeted Weaver.
“Yours is very dull and boring.
See how mine sparkles.” Tortoise shook his head.
“I am happy with my shell, Weaver.
It keeps me safe, and that is all that is important to me.” Next, a little field mouse poked her head out of a pile of dry leaves.

Tell us a story!
How often have your children said, “Tell us a story, please?” You may remember what it feels like to be completely wrapped up in a story – it’s like everything around you disappears and you are part of the story!
Children love hearing stories, and they are a great way to stimulate their imagination and their use of language.
Here are some tips to help you be a magical storyteller for your children.
botshelo jwa dilo tsotlhe bo a ema mme o akanya fela ka leinane!
Which stories should I tell?
Get going.
It’s always easiest to start with what you know, so start by telling stories that you know well.
Find more stories.
Keep adding to the number of stories you can tell by finding new ones.
Look in books and on the internet.
Translate stories that are only available in one language into the language(s) you are comfortable telling stories in.
How do I tell a story?
Choose your words.
Try to choose interesting and expressive words that help your listeners to build a picture in their heads as they listen to the story.
Use expression.
Tell the story with expression in your voice, and give Use your whole body.
Use your face to show the expressions of different characters in the story.
For example, frown when a character is shouting and cross about something.
Use body gestures, like swaying gently from side to side to show how a tree moved in a gentle breeze and then using bigger movements to show how it moved as the wind tlhogong fa a reeditse leinane.
the characters different sounding voices, like a squeaky voice for a little mouse and a deep, booming voice for a lion.
Match with your audience.
Choose a story to tell that you think will interest your listeners and is appropriate for their ages.
For example, most children enjoy stories that have animals in them, but stories with evil spirits in them may scare very young children.
What do good storytellers do?
Practise.
If you are telling a story to a group of children, practise in advance so that you know the story well.
Enjoy yourself.
If you enjoy telling a story, then it is likely that your children will enjoy listening to it too!
So, relax and have fun!

But before Little Mouse could answer, he ordered her to take him to that animal.
Little Mouse said, “Sir, this animal has also expressed the wish to So, they set off, Mighty Lion following Little Mouse.
She led him to a cave she knew was nearby.
It was the perfect place for her plan.
When they got there, she said, “Your Lordship may enter.
I will wait just outside the door.
The animal stronger than Your Lordship said the meeting must be between just the two of you.” Growling, Mighty Lion entered the cave.
As soon as he was safely inside, Little Mouse closed the mouth of the cave with a huge rock she’d put nearby for that purpose.
It was dark inside.
Mighty Lion narrowed his eyes to see better.
But, hard as he looked, he could not see anyone in the cave.
After a while, with a loud voice, Mighty Lion asked, “Where is this goofy animal that I will crush to bits and pieces?
When I’m through with him, I swear not even his mother will recognise him!” When Little Mouse heard Mighty Lion’s question, she put her mouth to a little crack between the rock and the door of the cave and said, “Patience, Your Lordship.
This animal will soon show itself.” By now, the sun was setting.
Soon, night fell, and Little Mouse went home for the night.
She left Lion fuming and growling in the cave.
At the crack of dawn the next day, Little Mouse was back at the door of the cave.

Every day utlwalang gore, “Motlotlegi a mogwetlhi ga a ise a tle?” many of us die to provide a feast for his bottomless pit of a stomach.
He is eating us up faster than we can produce babies.
He even eats the little ones.
They don’t get a chance to grow up!” “Soon, there won’t be any of us left,” Rhino said.
Monkey screeched, “Soon, soon, we shall be history!
History!” The big question of the day was: How to stop the massacre?
Then Elephant asked, “Does anyone have any suggestions?” Oh, there were many suggestions, I can tell you.
But, as fast as they came, they were discarded.
Finally, after many plans had been suggested and rejected, a small voice said, “Ladies and gentlemen, I have a plan!” All eyes turned towards the sound, and everyone was surprised to see who had spoken those brave words.
Little Mouse said her piece.
“To show you how much I believe in my plan, I shall carry it out all by myself.” “You?” Giraffe bellowed, unable to stop the giggles.
“What do you think you can do to Mighty Lion?” Now the other animals joined in and laughed at Little Mouse.
Little Mouse narrowed her little eyes.
Her little tail trembled and quivered.
She would show these big animals.
She would show them – yes, she would.
Finally, the laughter stopped.
The animals saw there was no other plan on the table.
They had to accept Little Mouse’s plan.
“All I ask for is two weeks in which to carry out my plan,” Little Mouse said.
By then, she said, she would have tamed Mighty Lion, and he would no longer gobble them down at will.

Why dassies have no tails Written by Themba Mabaso  Illustrated by Vian Oelofson Long, long ago, animals had no tails.
They were very unhappy about this, so they called a meeting at the watering hole.
Dassie watched as the animals passed by on their way to the meeting.
“Hurry up!
We need to get to the meeting,” shouted Hare as she hopped by.
“Don’t worry, I’ll follow you!” answered Dassie and he turned his back towards the rays of the warm sun.
“Aren’t you joining us?” asked Monkey as he passed by.
“Don’t worry, I’ll be on my way soon,” replied Dassie lying on his back to warm his tummy.
The last animal to come by was Dassie’s best friend, Tortoise.
“Aren’t you coming to the meeting?” she asked.
“Only if my friend can give me a lift,” replied Dassie.
“But my shell is already heavy,” said Tortoise.
“Well, I’m not heavy.
You won’t notice any difference with me on top,” said Dassie with a wide smile.
“But my shell is hard and uncomfortable to sit on,” explained Tortoise.
“I’m a dassie!
I’m used to sitting on hard rocks!” replied Dassie, jumping on Tortoise’s back.
Dassie was heavy, but what could Tortoise do?
Dassie was At the meeting, the animals talked about tails.
“I look ugly without a tail,” complained Hyena.
“When I try to turn when I’m running, I fall over because I do not have a “I need an extra limb to free my hands when I swing on the trees and pick “Not today.
I’m feeling lazy.
I’m just going to sit on this rock and enjoy the sun.
Please fetch a tail for me and drop it off on your way home,” said Dassie with a wide smile.
“I would love a long, bushy one.” Tortoise was surprised that Dassie was not coming along.
“Will do,” she said happily, realising that at least she would not have to carry Dassie on her At dawn, the other animals made their way to the river in a large group.
They were faster than Tortoise, so they passed her along the way.
But Tortoise was determined to reach the tree to get a tail for herself and her friend, so she As the animals neared the river, they saw the tree filled with tails.
There were short tails, long tails, bushy tails and thin tails.
There were beautiful tails and ugly tails.
The animals started to move towards the tree.
It was clear that whoever reached it first would have the best choice of tail.
Monkey jumped from tree to tree.
Lion, Cheetah and Zebra sprinted.
Elephant and Rhino made a clumsy dash.
Jackal trotted faster as did Pig, but Pig stopped here and there to eat some tasty grubs and roots.
Tortoise followed at the back.
Monkey was first to get to the tree.
She grabbed the longest tail.
Cheetah was second and he took another long tail.
The next animals chose tails from the ones left hanging on the tree.
When Pig and Tortoise finally arrived, there were only two tails left.
One was a short, stubby tail and the other a thin, curly one.
Pig chose the curly tail, so Tortoise got the chubby one.
There was nothing left on the tree, and no one had remembered that Dassie wanted a tail too.
“Let’s ask the Creator to give us tails,” suggested Lion.
So, the animals turned their faces up to the sky.
“Oh, Creator, please give us tails!” they pleaded.
A loud voice boomed from the sky.
“Tomorrow morning, go down to the river and there you will find tails on the big tree.” The animals returned home feeling hopeful and happy.
“I can’t wait to get a tail.
Tomorrow, let’s go together to fetch our tails,” said Dassie as Tortoise dropped him at the rock he called ‘home’.
Knowing that she moved slowly, Tortoise woke up early the next morning.
It was still dark when she left her home, and the other animals were still As Tortoise passed Dassie’s home, she shouted, “Come on!
Let’s go and From his rock, Dassie could see the animals coming home.
They walked with a swagger and swung their tails from side to side.
“I cannot wait to get my new tail!” thought Dassie.
Tortoise?” asked Dassie as they drew nearer.
“No, I’m sorry, my friend, but they ran out!
Pig and I got the last two tails.
Look at my tail,” explained Tortoise, pointing to her stubby tail.
“This is all I could “I should have gone myself!” said Dassie regretfully.
“I am faster than both of you.
I could have got myself a really nice tail if only I had not been so lazy.” Tortoise and Pig walked away in silence.
And that’s why dassies don’t have tails – but they still sit on rocks to enjoy the warmth of the sun!

For example, it is very important that books for babies and pre-schoolers are in their home language wherever possible.
Reading in your home language and the desire to keep reading.
Wordless books with pictures give you the chance to tell a story to your child in your own way.
Your child can create their own stories too.
Wordless books are great for children and adults who speak different languages.

Choose books that have things that are familiar to your children – for example, the homes look like their homes, and the story lets them explore life events they know about or come across.
Choose books about new things so that your children become interested in different places and cultures.
Choose different kinds of books like school stories, space stories, family and friendship stories, nature stories, stories about history, adventures, fantasy and mysteries.
Reading for information Books about everyday life – like a new child in the family, parents’ divorce or a test of friendship – can help children understand their feelings and cope with challenges.
Some books can also help you to talk about things that may be embarrassing or difficult, like sex, illness and death.
Information books awaken interest in the natural and physical world.
Reading about the experiences of people involved in politics, art, music, medicine and science can motivate young people to decide on what to do with their lives.
Information books broaden children’s knowledge, and they learn about where and how to find information.

“O-oh, forgot something,” Lifa said aloud when she saw Mr Mzi run back into the house.
In seconds, he was out again.
He slid into the car, started the engine ... and the car sped away.
But the story does not end there!
Mr Mzi told the story of Lifa, the good samaritan, to the local newspaper.
The story and Lifa’s picture was on the front page of the newspaper, and she was called onto the stage at school and given an award for honesty.
Mr Mzi was overjoyed.
He bought a huge supper for Lifa and her mother that night.
And he gave Lifa a handsome reward for her honesty – ten per cent of the full amount.
He called it a finder’s fee.
Lifa shook her head.
“I guess Mr Mzi will be very glad to see it again!” “Fifty thousand rand!” Ma said in a hushed voice.
“I have never ever seen that much money in my entire life!” “Can I count it?
Before we take it to Mr Mzi, can I count it?
Please?” Ma smiled.
She had to help Lifa count the money.
There was too much for Lifa to count all by herself.
“Oh, no!” Lifa gasped.
She quickly opened her door and ran out of the house shouting, “Wait, Mr Mzi, wait,” waving her arms wildly.
But the car disappeared around the corner as the parcel skidded across the roof of the black car and fell off onto the road.
Lifa bent down to pick up the parcel.
The paper on the side had ripped open.
Lifa nearly fell over with shock.
Soooo mu-uch money!
For a long moment, Lifa stood rooted to the spot.
She was sure Mr Mzi would soon be back.
“Surely he’ll come back for his parcel,” she said.
But Mr Mzi did not come back.

Not so long ago, in fact in the time when my great-great-grandmother was a young girl, a chicken and a cow were friends.
One day, as they walked along the fields, Chicken fluffed her feathers and wiggled her tail feathers.
She was fidgety.
Cow noticed this as she slowly “Not wise, not wise,” called Swallow from above.
“The Great Green Wood is full of wild animals and this is the time the big cats roam around looking for a delicious meal – such as a tasty cow or chicken.
You are running from a bad situation to an even worse one, I would say.” “What is wrong, Chicken?” Cow asked while she swished her tail.
“Well, we can’t go back …” Cow said, looking around anxiously.
“Do you hear that?” Chicken looked around the fields, and then back at Cow.
“Why not?” Swallow chattered.
“All you have to do, is show the farmer that there is a better way.” “No,” said Cow.
“Am I supposed to hear something?” Cow turned her head this way and that way so that the huge old bell around her neck jingled and jangled.
It created a very loud noise which rolled across the dewy fields.
“A better way?” clucked Chicken.
She could not believe what she was hearing.
“Yes,” said Swallow.
“Remember that I am the advisor to the King.
I know these things.
You need to show the farmer your real value.” “That’s exactly what I mean,” said Chicken.
“There are no other animal sounds on this farm.
And why do you think that is?” For the rest of the evening the three sat together thinking and talking and coming up with a plan.
Cow continued chewing her cud while considering the question.
Now, luckily the Great Green Wood was a place of magic where anything was possible, so Swallow sent all the birds of the forest out to gather as many vegetable seeds as they could find.
“Because,” Chicken rudely interrupted Cow’s thinking, “the farmer has shipped all our friends and family off to the slaughterhouse.” Cow got such a fright that she swallowed the cud she was chewing in one big gulp.
This made her burp loudly and in a With all the seeds gathered carefully, Swallow looked at the two friends.
“You have to take all these seeds back to the farm and plant them in the fields the farmer has prepared.
But each seed must be in the ground before the magic hour.” Swallow looked at Chicken and Cow and up at the moon.
“You must be quick.
There are a lot of seeds here and not much time.” “We have to escape because one of us is next!
We need to get away before that Chicken and Cow struggled to carry all the seeds between just the two of them, but before long they were busy in the fields planting the seeds as fast as they could.
Just as Chicken was covering the last of the seeds with some soil, the magic hour struck and Unkulunkulu opened the sky.
Soft rain fell on the newly planted fields and all the differing kinds of seeds started sprouting and growing.
Soon there were vegetables growing as far as you could see.
The farmer’s fields “Escape?” Cow asked while looking at Chicken with big eyes.
When the farmer walked out to his fields that morning, he could not believe his eyes.
Not only were there baskets of fresh neat rows, but there were also plenty of eggs and many buckets of fresh milk.
Chicken and Cow stood nearby the farmer knew this was all the result of their tonight!
But we must be careful of the farmer.

Cow nodded in agreement.
That evening, as soon as the lights in the farmhouse went out and they could hear the farmer snoring, Chicken and Cow set off.
Chicken used her beak to hold onto the clapper of the bell around Cow’s neck.
They had to be as quiet as possible if they wanted their escape to Once they were in the Great Green Wood, Chicken let go of Cow’s bell and they stood silently listening for a while.
They had no idea where they were going and they were a bit scared.
The farmer was very grateful and from that day on, the farmer, Chicken and Cow lived happily together on the farm.
From a branch above them, came the call of a swallow.
“Hey strangers!
Here!
Up here!
Are you lost …?” Swallow wanted to know.
“No, we are not.
We are escaping from the farm because the farmer had all our friends and family sent to the slaughterhouse.

Get caught reading with your family!
Is reading part of your family’s daily life?
If not, a great way to get started is to join the Get-Caught-Reading movement during the month of May and help your children discover the magic of books and stories.
Books and stories can help us to learn about other people, animals and places without ever leaving home!
Get the whole family reading!
Many research studies show that the more children read at home, the better they do at school.
If your children learn that reading can be enjoyable and entertaining, they will want to read more and more.
This is how they can build a satisfying, lifelong relationship with books and reading.
Having special time to read together makes the bond between family members stronger.
You will also have enjoyable things to talk about throughout the day.
Families who read and talk about many different kinds of books learn about different ways of thinking, different cultures and different behaviours.
This helps the family better understand other people and different ways of doing things.
Reading helps us to find new hobbies, different kinds of foods to prepare and eat, places to visit, ways to solve problems and can add Make reading a part of your family’s everyday life and include the whole family!

party for Every year since 2013, when we held our first World Read-Aloud Day campaign, Nal’ibali has been leading literacy change in South Africa by motivating adults to read with their children through its World Read-Aloud Day activities.
A focus on families Our goal was always to reach more and more children on World Read-Aloud Day each year.
In 2022, we changed our focus from reaching the highest number of children to reaching out to families.
Research shows that families who take part in World Read-Aloud Day programmes make a habit of reading and sharing stories and that it can help to break the cycle of poverty when family members can read and write.
Our goal is to sign up 1 million families who will pledge to read regularly to their children over the next three years.
schools play a key role in teaching children the mechanics of reading, families play an equally key role in helping children to fall in love with stories and books.
Chief Operating Officer of Nal'ibali, Literacy starts at home – in the home language This year we commissioned Mabel Mnensa to write a new story, A party at the park, which features the Nal’ibali characters.
Because of the importance of reading in one’s mother tongue, the story was made available in the 11 official South African languages as well as in South African Sign Language and Braille, thanks to a partnership with SLED (Sign Language Education and Development) and Blind SA, respectively.
Nal’ibali is reaching out to share its reading resources in the home languages of as many children as possible within and beyond South Africa’s borders.
As part of this pan-African approach, we also translated the World Read-Aloud Day story into Swahili, Shona, French, Chichewa, Portuguese and Lingala and invited neighbouring African countries to join the celebration.
South African children's author, By highlighting the importance of reading enjoyable stories to children in their home language every day, we hope to encourage all South Africans to help grow children’s literacy, whether at home, at school or in the community.

Then they cleaned the chairs that the old people used when they sat in the sun.
Sharon did her work as quickly as she could so that her dad could take her to see an angel.
“I don’t know.
I’m just wondering how I will recognise an angel if I don’t know what to look for,” Sharon said.
They swept and dusted and polished until everything was sparkling and clean.
“Next, we’ll clean the dining hall,” said Dad.
Then she finished her snack and put her plate and cup in the kitchen sink.
Sharon and her dad washed their hands and faces and went to the dining hall.

“Hurry up, Neo, we don’t have much time!” said Hope putting down her heavy bag.
Hope and Josh were waiting for Neo.
Hope had started hatching a plan after reading the new book her mother had bought her.
It was about a girl who had bravely saved her village from a scary creature.
Hope had enjoyed the book so much that she had finished it in a day and had even dreamt about the scary creature that night!
“I hope that what you’ve planned for us will be fun.
Why are you in such a hurry?” Neo asked Hope as he shut the front door.
Neo was wearing his favourite pirate hat and eye patch.
Hope just asked me to bring my kite to the park,” said Josh pointing to his kite.
“Trust me, you’ll enjoy this!” said Hope as she walked off ahead of her friends.
When they got to the park, they saw the mayor surrounded by a large crowd of people.
“What’s going on?” Josh asked a woman standing nearby.
“Well, for a long time, the mayor got lots of complaints because there wasn’t enough shade in the park,” she said.
“So, he made sure that lots of new trees were planted and today he’s here to celebrate this with everyone.” “Oh no!
The park is too full for my plan to work,” said Hope, disappointed.
“Do you remember the story I read about the brave girl who saved her village?” asked Hope.
“Well, I was hoping we could make a scary creature, tie it to Josh’s kite and then fly it over the park.
But now look!” said Hope pointing to the happy people standing around the mayor.
“Nice plan, Hope!” he said.
“Let’s go over there behind that big bush.
No one will see us there.” Josh and Hope nodded in agreement and off they went.
“Josh, you go and find some sticks.
Josh found some thin sticks next to a dustbin and the three friends sat behind the bush using string from Hope’s bag to tie them together in a cross-shape for the creature’s body.
They dressed the creature in Hope’s karate clothes and Neo’s pirate hat and eye patch.
Josh tied the creature onto his kite.
And then they were ready!
The children hid behind the bush and loosened the kite’s string.
A strong gust of wind took the creature off into the sky.
Up, up, up it went, racing across the sky away from them.
In the meantime, Bella and her mom had arrived at the park to walk Noodle.
When Noodle saw the creature dangling in the sky, he started barking and pulling on his leash.
Bella tried to hold onto Noodle’s leash, but he pulled so hard that she had to let go.
Off went Noodle across the park.
In the meantime, Bella and her mom had arrived at the park to walk Noodle.
Noodle was running towards him still barking at the creature – and Bella and her mom were not far behind.
Josh pulled on the kite’s string, trying to get the creature up higher into the sky, but it was too late.
Noodle leapt up at the creature, knocking over the mayor.
Bits of paper with the mayor’s speech on it flew all over the park, and people started running in all directions.
Neo, Josh, Hope, Bella and her mom raced over to help.
They found the mayor on the ground next to the creature with Noodle still barking at it.
The children helped to calm Noodle down while Bella’s mom helped the mayor up.
Then Hope explained her plan and how it had gone wrong.
The mayor listened, and when Hope had finished, he just looked at her … and then he started laughing.
“Well, now you can write your own scary creature story,” the mayor suggested.
Then Hope explained her plan and how it had gone wrong.
Busi was a little green frog who lived with her family next to a winding river in the Drakensberg mountains.
Busi was a happy frog, but one thing made her sad.
She looked different from her brothers, her sisters, and all the other frogs.
Her face was the same.
Her body was the same.
But one of Busi’s back legs was extra long and thick.
Sometimes the other young frogs teased her about her strange leg, and this made Busi feel even worse.
“If only I looked like everybody else!” she often said with a sigh.
“If only I wasn’t so ugly!”
“What nonsense!” said Grandpa Frog.
“Grandpa is right!” said Mama Frog.
“How can such a special little frog talk such nonsense?”
But Busi didn’t believe them.
When the frogs sat croaking on the bank of the river in the long summer evenings, Busi sat behind the rest of them so that no one would see her extra long back leg.
When the frogs sat croaking on the bank of the river in the long summer evenings, Busi sat behind the rest of them so that no one would see her extra long back leg.
Further down the river, in a gloomy cave high up on the mountain lived a wicked eagle.
“Stay far away from that eagle!” Mama Frog often warned.
One day, when Busi was feeling very sad, she decided to go for a swim on her own.
“I’m too ugly to play with the others,” she thought.
“I’d rather spend the day alone.”
The little frog swam for a long time, then she crawled out of the water to rest on the grassy river bank.
Lying there in the sun, she looked up, and saw the eagle’s cave.
“I’d better not stay here!” she thought to herself.
She was about to jump back into the river when she heard voices drifting down from the cave.
“Sir,” Busi heard a child’s voice say, “I’ve swept the cave and prepared your lunch.
Please may I go down to the river while you eat, so I can wash my dress?
It’s the only one I have now, and it’s very dirty.”
“Do you think I’m a fool, little girl?” shrieked a loud, angry voice.
“If I let you go near the river, you’ll just run away!”
“Oh no, Sir,” the frog heard the child say.
“I won’t run away.
You’ll know I’m still here because you’ll hear me beating my wet dress against the rocks until it is clean.”
“Well, all right then,” the cruel eagle said, “but be quick because there’s lots more work for you to do!”
Busi watched as a young girl in a very dirty dress made her way down to the river.
She sat down on the rock next to Busi, and started to cry.
“Don’t cry, little girl,” said the frog gently, but the child just cried more.
“Oh, Frog,” she sobbed, “I’ll never be able to go home again!
That cruel eagle stole me from my village last week, and now I am his slave!”
Just then, they heard the eagle’s harsh voice calling out from his cave, “Girl, are you still there?
If I don’t hear the sound of beating soon, you’ll be in BIG trouble!”
“My friend,” said Busi quickly, “you have no time to lose!
Give me your dress, and then run away as fast as you can.
I’ll beat the dress against these rocks, and the eagle will hear the noise.
By the time he finds out you’ve gone, you’ll be home again with your mother!”
“Frog, you’re so kind,” said the girl.
“But how can a tiny creature like you beat the dress hard enough to make a loud noise?”
“Well,” said Busi, “you haven’t seen my special, strong leg yet!”
Shyly, the frog showed the little girl her long, thick back leg, which had been tucked underneath her as usual.
Then the child knew she had a chance.
She pulled off her dress and dipped it into the water.
When it was wet, she beat it against a big rock a few times.
Then she passed the dress quickly to Busi.
She kissed the frog on her forehead, whispered, “Thank you,” and ran away.
WHACK!
WHACK!
WHACK!
went the wet dress, as Busi slapped it against the rock for a long time.
Her extra long leg was so powerful that it was easy for her to make a loud noise.
It was only when the eagle again shouted for the girl to hurry up, that Busi threw the dress down, jumped into the river with a plop and swam away quickly.
“At last!” said Busi’s mother when Busi reached home.
“Where have you been?”
As she hugged Busi, she saw a glowing jewel on the little frog’s forehead, right on the spot where the girl had kissed her.
“How beautiful you are!” said Mama Frog, and all Busi’s brothers and sisters agreed.
When Busi saw her reflection in the water, she smiled a huge, wide frog smile.
She was happy that she looked so beautiful.
But even more than that, she was happy that her extra long leg wasn’t such a bad thing after all.

“I know plenty of lizards who also lay eggs, and we aren’t birds at all.
We deserve her big pile of gold.” The other animals shouted, “NOOO!” and the birds sat down.
“That is very true,” said Tortoise.
“That’s rubbish,” said the leader of the lizards.
Does anyone else have something to say about it?” There was a splash from the river, and four blue heads popped out of the water.
“We don’t care if she laid eggs, or had scaly skin,” said the fish.
“We have scales too, and we used to watch Crocodile swim underwater every day.
We deserve the big pile of gold.” The other animals shouted, “NOOO!” and the lizards sat down.
“Just look at her lying there.
The fish popped out of the river and sprayed water on the birds.
“Wait!” said Springbok.
“But all this noise woke me up.” Tortoise mumbled an apology and scuttled off into the bushveld.
We deserve the big pile of gold.” The other animals shouted, “NOOO!” and the lizards sat down.
We deserve the big pile of gold.” The other animals shouted, “NOOO!” and the lizards sat down.
Monkey, who was very naughty, picked up a stick and poked Crocodile on the side of her body.
It was Crocodile!
We deserve the big pile of gold.” The other animals shouted, “NOOO!” and the lizards sat down.
They looked at Crocodile with wide eyes.
“Hey!” she shouted.
“So you all want my gold, do you?
We deserve the big pile of gold.” The other animals shouted, “NOOO!” and the lizards sat down.
We deserve the big pile of gold.” The other animals shouted, “NOOO!” and the lizards sat down.
“Why would I eat my own relatives?
Come on, lizards.
Let’s go and have dinner.”
She would chase them away and bite them with her sharp teeth.
First, the birds, with their colorful feathers and beautiful voices, stood up to speak.
Dumi Dassie lay flat on his back, sunning his fuzzy tummy on a big, flat rock.
He was nearly asleep when he heard loud giggles.
Lazily, he opened one eye.
Two little dassies were scampering by.
“EWWWW!!
!” said one of them to the other when they were safely past the rock.
“That dassie smells BAD!” They giggled some more as they rushed off.
Dumi sighed, and flicked at a fly that was buzzing around his ear.
“It’s not fair!” he thought to himself.
“Nobody understands me.”
It was true.
Dumi smelled bad because he was dirty.
He was dirty because he never washed, but nobody knew why.
The truth was, Dumi was scared of water.
Once, when he was still a baby, he fell head first into a big muddy puddle.
Dumi couldn’t swim, but luckily, his big brother fished him out by his hind legs.
Ever since that day, Dumi couldn’t bear to be near water.
When the other dassies went to the pool every morning to wash, Dumi slunk off and hid in the bushes.
Nobody could get him to change his mind about water – not even his mother!
The days passed – the summer was very hot and there was no rain.
Dumi grew dirtier and dirtier.
His fur was greasy and matted, and he smelled horrible.
Even worse, a swarm of flies followed him wherever he went.
Dumi didn’t like this, of course, but he acted like he didn’t care.
One morning, the village elders came to talk to Dumi.
They stood far away, and Dumi saw them holding their noses and gasping for air.
“We are sorry, Dumi,” they said, “but as you know it hasn’t rained for a long time.
There are many flies around.
Flies love dirt, and you are very dirty, so the flies love you!
All these flies will make us sick … It is best that you leave this village.”
Poor Dumi!
What could he do?
Sadly, he slunk off.
He walked and walked.
The day grew hotter as the sun rose high into the bright blue sky.
His head felt heavy, and his feet were so sore!
Eventually, he felt he could not walk another step.
“I need some shade!” he said, looking around.
There weren’t many trees in this part of the veld, but he saw a small thorn tree not far away.
Slowly, Dumi limped over to this little tree.
He lay down under it, and fell fast asleep.
Many hours passed.
Dumi had been sleeping so soundly that he hadn’t seen the storm clouds gathering in the sky.
The sun had disappeared.
The sky grew dark.
The air grew cooler and cooler, but still the tired dassie slept.
At last, the rain began pelting down.
Dumi woke up.
Fat raindrops were splashing all over his body!
In the dassie village, all the dassies hid from the rain under the big rocks.
But here, there was nowhere to hide!
At first, when Dumi saw and felt the rain, he screamed and cried and rolled into a little furry ball.
“Help!” he yelped.
“Somebody help me!” But even the flies were gone, and Dumi was all alone.
Then a strange thing happened.
As the cool rain ran over his body, Dumi realised that it felt good.
Slowly, he calmed down and after a while, he even dared to open his eyes.
“The rain looks pretty,” he said, “and it makes the veld smell fresh!” Then Dumi stood up, and opened his mouth to drink the raindrops.
“It tastes good too!” he said in wonder.
He was so happy that soon he began to tap his foot and click his fingers.
That was when Dumi turned around, and danced all the way back to the dassie village, singing as he went: “The rain!
The rain!
I love the rain!
Imvula!
Imvula!
Imvula!”
Dumi arrived at the village at sunset.
None of the other dassies saw him – they were all hiding from the rain under big rocks.
Dumi didn’t care.
He was used to being alone, and anyway, he felt so happy!
He ate a few leaves for supper, crawled under a bush and fell fast asleep again.
When Dumi woke up, the rain had stopped and the village looked beautiful and fresh.
As the sun rose, a carpet of bright pink flowers burst into bloom.
“Wow!” he said, looking around.
Just then, all the other dassies came walking towards him.
They were on their way to the pool to wash. How surprised they were to see the new, clean, sweet-smelling Dumi!
“Dumi!
What happened?” they all asked, crowding around him.
But instead of speaking, Dumi began to click his fingers and tap his foot … soon he was dancing and singing again.
All the dassies joined in, as they made their way to the pool: “The rain!
The rain!
We love the rain!
Imvula!
Imvula!
Imvula!”
Get creative!
Give your children large sheets of paper and suggest that they draw pictures of how Dumi Dassie felt about water at the beginning or the end of the story – or both!
When the world was young, Dog was a wild thing.
He spent his days wandering the land alone.
At night he lay his head on his fuzzy paws and kept guard over his cave.
Nobantu, the first woman, lived in a small hut near Dog’s cave.
One evening as she walked home, Nobantu saw Dog with his head on his fuzzy paws, sleeping with one eye open, and she felt sorry for him.
“I wonder what I can do to help Dog?” she thought.
“He looks so lonely.” As Nobantu thought about a plan, Dog woke up and barked at her.
“Dog,” she called out, “you are an excellent guard.” “Yes,” Dog growled, “I’m the best guard in the whole bushveld.
My ears are so good that I can hear the smallest noise, my eyes can see in the dark, and I always sleep with one eye open.” “Amazing,” said Nobantu.
“He looks so lonely.” As Nobantu thought about a plan, Dog woke up and barked at her.
“Could you please teach me how to be a good guard?
Come to my hut tomorrow at sunset.
If you do, I’ll give you a hot meal to eat.”
Dog had never eaten a hot meal before, but it sounded good.
At sunset the following day, Dog came wandering through the bushveld towards Nobantu’s hut.
He greeted her and growled, “Now you must watch what I do.
“Did I teach you how to be a good guard?” he barked.
At sunset the following day, Dog came wandering through the bushveld towards Nobantu’s hut.
He fell asleep with one eye open.
That night he chased away a few wild animals.
In the morning Nobantu brought him a hot meal in an old tin bowl.
I’ll teach you how to be a good guard.” Then Dog lay down outside Nobantu’s hut, with his head on his fuzzy paws.
“I think I’ve nearly got it,” answered Nobantu with a smile, “but maybe you could show me again tonight.
If you do, I’ll give you a hot meal AND I’ll make a little bed for you to sleep on.” Dog licked his lips.
Dog gobbled up the meal.
The hot meal had been delicious, and he’d never slept on a little bed before.
At sunset, Dog came wandering through the bushveld towards Nobantu’s hut.
Just as she had promised, there was a little bed waiting for him.
It was soft and comfortable – much more comfortable than a cave floor – and Dog fell asleep immediately with one eye open.
That night he chased away a few wild animals.
In the morning Nobantu brought him a hot meal in an old tin bowl.
The hot meal had been delicious, and the little bed was comfortable – much more comfortable than a cave floor – and he’d never had anyone scratch his back before.
“I think I’ve nearly got it,” answered Nobantu with a smile, “but maybe you could show me again tonight.
If you do, I’ll give you a hot meal, you can sleep on the little bed again, AND I’ll scratch your back.” Dog licked his lips.
Dog gobbled up the meal.

At sunset, Dog came wandering through the bushveld towards Nobantu’s hut.
He lay down on the little bed.
Dog gobbled up the meal.
What a wonderful feeling!
Dog barked with happiness, then fell asleep on the little bed with one eye open.
That night he chased away a few wild animals.
In the morning Nobantu brought him a hot meal in an old tin bowl.
Dog gobbled up the meal.
“You know, Nobantu,” Dog barked, “for three nights in a row I’ve tried my best to teach you how to be a good guard, but you don’t seem to get it at all.
“I won’t?” asked Nobantu with a smile.
“No, I don’t think so,” answered Dog.
“The problem is that you sleep inside, your ears are too small, and you can’t see in the dark.
So, I have a better idea.
Instead of me teaching YOU how to be a good guard, I could just guard your hut for you.
In return you can feed me, give me a bed to sleep on and scratch my back.” “And what about playing?” asked Nobantu.
In return you can feed me, give me a bed to sleep on and scratch my back.” “And what about playing?” asked Nobantu.
As the sun set that night, Dog fell asleep on his little bed with a smile on his face, and both his eyes closed.

“Oh no!” gasped Motlatsi and Tshepo as their black and red kite landed on Mrs Ntshona’s roof winding itself around the TV aerial.
“Quick!
We must pull it loose!” shouted Tshepo.
Motlatsi grabbed the string and tugged.
To his horror, the TV aerial that was already old, bent over until it almost touched the tiles on their neighbour’s roof.
“Dad will be so angry!” Tshepo cried, covering his face with his hands.
“Not half as angry as Mrs Ntshona!” Motlatsi replied.
He grabbed his brother and ducked behind the garage.
“Look!
There she is!”
Sure enough, Mrs Ntshona stood outside her kitchen door with her hands on her hips.
The boys could see that she was angry.
She looked up at the roof and saw the bent aerial.
Her eyes widened.
She shook her head.
Her two eyebrows came together in the middle of her face.
She tapped her foot on the floor.
Her lips were one straight line.
“Dad told us to fly the kite only in the park and we promised we would!” whispered Tshepo to his brother.
“We’re in big trouble now,” agreed Motlatsi.
“We didn’t listen to him!
What do you think he will do?” His foot kicked the dust.
“Maybe Dad will take away our kite,” replied Tshepo, “or he won’t give us money to buy sweets again.” He stared into his brother’s eyes.
A look of disappointment passed over Motlatsi’s face.
“Yikes!
What else?”
“We broke our promise.
A promise is forever.” Tshepo sat down and put his head in his hands.
“So what happens now?” asked Motlatsi as he bit his nails.
Tshepo scratched his head.
“Dad won’t trust us again.”
“What does that mean, Tshepo?
What is trust?” ask Motlatsi.
“Ssh!
Not so loud!
Mrs Ntshona will hear us!
I think it means that he won’t believe us when we tell him something,” Tshepo whispered.
“You mean like when I said that I passed Maths at school?” asked Motlatsi, sweating.
“No, he believed that because he read your school report,” said Tshepo.
“You mean like if I tell him I ate ice-cream for lunch?” suggested Motlatsi, trying to understand.
Tshepo shook his head.
“Not exactly,” he said.
“It has to be something important.”
“Like when I lost the two rand he gave me?” asked Motlatsi.
“I told him it dropped out of my pocket.”
“He knew that was true because you had a hole in your pocket,” explained Tshepo.
“What then?
Does it mean Dad will go away and never come back?
Or will he send us away?” asked Motlatsi, about to cry.
Tshepo shook his head.
“Never!
Dad loves us!
It’s just that if you promise someone that you won’t do something, then you must not do it – ever.
And, if you promise someone that you will do something, then you must do it so the person can trust you.
Like when you promised Sibongile you’d find her new pen and you did!
Now sshh!”
Tshepo and Motlatsi peered around the corner of the garage.
They saw Mrs Ntshona look at her cellphone.
She was about to make a call.
“She’s going to phone Dad!
Oh no!
How can we stop her?” said Motlatsi.
He was about to run away when Tshepo took a risk.
He stepped out, straight into danger!
“Hello, Mrs Ntshona,” said Tshepo walking towards the fence.
“I’m so sorry about your aerial.”
Mrs Ntshona looked him up and down with her lips pinched shut.
She was breathing fast.
“A new aerial costs money you know, Tshepo.
Perhaps you must find work and buy me a new one!” Her voice rang out loud as a bell.
“My dad gives us pocket money,” said Motlatsi coming up to stand beside his brother.
“We will use our pocket money to buy you a new aerial.” He wished he hadn’t said that, but he knew he had to.
“Really?” said Mrs Ntshona as her voice rose higher.
“When do you get pocket money and how much?”
“We each get five rand a week,” they whispered together, backing away a little.
“That’s ten rand a week.
We can save up …” said Tshepo, his voice trailing off.
It could take a long time to pay for a new aerial and Dad would find out what had happened.
The brothers were so busy looking at each other helplessly that they forgot about Mrs Ntshona.
When they looked at her again, they were surprised.
Mrs Ntshona had a look on her face that was soft and dreamy.
The boys held their breath.
“Children, I had a kite once.
It was grey and pink.
I stood in the garden of my grandfather’s house in Lesotho holding its string.
It rose high into the sky.
It looked so happy.
I let it go.
I watched it sail higher and higher until I couldn’t see it anymore.”
She smiled at the boys.
“It’s okay, Tshepo and Motlatsi.
I won’t tell your father.
That old aerial was useless anyway.
I needed to buy a new one.
I’ll get the ladder and you can climb up and get your kite.”
As she walked away the brothers heard her say, “I might even have some hot chocolate and cake in the kitchen when you come down!”
The boys just looked at each other and smiled.
Get creative!
In the story, there is a description of what Mrs Ntshona’s face looks like when she is angry.
Encourage your children to draw a picture of what their face or a friend’s face looks like when they are angry.
DimphoandSello’smom had a problem.
“My feet felt like blocks of ice last night!” shetold the children one Monday morning.
“They were so cold I couldn’t sleep.
“I know!” saidSello.
DimphoandSello’smom had a problem.
“I know!” saidSello.
“They are very warm!
That night, she put on her thickest woolly socks.
DimphoandSello’smom had a problem.
“I know!” saidSello.
“Mama,” saidDimpho, “why don’t you soak your feet in hot water before you go tobed tonight?”
“I couldn’t sleep a wink,” she sighed.
“If only I could warm up my silly cold feet!”
“Mama,” saidDimpho, “why don’t you soak your feet in hot water before you go tobed tonight?”
“What a good idea!” saidMama.“My children are so clever!”
“Thank you!”
After supper that night, Mama poured hot water into a big red basin.
“Mmmm, thisfeels good!” she said, swishing her feet about.
“Mama,” saidDimpho, “why don’t you soak your feet in hot water before you go tobed tonight?”

When Mama came home from work that evening,Dimphohad some good news.“Myteacher says that drinking ginger tea makes you feel warm all over,” sheexplained.

“Mama,” saidDimpho, “why don’t you soak your feet in hot water before you go tobed tonight?”
She didn’t sound very happy.
After so many nights of not enoughsleep, she felt very grumpy!
On Saturday morning, before she leftfor work, Mama asked the children to go and buy some ginger.
When Mama came home from work that evening,Dimphohad some good news.“Myteacher says that drinking ginger tea makes you feel warm all over,” sheexplained.
“Ginger tea will warm up your feet!”
Off went the children.
“What are you looking at,Sello?” askedDimphowhenthey came to the big road near the shops.Sellodidn’t answer.
“Sello!” saidDimphoagain.
He was staring atsomething nearby.
“Sello!” saidDimphoagain.
“Hold my hand.
We need to crossthe road now.”
“Look over there!
We need to crossthe road now.”
For a small boy,Sellohad a big, loud voice.
On an empty plot, two boys aboutSello’sage were teasing a grey cat.
They laughed.The cat was trying to escape.
For a small boy,Sellohad a big, loud voice.
“STOP THAT!” he shouted.

“Yes, leave it alone!” saidDimpho.
The boys looked up.
“STOP THAT!” he shouted.

Come on,Jabs, let’s go!”
On an empty plot, two boys aboutSello’sage were teasing a grey cat.
Her children were patting a fluffy grey cat.
Her children were patting a fluffy grey cat.
“What on earth is going on?” she asked angrily.
“Why did you bring that animal home?Get rid of it right now!”
“STOP THAT!” he shouted.
“But Mama, it’s raining outside,” saidSello.
“Kitty will get wet!
Please can we keep her,just for tonight?
PLEASE?”
Her children were patting a fluffy grey cat.
The cat was purring and licking itself.Mama saw that they had fed it some leftover meat.
Now it was pouring.
“Fine,” she said with tight lips, “buttomorrow, that cat goes.”
“Hmmmph,” said Mama.
“Hmmmph,” said Mama.
She sat down, took off her shoes, and rubbed her feet.
“Whereis that ginger you bought me?” she asked.
“It’s time for my first cup of ginger tea!”
The children stared at each other with huge, round eyes.
They had forgotten to buy theginger!
Mama was very cross.
She sat down, took off her shoes, and rubbed her feet.
On Sunday morning, whenDimphoandSellowoke up, there was no sign of their mom.They were surprised – she always woke up early.
Mama was very cross.
Now it was pouring.
“Fine,” she said with tight lips, “buttomorrow, that cat goes.”
What do you think they saw?
Mama was lying in bed, lookinglazy.
The cat was curled up at her feet, purring loudly.
“Morning,” said Mama.
She sat down, took off her shoes, and rubbed her feet.
Mama was very cross.
Warm feet at last!” She looked at the cat.“I think we may have to keep you!” she told it.
“Let’s call you Ginger!” The grey, fluffy catpurred even louder.
The children laughed, clapped and bounced about.
He wasfrowning.
“But, why are we calling her Ginger?” he asked.
“Well,” said Mama, “you two went to the shop to buy some ginger, but you brought thiscat back instead.
She kept my feet warm likeDimphosaid the ginger tea would, so hername is Ginger!”
He wasfrowning.
Zinhle loved skipping in the playground with her friends Sindi and Zongi.
Just one thing worried her.
When her friends skipped, their hair flew up and down, and flicked from side to side.
Zinhle had a thick mop of soft hair that formed a big round shape, and it never moved in the same way as theirs did.
One Saturday morning Zinhle asked her mother, “Mama, why doesn’t my hair grow down like my friends’ hair?
Their hair flies about when they skip.
It looks so pretty!
It makes me sad that my hair doesn’t move like that.
It just stays still!” “Your hair may be different from your friends’ hair, but it’s just as beautiful as theirs!” said Mama.
Zinhle made a sad face, but her mama just smiled at her.
“Look around you, Zinhle,” she said.
“Your hair grows from the roots up, like the trees and plants.
It’s also round and big, just like the earth we live on.
You can play around with it too and make beautiful patterns and shapes in it.
Your hair is magical – and that is special!”
These words made Zinhle happy.
She ran outside to tell her friends about her magical hair.
But when she told Zongi and Sindi what Mama had said, they just looked at each other, and burst out laughing.
“How can hair be magic?” asked Zongi.
“Ha-ha-ha!” laughed Sindi.
“Don’t joke like that, Zinhle!
Magic?
Never!” Zinhle’s eyes filled with tears, but she didn’t cry.
She didn’t want Zongi and Sindi to laugh at her again.
Just then, the girls saw Gogo waving to them.
She was standing in her doorway nearby.
“Look, Gogo’s calling us,” said Zinhle.
The three children loved helping Gogo.
She told them lots of stories and gave them dried fruit every time they visited her.
So Zinhle, Zongi and Sindi hurried to find out why Gogo was calling them.
“I’m not well today,” said Gogo.
“I want to send you to kwaNtuli to get some medicine.” The children were sad to hear that Gogo wasn’t well and agreed to go and get her some medicine.
“I’ll draw you a map so you won’t get lost,” said Gogo.
“The map will lead you to Baba Ntuli’s place, and he’ll give you some herbs.” Then Gogo went inside to find paper and a pencil to draw the map.
She looked in her drawer, but she couldn’t find any paper.
“I’ll have to make another plan,” she said.
She looked carefully at each of the girls.
Then she said, “Zinhle, you have very beautiful hair.
It looks strong.
I will braid cornrows to make a map in your hair.
The map will help you get to kwaNtuli.” Gogo sat on her favourite red chair, and Zinhle sat on the mat in front of her.
Gogo braided Zinhle’s hair.
The other girls watched eagerly.
As Gogo combed and braided different patterns, Zongi and Sindi were amazed by the length of Zinhle’s hair.
“Wow!
Your mama is right,” said Sindi.
“Your hair really IS magical!
It looks so short, but it’s longer than you think!” “It’s true,” said Zongi.
“It’s a big surprise!”
Zinhle smiled at them happily.
When Gogo had finished braiding Zinhle’s hair, the cornrows looked just like a map to guide the children to kwaNtuli!
As they walked along the narrow paths through the veld, Zongi and Sindi often stopped and studied Zinhle’s hair to make sure that they were still going in the right direction.
While they walked, they sang a song they had made up:
“Gogo’s not well, Gogo’s not well.
We’re going to kwaNtuli, we’re going to fetch herbs – herbs to make Gogo well!” The children finally arrived at kwaNtuli.
There Baba Ntuli gave them two packets of herbs for Gogo.
On their way home the girls again used Zinhle’s cornrow map to guide them.
When they arrived safely at Gogo’s house, they gave her the medicine.
The next morning, Zinhle, Zongi and Sindi went to Gogo’s house to see if she was better.
When they arrived, they found her watering her garden.
“Good morning, my children,” said Gogo with a big smile.
“I’m feeling much stronger today, all thanks to you!” The girls were happy to hear that they had helped Gogo, but they were thinking about something else too.
“Gogo, would you please braid my hair the same way you did Zinhle’s hair?” asked Sindi.
“Mine too, please!” said Zongi.
“Of course,” said Gogo.
“Come inside.”
During news time at school the next morning, the three friends told their class all about their magic hairstyles.
At break, they had just started skipping when some children asked to see their cornrows that made a map to kwaNtuli.
“It really is magic,” said someone, and everyone else agreed.
Timo lived in a small village surrounded by mountains, green fields and beautiful forests, but his favourite place was the park.
He loved it there because he felt like a superhero when he ran around, climbed on the jungle gym and spun on the merry-go-round.
Every day when Timo came home from school, he would get changed out of his school uniform and eat the delicious sandwich that his grandmother had made for him.
Then he would do his homework and, when it was done, he would rush outside shouting, “Granny, Granny, it’s playtime!”
And Granny would call after him, “Timo, wait!
Don’t you want me to read you a story?”“No, Granny, I need to play and explore,” Timo would reply, already on his way to meet his friends who were waiting for him at the gate.
“There are many places that you can explore in storybooks, Timo,” Granny would say.
“Books can teach you lots of things and take you to places that you have never been.”Timo would giggle and say, “Granny, books can’t take me anywhere.
Only cars can do that!” Then he would run off down the road to the park with his friends.One afternoon, Timo’s best friend, Ben, was waiting for him at the gate.“Hey, Timo, are you ready to play?” asked Ben.
“I’m always ready,” said Timo racing down the street with his best friend.
They both wanted to get to the park first.When they got there, Timo’s other friends were waiting for them.
Pamela was sitting on the swing crying, while Noma and Siya were standing next to her.
They looked worried.
Timo moved closer to find out what was going on.
“What happened to Pamela?” he asked.
“She was on the swing and Siya accidently pushed it too hard.
Pamela fell off the swing and now her knee is bleeding,” explained Noma.“Oh no!
What are we going to do?” asked Ben.“It’s okay, I know what to do,” said Noma reaching for her backpack and taking out a small bag.
“What is that?” Timo asked.
“It’s a first aid kit.
I will clean Pamela’s knee and then put on this plaster so that it feels better,” said Noma.
The friends were surprised that Noma knew exactly what to do.
Once the plaster was on, Pamela said she felt much better and she wanted to play again.
All the friends felt happy and relieved and they thanked Noma.All the friends raced over to the jungle gym – except Timo.
He was wondering how Noma had known what to do.
He wanted to know where you could learn these kinds of things because superheroes are supposed to know how to help people!
Timo walked over to where Noma was climbing and asked, “Noma, how did you know what to do?”Noma smiled and said, “I read it in a storybook.”
“You learnt all of that from reading a storybook?” asked Timo.
He wasn’t sure he could believe what Noma had said.“Yes, Timo.
I want to be a doctor when I grow up so that I can help people.
When I read storybooks, I learn about how doctors help people,” said Noma.
Timo was amazed!
“I want to be a superhero and help people too.
Do you think storybooks could help me do that?” he asked.“Yes, of course!” said Noma.
“Storybooks can teach you lots of things.
Just get them from the library and start reading.”
The next day, when he got home from school, Timo changed out of his school uniform and ate the delicious sandwich that his grandmother had made for him.
Then he did his homework.He had just finished when Granny called him.
“Timo, your friends are here.
They are waiting for you to go to the park with them.”
“Please tell them I will join them later, Granny,” answered Timo.
Granny could not believe her ears!
Timo was always in a hurry to go to the park.
“Why aren’t you going right now?” she asked.“I’d like you to read me a story before I go, please,” said Timo.Granny smiled happily.
“That’s new!
Why do you want me to read you a story today?” she asked.
“Because Noma says stories can teach me how to be a superhero and help my friends,” Timo said as he jumped up and down excitedly.
“That’s my boy!” said Granny as she picked up a storybook.So, Granny and Timo sat down together and read that storybook – and another, and another.
And every afternoon after that, before Timo went to play in the park, he asked Granny to read to him.
Lolo was a clever little girl who lived in the village of the Batswanapeople.
This beautiful village was like no other in the world.
The peoplethere were really clever and they were ahead of their time.
Lolo was thesmartest of them all.In Lolo’s village, theinternetwas the most important tool.
If you visitedthe village, you’d find school children using their computer tablets to findthe information they needed to finish their schoolwork.
Many people hadcars that could fly and they controlled these cars by using theinternet.People used theinternetfor EVERYTHING!
And then one day –POOF!
Suddenly theinternetwas gone.
Everyonethought that maybe it had gone down for a while and that it would workagain later, but they were wrong.The king and queen of the village made an announcement on thecommunity radio and television stations.
They said that theinternetwould be down for a long time.
Everyone in the village was shocked.Lolo watched in amazement as every child in her school panicked.“Our lives are over!” shouted one of her friends grabbing Lolo byher shoulders.One of Lolo’s teachers ran out of the classroom, grabbed her arm andsaid, “Do something, Lolo!
You are the clever one.” Then the teacher ranoff crying.
Lolo could not understand what the fuss was about.
“Everyone isbehaving as if the world is coming to an end!” she thought.
She decidedthat the next day she would pay the king and queen a visit to find outabout the problem.When Lolo arrived at the Royal House, she was welcomed with a glassof warm milk and a plate of chocolate chip biscuits.
Lolo ate some ofthe biscuits while she waited for the king and queen.
They were the bestbiscuits she had ever tasted.
The king and queen arrived and greeted Lolo.
They began to talk aboutthe problem in the village.
The queen explained that their ministers hadfound out that the problem was with asatellite that was far, far away –all the way up in space!
“So,” said the queen, “it is not just our village, but the whole world thatdoes not have theinternet.” The queen then held Lolo’s hand and said,“My child, we are looking for someone really clever to get into the royalspacecraft, travel into space and fix the satellite.”
“Lolo,” said the king, “you are the only person for the job!
If you do this,you will be doing the whole world afavour.”
Lolo felt excited and nervous all at the same time.
She had read thatgoing into space was a dangerous thing to do, but she agreed to go.
For days, the little girl worked alongside the space crew to prepare for thisspecial mission.
She learnt how to fly and control the spacecraft and shelearnt how to float in space.
Soon Lolo was ready to fly off into space.On the day that Lolo left, everyone was there to watch.
People threwflowers at her for good luck.
Others sang songs of encouragement.
Lolofelt so loved.
Lolo climbed into the spacecraft and all the technicians turned theengines on.
Moments later, the spacecraft left earth.
After flying for whatseemed like a long, long time, the spacecraft landed at the space station.Lolo could see the satellite from the window.
She contacted the king andqueen using a special type of radio to let them know that she had arrivedsafely.
Everyone at home celebrated and her parents were especiallyhappy to know that their daughter was alive and well.
But the mission didn’t go quite as planned.
For days Lolo struggledto work out what the problem was.
She knew that the success of themission was in her hands and she didn’t want to let everyone down.Eventually the space team’s food and water began to run out.
The missionhad become very difficult, but still the clever little girl kept working andworking, until one day … she had worked it all out!
One of the cableson the satellite had burnt out and needed to be replaced.
Once Lolo haddone that, theinternetwas back!
Everyone in her village and all over theworld celebrated.
After a hard, but successful mission, Lolo returned home.
She was a hero!The king and queen were so proud of her that they gave her a medal ofhonourand named their next child after her.
Ashley was busy doing a jigsaw puzzle when her big brother, Ben, came into the lounge.
“Tomorrow is Mother’s Day,” he said.
“We should do something very special for Mom.
Will you help me?”
Ashley clapped her hands.
“Ooh yes, Ben.
Are we going shopping?”
“No, I’ve already bought her a present.
Do you want to come and see?”
Ashley followed her brother into the garage.
On the bench, hidden under a sheet, was a beautiful wooden shelf in the shape of a heart.
“I thought we could paint it blue,” Ben said.
“Ooh yes,” Ashley said.
“Blue is Mom’s favourite colour.
She’s going to love her present.”
Ben found two paintbrushes, and some sandpaper, and they got to work.
First they sanded the shelf, then they painted a white undercoat and lastly they painted it a glossy bright blue.
The shelf was beautiful.
“What are you two doing in there?” Mom asked when she came home from shopping.
“Nothing!
Go away!” called Ben.
“It’s a surprise,” giggled Ashley.
That afternoon Mom went to the hair salon.
“Quick, Ashley,” called Ben, “it’s time to put up the shelf.
Can you hold the screws and the screwdriver for me while I drill the holes in the wall?
Don’t lose the screws.
I don’t have any more.”
Ashley held the screwdriver and screws tightly while Ben measured where the shelf would go on the wall.
Ashley held the screwdriver and screws tightly while Ben measured where the shelf would go on the wall.
“There we go,” said Ben.
“Now pass me the first screw.” Carefully he screwed the shelf to the wall.
“Now pass me the other two screws, Ashley,” he said.
But Ashley could find only one screw.
The other one wasn’t in her pocket.
It wasn’t on the floor, or behind the couch.
It was gone.
It was almost 5 o’clock.
Mom would be home any minute.
“Never mind,” said Ben.
“This will do for now.
I’ll buy another one in the week.”
“What shall we put on the shelf?” asked Ashley.
“I think Mom’s best vase that her granny gave her,” said Ben.
“And her favourite candlesticks.”
“And the trophy I won at school for being the best at reading?” Ashley asked.
“Definitely,” said Ben.
“And the photo of Mom and me and you when you were a baby.
She loves that picture.”
Carefully they arranged Mom’s special things on the shelf.
Then Ben spread the sheet over the shelf so it was hidden.
A few minutes later Mom came home.
“Hello, hello,” Mom called.
“What have you two been up to?”
“It’s a surprise,” giggled Ashley, “and you’re not allowed to see what’s behind the sheet.”
“I’m very excited,” said Mom.
“I’m sure it’s something wonderful.”
“Do you promise you won’t peep?” asked Ashley at bedtime.
Her mother tucked her up and gave her a kiss and a hug.
“You are my best girl.
I promise I won’t even lift the corner of the sheet.”
It was almost morning when Ashley was woken by a loud crash.
She jumped out of bed.
Ben and Mom were standing in the lounge, staring at a terrible mess on the floor.
“Oh no,” cried Ben, “the shelf fell off the wall.”
“Oh no,” cried Ashley, “Mom’s Mother’s Day present is ruined.”
“Oh no,” cried Mom, “my favourite vase is broken into little bits.”
Everyone was upset.
Mom sat on the couch and tried not to cry.
“We’ll clean it up,” said Ben.
“Mom, you go back to bed.”
“Happy Mother’s Day,” said Ashley sadly.
Ben got the broom and swept up all the pieces of Mom’s favourite vase.
He was very upset.
“Mom’s granny gave her that vase and now it’s broken.” And he tipped the pieces into the rubbish bin.
“We’d better go back to sleep too,” said Ben to Ashley.
“It’s not waking up time yet.”
Ashley looked at the shelf lying on the floor.
It had been such a lovely present.
Now they had nothing to give Mom when she woke up.
Ashley peered inside the rubbish bin.
All the pieces of Mom’s vase were there.
Maybe she could use some glue and mend it?
She picked up the bin and ran out to the garage.
There on the shelf was a big pot of glue.
She spread some newspaper on the workbench and emptied out the bin.
There were so many pieces!
How was she supposed to know which ones went where?
“I see!” she exclaimed.
“It’s like a jigsaw puzzle.
Lots of pieces that fit together.
First I’ll find all the ones with a straight edge.
They must be the rim of the vase.
And this big chunk here has a handle on it, so it must be the side.
And there should be another handle – ah here it is.”
When she had laid out all the pieces in the right order she began to glue them together.
It was hard work.
The glue stuck to her fingers, and she had to wait for the pieces to dry.
It took ages.
At last the vase was finished.
It wasn’t exactly the same as the old one.
This one had a funny lump on one side, and the rim was a bit skew, but Ashley knew Mom would hardly see the difference.
Ashley looked out of the window.
The neighbour, Mrs Du Toit, was watering her vegetables.
Mrs Du Toit was very clever and could make anything.
Ashley ran over to the fence.
“Please, can you lend me one screw and help me fix a shelf?” she asked, and then she told Mrs Du Toit the whole story.
“Of course,” Mrs Du Toit said.
“I’ll come over at once.”
Mom woke up at 9 o’clock.
She was still very sad.
She found Ashley fast asleep on the sofa, and a sheet covering something on the wall.
“What have you been doing all morning, Ashley?” she asked.
“Surprise!” yelled Ashley.
“Happy Mother’s Day.
Your present is behind the sheet.”
Carefully Mom took the sheet off the wall.
There was the blue shelf with the candlesticks, and the photo, and the trophy, and … MOM’S BEST VASE.
Mom clapped her hands.
“You glued it back together!” she exclaimed.
“It’s as good as new.
It’s better than new.
It’s the best present I ever got,” she said, giving Ashley a big hug.
Ben also gave Ashley a hug.
“You’re very clever!” he said.
“You’ve saved Mother’s Day.”
Ashley was so proud.
Mom’s vase wasn’t exactly the same, but it still looked lovely on the new blue shelf.
Eventually,Neocame to a lot of water that rushed through the valley from morning till night.
Neo stepped in to cool his hot legs.
The water splashed at his feet and giggled, “I am a river.
I roam from the mountains to the sea.
Come, follow me.
I’ll take you home.”
Neo looked out the window of his room at the grey view of the grey street with all the wet, grey people hurrying through the grey, pouring rain.
He couldn’t go outside, and he had already read all his books to Mbali.
Just then, Gogo came in with her hair all twiggy from the wind outside.
She was holding something.
Neo could see that it was flattish, and square-ish, and very colourful … and it could open up – just like a treasure box!
“This was my favourite book when I was as young as you,” Gogo told Neo.
“It was my door to the big, wide world.”
Then, she opened the book.
On the first page was a picture of a magical place, far away from the grey, grey day.
The veld was green and gold and brown, with a great, big, blue sky above, and a warm, yellow sun, baking down.
Is that real?” Neo gasped.
Gogo smiled.
“Don’t you know?
All stories are real, if you believe in them,” she said.
Then she pointed to the place on the page where a little boy, just about Neo’s size, was walking across the veld.
As Gogo read, Neo closed his eyes and slipped away, over the hills … across the great, brown earth … off into the big, wide world.
He heard the voices of the veld.
“Come out!
Come out!” sang a little bird.
“It’s a beautiful day!” chirped the cicadas.
“Come away, come and play,” whispered the wind in the long grass.
But in a story, you can do anything.
There was no rainhere.So, Neo set off across the veld.
The first thing he saw was tall and brown with a strong, wooden body.
It had long, brown arms that reached up to the sky, and a big, twiggy head of leafy-green hair that swayed in the warm breeze.
“Hello,” said Neo, his eyes wide.
“What are you?”
“I am a tree.
I can see all the way across the great, gold plains.
Come up, and look with me.” The tree reached out, and Neo climbed up.
From up in the branches, Neo could see to the very edge of the world.
And there was so muchsomewhereout there, that it almost scared him to think of it.
But the tree held him safe, and whispered, “Go and explore.
Don’t be afraid.
It’s a wonderful, big, wide world out there.”
So, Neo climbed down and went on his way across the veld.
Soon, he came across a mound of hard sand with little holes, like tiny doorways.
He could hear a million busy voices inside, and the patter of six million tiny feet running about.
“Hello!
Who are you?” Neo called into one of the doorways.
“Hello!” a tiny voice answered.
“We are ants.
We tell the stories of the world in here.
Do you want to hear some?”
Neo loved stories, so he sat down and listened.
The ants told their stories of the veld and the forest, and of the mountains and the cities beyond.
“So many stories?” Neo asked.
“There are as many stories as there are stars in the sky,” the ants answered.
Neo thought how good that would be.
So, he followed the river across the valley and between the mountains.
Together, they wandered through the afternoon and almost into night, until at last, Neo reached a hilltop.
From there, he could see a little town, washed clean by the rains and gleaming in the light of the setting sun.
Then the river gurgled gently, “Go on, go home.
There are people who love you there, waiting to share stories with you.”
Neo went down, through the town.
He saw the busy streets that rushed through the town, just like rivers.
He saw houses, warm in the evening light.
Inside them, people were busy, just like tiny ants.
At last, Neo peered through a window where an old gogo, with strong arms and twiggy hair like the branches of a big tree, closed a book and bent to kiss her little boy goodnight.
Neo thought about the veld and the tree and the ants and the river.
And as he watched the gogo, a rainbow lit up the little house in colours so bright it looked like a picture in a storybook.
Neo thought of his great adventure inside the pages of Gogo’s favourite storybook, and he thought of her and Mbali and home.
So, Neo slipped through the book, into his warm bed, in his cosy room, in his little house.
And that is why, whenever the world seems too grey, and his room seems too small, Neo opens a book.
Neo thought of his great adventure inside the pages of Gogo’s favourite storybook, and he thought of her and Mbali and home.
Get creative!
Together imagine and recreate a scene from the story using items in your environment.
He steps through a door between the pages, and goes off into the big, wide world.
Nomsa was watching her big sister, Mandisa, make a necklace.
Their mother called from the kitchen, “Mandisa, please go to the shop for me.
Here is the shopping list.” Mandisa read the shopping list, “Bread, margarine, peanut butter, apricot jam, flour, eggs, sugar, milk, tea, and salt.
I’ll need two bags for all this.” Nomsa hopped up and down.
“Can I come too?
Please, can I come?” She had some money saved.
She loved the big round orange sweets at the shop.
“Do you have to?” Mandisa sighed.
She was twelve and Nomsa was six and
sometimes she got tired of her little sister tagging along behind her.
“You’ll have to help me carry the shopping then.”
“I will, I will!” promised Nomsa.
“Read the list again, I want to hear what we have to get.”
“Bread, margarine, peanut butter, apricot jam, flour, eggs, sugar, milk, tea, and salt,” read Mandisa as Nomsa counted the items on her fingers.
Ten items, one for each finger.
Nomsa could not read yet, but she was good at remembering things.
The sisters went out into the street.
The wind was blowing!
It flapped their clothes and it sent the litter in the street racing and tumbling around their feet.
As they passed the hair salon in Mrs Ngubane’s garage they saw Fezeka and Phumla having their hair braided.
Mrs. Ngubane was very clever at braiding.
Fezeka and Phumla were Mandisa’s best friends.
“Yoh, you look good!” Mandisa said when she went into the hair salon to look at the new style in braiding.
It was very smart.
“You’re wearing a new shirt,” Mandisa said to Fezeka.
She bent over and felt the material between her fingers.
“Where did you find this?”
Nomsa sighed.
She wanted to get to the shop quickly.
But all Mandisa thought about these days was clothes and hair and shoes.
“I love your new necklace, Phumla!” said Mandisa bending over to touch her friend’s new necklace.
Then, oh-oh!
The wind snatched the shopping list out of Mandisa’s hand!
It flew away over the wall, then over the roof next door.
It was gone, gone, gone!
Absolutely and completely gone!
“Now I’m in trouble,” said Mandisa as she put her hand over her mouth.
“I’ll have to go home and ask Mama for a new list and she’ll be cross!”
“You don’t have to!
I can remember the shopping list,” said Nomsa hopping up and down.
“I can remember everything.”
She held up her hands and counted the items on her ten fingers.
Each finger was something from the shopping list.
“Bread, margarine, peanut butter, apricot jam, flour, eggs, sugar, milk, tea, and salt!” she said.
Mandisa looked surprised.
“Well done, Sisi!
I’m glad you came with me.
Let’s get to the shop quickly and buy those things.
Otherwise, Mama is going to be cross.”When they got to Mambhele Cash Store,
Mandisa asked for all the things that Nomsa had remembered on her ten fingers and she put the things in the shopping bags.
Nomsa stared at the big bottle of orange sweets and the bottle of jelly babies near the till.
She took her money out and gave it to Mandisa.
She pointed at the sweets she wanted and Mandisa bought them.
Mandisa added a red lollipop as well.
“That’s for saving me from getting into trouble,” said Mandisa.
“I know you like red lollipops.”
They each carried a shopping bag home and Nomsa sucked her red lollipop.
At home, they unpacked the shopping bags on the kitchen table and Mandisa asked, “Mama, can I make pancakes for supper tonight?”
She knew Nomsa loved pancakes.
“Yes,” said their mother.
“I have a lot of school work to mark this afternoon.
It would really help me if you made supper.”
Together Nomsa and Mandisa mixed flour, eggs, milk, sugar and a little salt for pancakes.
They let the mixture stand for an hour.
Then they made pancakes and pancakes and more pancakes.
The kitchen smelt so good!
When Papa came home, he went straight to the kitchen.
“My nose is telling me that we are having pancakes for supper!
And I see that my two daughters are the cooks.
What are you going to put inside them?” he asked.
“There’s some mince left over from yesterday.
We can use that,” said Mandisa.
“And there’s also apricot jam.
Apricot jam is my favourite in the whole world!” said Nomsa hopping up and down.
“Mine too,” said Papa and he laughed.
When Mama came into the kitchen, she clapped her hands.
“Well done, my daughters!” she said.
The pancakes were delicious.
“I can remember the ingredients for the recipe,” Nomsa said.
She held up her hand and counted them on her five fingers, “Flour, eggs, milk, sugar and a little salt!”
Her father laughed and patted her shoulder.
“My clever little girl!” he said.
“Maybe I should use my fingers to remember things too!”
There was once a prince named Sugar.
Prince Sugar was named after his love of sweet treats like cakes, biscuits, tarts, doughnuts and puddings.
Prince Sugar was so spoilt that he wouldn’t share any of his sweet treats with the village children.
“Nobody eats my cakes!
Understand, Mary?
That is the law!” said Prince Sugar to the royal baker.
“The cakes, biscuits and tarts all belong to me and me alone.”
One day, a mysterious new baker arrived in the village.
She started handing out slices of cake and biscuits to all the children.
When Prince Sugar heard about this, he became very angry and sent his guards to arrest the baker and bring her to him.
“How dare you enter my village and start giving out treats to the children.
It is against the law!” shouted Prince Sugar angrily.
“Your Highness, I apologise sincerely.
Please allow me to fix my mistake by baking for you alone,” replied the baker, whose name was Awande.
“I will bake you a new treat every day.
These treats I bake are very special.
You have to eat the whole treat within a day.”
“Of course, I’ll be able to finish a treat every day!” said the Prince greedily.
“Very well,” replied Awande with a smile.
So, every morning, Prince Sugar received a freshly baked treat, which he gobbled up.
As the days passed, the treats seemed to be tastier and bigger.
Prince Sugar was very happy, and he finished all these delicious cakes, biscuits and tarts without sharing even a tiny piece with the village children.
But as the treats grew bigger and bigger, Prince Sugar found that he could no longer finish them.
He had to store them in a secret part of the palace so that Awande wouldn’t know that he wasn’t finishing a treat every day.
After a few weeks, Prince Sugar had had to store so many treats that no more would fit into the secret place.
So, he called his servants and Mary, the royal baker, and ordered them to throw away some of the treats.
“Make sure that Awande doesn’t see you doing this,” he commanded.
So, the next morning Mary and the servants carried the leftover treats deep into the forest behind the palace.
But a mysterious thing happened: that night, while everyone slept, all the treats that had been thrown in the forest reappeared in the palace!
The next morning, Awande, the baker, arrived with a fresh sweet treat and demanded to see Prince Sugar.
“Did you think I would not know if you threw my treats away?
Did you not agree to eat the whole treat that I sent by the end of the same day?
I warned you in the beginning that my treats were special and that you would have to finish each one,” said Awande angrily.
Prince Sugar started to feel a little afraid and his stomach felt a little sick, but he ate and ate until he had finished the leftover treats plus the one that Awande had brought that day.
“I no longer enjoy the treats,” said Prince Sugar the next morning when Awande arrived with the treat of the day.
“A promise is a promise, your Highness,” said Awande.
The prince looked sad.
“What can I do to stop you from baking treats for me every day?” asked Prince Sugar.
“You are called Prince Sugar because you love sweet things.
Yet, because of your laws, other children don’t know sweetness,” replied Awande.
“So, you must eat and eat the treats, until the children’s mouths are sweet.” With that, the baker turned around and walked out of the palace, leaving a big, tasty cake for Prince Sugar to eat.
Prince Sugar thought and thought about what Awande had said but he did not understand.
How could the children’s mouths be sweet if he was the only one eating Awande’s treats?
So, the prince went for a walk in the garden where it was quiet.
He had to think of a way to stop Awande from bringing sweet treats to him every day.
As he was walking along, a soccer ball flew over the high garden wall and landed in in the bushes.
Next a scruffy little boy appeared over the wall to fetch the ball.
When he saw Prince Sugar, he nearly fell over with fright.
I just came to get the ball back,” said the terrified boy.
Prince Sugar was so busy thinking of a plan to stop getting sweet treats that he forgot to be angry.
“Before you fetch your ball,” he said, “please tell me what would make your mouth sweet.”
“Things made with sugar, your Highness,” said the little boy shyly.
“Cakes and doughnuts and biscuits – all the things we are not allowed to eat.”
The little boy looked so sad when he said this that Prince Sugar suddenly felt ashamed.
For the first time, he saw how selfish he had been.
He had so many treats that he no longer enjoyed them, but the village children had not tasted anything sweet for a very, very long time.
The prince hurried back into the palace and sent for Awande.
“Awande,” he said, “I’ve been selfish and silly.
I would like to have a party for the people of the village.
Please bake your treats for the children and their parents too.
From today, everyone may eat sweet things if they wish to.”
Awande smiled.
“With pleasure, your Highness!” she said, and she baked the fanciest and most delicious cakes, biscuits and tarts that the village people had even seen or tasted.
And they ate and ate until they were satisfied.
The following morning, Awande, the baker, had disappeared without a trace.
“With pleasure, your Highness!” she said, and she baked the fanciest and most delicious cakes, biscuits and tarts that the village people had even seen or tasted.
Lank, lank gelede in ’n dorpie ver hiervandaan het daar ’n pragtige meisie met die naam Sefako gewoon.
Sefako het al die mans in die dorpie se harte gesteel.
Hulle het gedigte en liedjies oor haar skoonheid geskryf.
Maar Sefako het nie belanggestel om met enige van hulle te trou nie, en dit het haar pa kwaad gemaak, want hy het gedink dit is tyd dat sy dogter trou.
Wat Sefako nie geweet het nie, is dat sy ’n ongewone geheime bewonderaar het!
En hierdie geheime bewonderaar is die krokodil wat by die rivier bly waar sy gaan water haal.
Elke dag stap Sefako ’n paar uur voor die son ondergaan met haar kleipot rivier toe om vir aandete te gaan water haal.
Sefako het die gewoonte om ’n rukkie onder haar gunstelingboom te dut nadat sy water uit die rivier gaan haal het.
Die krokodil kruip dikwels in die water weg en kyk na haar terwyl sy slaap.
Hy wil so graag met haar praat, maar hy weet glad nie hoe hy haar aandag kan trek sonder om haar bang te maak nie.
Op ’n dag skraap die krokodil die moed bymekaar en kom nader aan Sefako nadat sy aan die slaap geraak het.
Die verliefde krokodil is so bly om naby Sefako te wees dat hy oor sy liefde vir haar begin sing.
Sefako hoor die wonderskone liedjie, draai in haar slaap om en dink dat sy seker droom.
Die krokodil wil nie hê Sefako moet hom sien wanneer sy wakker word nie en daarom gly hy vinnig terug in die rivier in.
Die volgende dag gebeur dit weer … en die dag daarna … en die dag daarna.
Sefako hoor in haar slaap hoe die krokodil vir haar sing, maar wanneer sy wakker word, is daar niemand nie.
Sy hoor net die sagte geritsel van die blare en die beeste wat doer anderkant bulk.
Die sang roer haar hartsnare, en Sefako dink al hoe meer aan hoe graag sy die sanger wil sien.
Sefako begin toe tussen die riete, bome en gras na die raaiselagtige stem soek, maar sy vind niemand nie.
Eendag besluit Sefako dat sy nie langer na die raaiselagtige sanger gaan soek nie.
Sy beplan eerder om die een aan wie die pragtige stem behoort, te vang!
Sefako gaan haal soos gewoonlik water by die rivier en gaan lê onder haar gunstelingboom en maak of sy slaap.
Soos gewoonlik kruip die verliefde krokodil uit die rivier en begin vir haar sing.
Toe Sefako die pragtige stem hoor, maak sy haar oë vinnig oop en sien dat sy in die oë staar van … ’N KROKODIL!
Sefako is baie bang!
Sy skop haar kleipot om toe sy vinnig opspring, en al die water mors op die grond uit.
Toe begin sy teen die rivierwal op hardloop, maar ongelukkig struikel sy oor ’n rots en val met ’n harde slag op die grond neer.
Die verliefde krokodil, wat haar gevolg het, staan daar naby en kyk na haar.
Toe hy nader kom, verstar Sefako van vrees.
“Moenie bang wees nie,” sê die krokodil saggies.
“Ek kyk al baie dae lank hoe jy onder daardie boom lê en slaap en ek het jou nog nie seergemaak nie.
Hoekom sal ek jou nou wil opeet?” Toe sing die krokodil ’n strelende lied wat Sefako se hart onmiddellik laat smelt.
Noudat sy nie meer bang is nie, sit die beeldskone meisie regop en luister na die stem wat sy begin liefkry.
Daarna gaan Sefako elke aand rivier toe om die singende krokodil te ontmoet, en ná ’n rukkie besluit sy dat sy met hom wil trou.
Uiteindelik skraap sy die moed bymekaar om vir haar pa te vertel.
Sefako se pa is glad nie ingenome hiermee nie!
“Het hierdie krokodil van jou enige beeste om jou bruidskat te betaal?” vra hy briesend.
“Sal hy vir jou kinders kan gee en vir jou ’n huis kan bou?”
Al wil Sefako se pa nie hê dat sy met die krokodil moet trou nie, verander haar gevoelens nie.
Toe haar pa besef sy dogter gaan nie van plan verander nie, sluit hy haar in een van die hutte in die dorp toe.
Hy bring elke dag vir haar middagete en kyk hoe dit met haar gaan.
Maar op ’n dag vergeet Sefako se pa om die hut se deur te sluit.
Sefako wag ’n rukkie om seker te maak dat dit veilig is voor sy die deur oopmaak en vinnig rivier toe hardloop.
Toe sy daar aankom, roep Sefako: “Krokodil, Krokodil, dis ek, Sefako!” Die krokodil, wat al dae lank desperaat na haar soek, kom van onder die water te voorskyn om haar te groet.
Die volgende dag ontdek Sefako se pa dat sy weg is, en hy is woedend!
Blind van woede gryp hy ’n dik stok en volg sy dogter se voetspore tot by die rivier.
Hy is vasbeslote om te keer dat sy dogter met die krokodil trou.
Toe hy by die rivieroewer aankom, sien hy Sefako in die rivier swem, met die krokodil langs haar.
“Sefako, Sefako,” roep hy.
“Kom onmiddellik terug!
Jy mag nie met daardie krokodil trou nie.”
Sefako kyk om en wuif vir haar pa voordat sy saam met die krokodil wegswem.
Die besorgde pa kyk hulpeloos toe terwyl sy dogter en die krokodil onder die water verdwyn.
’n Ruk later keer Sefako na die dorpie terug om te kom kuier.
Haar pa is oorstelp van vreugde om haar te sien.
Hy het baie na haar verlang, en op daardie oomblik weet hy wat hy moet doen.
“Welkom, welkom, albei van julle,” sê hy en hardloop om Sefako en die krokodil te groet.
En dan draai hy na die krokodil en sê: “Welkom in ons familie.”
* Sefako raak verlief op ’n krokodil.
Dink jy dit is moontlik om vir ’n krokodil lief te wees?
Hoekom of hoekom nie?
* As jy enige dier as ’n maat kon hê, watter dier sou jy kies, en hoekom?

Every day when eight-year-old Sisanda gets home from school, she changes out of her uniform, eats her lunch and plays a game ofumlabalabawith her grandfather.
They have so much fun flying their “cows” around the board that she doesn’t want to stop.
But then he reminds her that she wants to become a bank manager one day when she grows up.
“How will you do that if you don’t go to high school?” jokes her grandfather.
Sisanda just laughs.
“Iwillgo to high school and university too.
That’s why I work so hard at school!”
Sisanda is quite tall for her age − she takes after her father.
Her round face and beautiful smile are her mother’s.
Both her parents get up early each morning to go to work at the game reserve close by.
By the time Sisanda and her friends start school, coachloads of tourists are already arriving to spot Africa’s finest animals.
For her last birthday, Sisanda had a special treat – her parents got permission for her to have a party at the game reserve.
The giraffes at the reserve were curious about this group of people.
They stretched out their long necks for the best view of the party and they even seemed to want some of the birthday cake!
Sisanda loved the giraffes.
All animals were special to her, but it was the quiet and gentle giraffes that stole her heart.
She could spend all day watching them.
One Friday, Sisanda’s father came home from work early.
He looked very upset.
“What’s wrong, Baba?” Sisanda asked.
“Today a swarm of bees stung a mother giraffe,” explained Sisanda’s father.
“Her head was so swollen from all the stings that her beautiful eyes were closed.
We tried everything to help her, but it was no use – she died.
And the saddest part of all is that she had a young calf that still needs her.”
“Oh no!” said Sisanda starting to cry.
“I wish there was something I could do.
The baby giraffe must be crying just like me.”
Sisanda cried and cried.
Her mother tried to comfort her.
She even read Sisanda an extra story at bedtime to help her forget how sorry she felt for that baby giraffe.
Eventually, Sisanda drifted off to sleep to the sound of her mama’s voice.
The next morning Sisanda woke up with an idea!
“Can I go to work with you today?” she asked her baba.
“I have a gift for the baby giraffe.”
Her parents looked at each other, smiled and said, “Yes, of course you can come with us.”
It was a warm but cloudy day.
Everything in the reserve seemed unusually quiet.
“I think the sun isn’t shining today because it’s sad about the baby giraffe,” said Sisanda.
A great big elephant gazed at the family walking by.
“Maybe he’s wondering why a little girl is going to work with her parents,” said Sisanda’s mother.
Sisanda nodded.
“He’s going to get a surprise when he finds out,” she thought.
They found the baby giraffe standing alone.
His willowy neck drooped and his big brown eyes looked dull.
Sisanda stood as close to him as she could.
She opened her small bag and took out a book.
Then, to her parents’ surprise, she began to read to the baby giraffe.
He turned his head towards her voice and listened as if he could understand every word.
At first, Sisanda’s parents thought reading to a giraffe was a strange thing to do, but they changed their minds when they saw how peaceful he looked − his gentle eyes looking at Sisanda.
“My story made him feel better,” Sisanda told her grandfather when she got home.
Sisanda went to visit the little giraffe most afternoons and over weekends.
And every time she went, she took another story to share.
The two new friends looked so good together that even passing tourists took photos of them.
Slowly the little giraffe grew stronger.
People at the game reserve were taking really good care of him and all the love from his new friend, Sisanda, worked like magic.
One day the reserve manager asked Sisanda to give her new friend a name.
“I think Thokozani is a good name,” said Sisanda.
The next day the reserve manager phoned Sisanda’s teacher.
He invited all Sisanda’s classmates to come and meet Thokozani.
The handsome giraffe had grown taller and stronger in the three months since Sisanda’s first visit.
On the day of the outing, forty Grade 3 children waited eagerly for the reserve gates to open.
Then Sisanda proudly led everyone to Thokozani.
Some of the children looked at the tall giraffe in amazement.
Others giggled nervously.
Their teacher, Miss Khanyile, just smiled.
“Your friend is beautiful, Sisanda.
You have been so kind to him,” she said gently.
“What is his name?” asked one of the boys.
“Thokozani,” answered Sisanda.
“Thokozani means ‘rejoice’,” explained Miss Khanyile.
The children sat down and listened while Sisanda read the story she had read to Thokozani on the day they had first met.
The reserve manager took photos.
Some tourists passing by took photos too.
Even a photographer from a local newspaper clicked away.
He promised that a photo of them would be in the local newspaper very soon.
Everyone cheered.
What a gift!
Everyone cheered.
It was a rainy day and Josh was sitting at the kitchen table making a kite.
He had some light strips of wood which he used to make the frame of the kite.
He also had some blue and red and green and pink tissue paper.
He covered the whole kite with blue tissue paper.
“This blue paper is the kite’s face!” decided Josh.
He cut out red tissue paper to make happy smiling lips, green tissue paper for eyes, and pink tissue paper circles for cheeks.
Then he made a long kite tail out of the blue, red, green and pink paper.
“Your tail looks like the clothes dancing in the wind on Gogo’s washing line,” said Josh to the kite.
Then he wound a very long piece of string around a cardboard tube and tied the other end of the string to the frame of the kite, so that it wouldn’t fly away from him later when it was in the air.
“Your name is Skycatcher!” said Josh to the kite.
The next morning, Josh sat in his wheelchair outside his front door with Skycatcher in his lap.
It was the right sort of day to fly a kite.
He was waiting for Hope.
She was going to push him along the pavement as fast as she could go, so that Skycatcher could catch the wind and fly.
Where was she?
“Here I am!” said Hope.
“I’m sorry I’m a bit late.
Is your kite ready to fly?”
“Yes, I can’t wait to get it up into the sky!” said Josh.
“Let’s go then!” said Hope as she held the handles at the back of the wheelchair tightly.
She started to walk fast, and then to run all the way along the pavement.
The wheels went bumpity-bump, bumpity-bump, picking up speed as Hope ran.
Josh let a little bit of the string unwind from the cardboard tube he was holding.
Suddenly the kite took off!
It fluttered about in the air just above their heads.
Josh and Hope raced past Neo who was in his front garden playing with Bella.
He was wearing a newspaper pirate hat and he had a cardboard sword.
Bella was wearing a witch’s hat.
“You’re not a very good pirate!” said Bella, waving her magic wand.
“Woof!
Woof!” barked Noodle, but Neo wasn’t listening to him or Bella.
Neo was watching Josh and Hope coming along the pavement at full speed.
Then Bella forgot about their game too and she also watched Josh and Hope!
“Can we come with you?” asked Neo.
“Yes, come!
We’re going to fly Skycatcher!” said Josh as he went past.
“Come on, Noodle,” said Bella.
“Come on, Noodle,” said Bella.
“Woof!
“Come on, Noodle,” said Bella.
So Hope and Neo and Bella and Noodle ran in a long line behind Josh, going bumpity-bump and woof!
“Woof!
all the way along the pavement.
When they got to the field next to some houses, Josh let out some more string and Skycatcher flew higher up into the air.
And then higher.
It glided gently over the rooftops and treetops with the blue sky around it.
Josh and Hope and Neo and Bella watched the kite and wished they were flying up in the sky with it.
“Woof!
Woof!” Noodle barked loudly.
He was also looking up at the kite.
“Neo, do you want to try flying the kite?” asked Josh.
“Yes please!” said Neo, and he took the cardboard tube of string from Josh.
But it was windy so Skycatcher pulled hard, and Neo dropped the cardboard tube.
It whizzed round and round on the ground like a live, wild thing and it let more and more string out, so that the kite flew higher and higher.
Soon it was just a small speck in the sky.
But it was windy so Skycatcher pulled hard, and Neo dropped the cardboard tube.
He held it in his jaws and under his paws so that it couldn’t spin around.
Then he jumped up with his paws on Josh’s knees and passed the tube to Josh.
Finally, Skycatcher stopped flying away and stayed where it was, with its bright tail waving about in the sky below it.
“Noodle, you saved our kite!” said Josh.
Noodle wagged his tail.
“Noodle, you’re such a clever dog!” said Bella.
Noodle wagged his tail.
“Noodle, you’re such a clever dog!” said Bella.
Noodle wagged his tail.
Tighter and tighter he wound the string around the cardboard roll until Skycatcher lay still in his lap after its great adventure in the sky.
Hope turned the wheelchair around, and they all went bumpity-bump and woof!
woof!
all the way home.
When Josh lay in bed that night, he thought about what fun he had had with his kite and how he had nearly lost it.
“Luckily I have the best friends in the world!” he sighed as he closed his eyes.
Get creative!
* Let your children design their own kites.
Ask them questions to help them get started – for example: What shape will you make your kite?
What materials could you use to make it?
How could you decorate it?
* Have fun with your children by blowing up balloons and then letting them go.
(Don’t tie a knot at the end of the blown-up balloon.)
Watch how they fly all over the place as the air escapes!
* In the story, Neo wears a hat made of newspaper.
* Have fun with your children by blowing up balloons and then letting them go.
The snails who lived in Mrs Mondliwa’s garden were very unhappy.
“I’VE HAD IT!” grumbled Slimy Snail.
“Me too,” agreed Speedy, his best friend.
“Why can’t we snails be liked more by the other garden bugs?”
“I’m fed up with all of this bad treatment,” continued Slimy.
“Yeah, what’s wrong with us?” asked Speedy.
Let’s get all the snails together and complain to the other bugs,” suggested Slimy.
“That’s a great idea,” agreed Speedy.
“We’ll tell them that they have to like us more.”
The next day, Speedy and Slimy and all the other snails met under the thorn bush to chat to the other garden bugs.
“We snails want to be shown some respect,” said Speedy.
“We also want all of you to like us more.”
“NO WAY!” shouted Butterfly.
“Snails are awful.”
“YES!” agreed Bee.
“Snails must buzz off.”
“You’re a nuisance,” added Caterpillar.
“But what have we ever done wrong?” asked Slimy.
“You’re a nuisance,” added Caterpillar.
“WHAT!
Just look at this bruise on my leg,” began Grasshopper.
Just look at this bruise on my leg,” began Grasshopper.
“Do you know how I got it?
You snails slither your slime all over the place causing us to slip and hurt ourselves.
“We’re so small, we get stuck in your slime,” added Queen Ant.
Do you have any idea how slippery that stuff is?”
“Oh dear!” said the snails surprised.
“Oh dear!” said the snails surprised.
“Oh dear!” said the snails surprised.
“And that’s not all,” Caterpillar said.
“Do you know what traffic jams you cause?
You snails are sooooo slow.”
You snails are sooooo slow.”
The snails felt awful.
The snails felt awful.
The little snails felt so bad that they began to cry.
The snails felt awful.
They had no idea they were causing so many problems.
The other bugs were silent.
The other bugs were silent.
Sorry, but you snails are just awful.
They thought and thought about what might be good about snails.
Eventually, Butterfly said, “NOPE!
“In fact, we think all the snails should leave the garden.
The rest of us have had enough!” added Worm, even though he was quite slimy himself.
The rest of us have had enough!” added Worm, even though he was quite slimy himself.
“SNAILS OUT!
“Wait, wait,” said Slimy.
“Give us a chance.”
“Give us a chance and we’ll prove that snails can do some good.”
“Yes,” said Speedy.
“Give us a chance and we’ll prove that snails can do some good.”
“Give us a chance and we’ll prove that snails can do some good.”
“You have two days to prove to us that you are useful, or else, goodbye!”
“Very well then,” they agreed.
“You have two days to prove to us that you are useful, or else, goodbye!”
“Come on, snails, let’s get fit!” The snails spent the whole day training, but unfortunately, they found running impossible.
“Come on, snails, let’s get fit!” The snails spent the whole day training, but unfortunately, they found running impossible.
“Oh no!” said the oldest snail.
“Now what?
We have to come up with an idea that will make the other bugs like us.”
“I’ve got it!” said Slimy.
“Let’s try eating weeds instead of flowers.”
“Okay, why not?” agreed the others.
So, the snails tried to eat only the weeds in the garden.
“Oh no, this is not going to work.
Weeds taste TERRIBLE!” said Speedy after a little while.
The snails felt very sad.
Some even started to pack up their homes to leave.
“Hey, I’ve got an idea,” giggled Simphiwe, the youngest snail.
“I need you all to meet me at the top of the anthill.”
“Are you crazy?
It’ll take us all day to climb up there,” said Slimy.
“Trust me,” said Simphiwe.
Two days passed and the snails finally made it to the top of the anthill.
The other bugs gathered at the foot of the anthill to see what the snails were up to.
“So, what’s your great idea?” they demanded.
“Well, um …” said Simphiwe.
“Yes?” said the other bugs.
“You’ll definitely let us stay when you see what we’ve made,” said Simphiwe.
The other bugs stood completely still, their eyes glued to Simphiwe.
“Ta-da,” said Simphiwe moving towards the slope of the anthill.
“We’ve made you the most wonderful SLIPPERY SLIDE from all of our snail slime!”
There was a long pause as the bugs all thought about this idea.
“COOOOOL!” they agreed.
“Let’s try it out.”
And they did.
The bugs all took it in turn to slide down the gooey slippery slide.
It was loads of fun.
Everyone loved the slide and so it was decided that the snails could definitely stay in the garden!
It was a nice, lazy day along the river.
Everything was very quiet.
The only noise was Little Bird chirping softly while he cleaned Hippo’s big, flat teeth.
Hippo was enjoying getting his teeth cleaned.
He lay with his head out of the water, his mouth wide open.
The sun warmed him and before he knew it, he was drifting off to sleep.
He dreamt of a big juicy patch of grass floating right by him and, in his dream, he took a big bite and swallowed.
“You ate Little Bird!” The voice woke Hippo up with a fright.
It was one of the flamingos.
He looked very angry!
His pink face was turning red!
“You ate Little Bird,” he shouted again, pointing his wing at Hippo.
“I would never!” Hippo defended himself.
“I eat grass, not little birds!
Besides, Little Bird is my friend!
I wouldn’t eat him!”
“I saw you!
He was cleaning your teeth, and you swallowed him up!”
Hippo remembered his dream.
Now he was scared!
Then, as he climbed out of the river, he heard a familiar chirping sound.
It was Little Bird!
Hippo looked all around to see where Little Bird was.
At last, he realised that the sound was coming from inside his tummy.
He had swallowed his friend!
“See?
“You ate Little Bird!”
I didn’t mean to ...” Hippo cried, “We need to rescue him.
We have to get him out of my tummy!”
We have to get him out of my tummy!”
By now all the animals living along the river had come closer to find out what was going on.
They started coming up with plans.
“Let’s send some small fish down into your tummy.
They can lead the way for Little Bird to swim back out,” said Monkey.
But hearing this, all the small fish quickly swam away.
“We can use one of my teeth to cut your stomach open and save Little Bird,” suggested Lion.
Hippo didn’t think that sounded like a good idea!
“What are we going to do?
Little Bird can’t stay in my tummy forever!” said Hippo.
But he just couldn’t think of any better ideas.
Perhaps he should let Lion cut open his tummy and take out Little Bird.
He was just about to agree to it when wise old Owl came to the rescue.
“Calm down, everyone,” said Owl.
Everyone listened.
“Get me a big feather,” he ordered.
Quickly, one of the birds flew down to where Flamingo stood and brought back what Owl had asked for.
“Wonderful!” said Owl as he flew down to the ground in front of Hippo.
“Now open your mouth as wide as you can, and I am going to climb inside!” he said.
“Don’t do that!
He is going to eat you too!” Monkey warned.
“Wonderful!” said Owl as he flew down to the ground in front of Hippo.
“Oh, be quiet!” Owl told them.
Whatever you do, do not close your mouth while I am in there!”
Owl climbed inside Hippo’s huge and scary jaws!
Then he began to tickle Hippo’s throat softly with the feather.
At first it only made Hippo giggle, but then suddenly...
“Gha...gha...ghaaaaa!” Hippo coughed, and Owl and Little Bird came flying out of his mouth!
Both of them were dripping with hippo spit.
Little Bird hugged Owl and then rushed to hug Hippo too.
“I am so sorry!” said Hippo.
“Don’t feel bad,” said Little Bird.
“I should have woken you up when you fell asleep.
I know you didn’t mean to.
It was just a mistake, and besides, I am perfectly alright.”
Hippo and Little Bird turned to Owl who was busy washing his wings in the river.
“Thank you, Owl.
You saved the day!” they said.
“Pleasure!” said Owl, washing the last bit of spit out of his feathers.
“Now, if everyone could be quiet, I can go back to sleep.”
Owl flew back to the hollow of a big tree that was his home.
All the other animals went back to their own business.
Flamingo’s face went back to its usual pink colour, but he was still shaking his head.
“Silly bird!
He eats you but you still stay friends,” he muttered.
Then he went back to his spot, stood on one leg and fell asleep.
“I really am sorry,” said Hippo to Little Bird again.
“I understand if you don’t want to clean my teeth again.”
“But then you will get toothache!” answered Little Bird.
“We’ll just make sure that you don’t fall asleep while I’m doing it.
Now let’s go and find you some juicy grass to eat.
I’m sure you must be hungry.”
And off they went.
* Have you ever made a big mistake?
What happened, and how did you feel about it?
* What happened to make you feel better afterwards?
* Little Bird and Hippo were still friends even though Hippo had nearly eaten Little Bird.
Do you think it is important to forgive others if they made a mistake?
What happened, and how did you feel about it?
Once upon a time there was a giraffe and a bat-eared fox who were very good friends.
They were both very good at stealing and spent a lot of time together getting up to no good.
One day Fox was feeling hungry.
“Come, my friend,” he said to Giraffe.
“Let’s cross the river and steal some food from the farm over there.”
“Great idea!” said the giraffe, licking his lips.
“I feel like a tasty watermelon.”
The giraffe and the fox crossed the river.
The fox held tightly to the giraffe’s long neck because he could not swim.
On the other side of the river, the clever fox made a hole in the farmer’s fence with his sharp teeth.
Then the fox and the giraffe squeezed quietly through the fence to steal food on the other side.
The fox stole five eggs from the hen coop and the giraffe chewed through a patch of lettuce.
The giraffe was just starting on a juicy watermelon when the fox lifted his nose to the sky and gave a howl.
“Shhhhh,” hissed the giraffe spitting bits of watermelon all over the fox.
“What do you mean, ‘shhhhh’?” asked the fox wiping his whiskers.
“I always sing when I have finished my food.
It’s my custom.”
“Well, wait for me to finish my watermelon,” crunched the giraffe.
“Otherwise the farmer is going to hear you and come and chase us away.”
The fox was tired of waiting.
He lifted his nose to the sky again and started to sing, “Owoooooooo!”
The farmer was having his lunch when he heard the fox howling.
He ran outside with his big stick.
The fox saw him coming and, being very quick, he dashed through the hole in the fence and was gone before the farmer even saw him.
The poor giraffe, on the other hand, was standing with his front legs wide apart trying to enjoy the last of his watermelon.
When he saw the farmer coming, he tried to stand up and run away, but his legs became tangled and he fell over.
“Never, never steal from me again!” shouted the farmer, beating the giraffe with his stick.
When the giraffe eventually escaped, he was bruised all over his body and furious with the fox.
He limped over to the river where the fox was snoozing under a bush.
“Some friend you are!” shouted the giraffe, waking the fox.
“Thanks to your singing I have been beaten black and blue.”
“Don’t be angry,” said the fox.
“I told you I always sing once I have finished my food.
Now let’s cross the river and go back home.”
The fox held onto the giraffe’s neck and the giraffe swam out into the river.
When the giraffe reached the deepest part of the river, he said to the fox, “I am going to take a bath now.
I feel all hot and bothered after that beating.”
“You can’t!” said the fox, staring at the giraffe with bulging eyes.
“If you go under the water, I will drown!
I cannot swim!”
“But I must bath,” said the giraffe.
“It’s my custom.” With that, the giraffe ducked under the water.
The fox sputtered and thrashed his paws.
“Help!
Help!
I’m drowning!” the fox cried.
The giraffe was cross about his beating, but he felt terrible watching the fox splash around in the water.
The fox was his friend after all.
The giraffe put his head under the water and used it to lift the fox back onto his neck.
The fox coughed and choked and held on to the giraffe for dear life.
When they reached the other side of the river, the fox thought about what he had done to his friend.
“Giraffe?” he said quietly.
“Yes, Fox,” answered the giraffe.
“I’m sorry for treating you badly.
I see that what you did to me was because of the bad way that I treated you earlier,” said Fox.
Giraffe nodded.
“It was,” he said.
“I was paying you back for what you did to me.”
“Sorry,” said the fox.
So, the fox and the giraffe had learnt that it is important to treat others the way we want to be treated, and from that day on, they always did so.
And, to this day, they are still the best of friends.
Get creative!
After you have read The giraffe and the fox, talk to your children about how they like to be treated by their friends and then use their suggestions to write a list together called, 10 ways to be a good friend.
Lesedi loved the stars.
While other children couldn’t wait for it to be morning, she couldn’t wait for night-time.
She wasn’t scared of the dark at all.
She loved to go outside before bedtime just to look up at the night sky.
Now, imagine all the stars she saw.
Hundreds and hundreds of bright, twinkling stars and the big, round, yellow moon.
“It’s almost bedtime, Lesedi!” called the little girl’s mother.
“Coming, Mama!” Lesedi called back.
But Lesedi wasn’t ready to go inside.
She wanted to count the stars.
“One, two, three, four …” Lesedi had counted up to one hundred and thirty-three when she heard her mother call again.
As she turned to go indoors, she noticed a huge, bright light in the sky.
It was coming closer and closer.
It was a giant spaceship!
Lesedi did not take her eyes off it and watched as it landed right there in her front garden.
Lesedi walked over to the spaceship and touched it.
It was smooth and shiny and felt warm.
A big door on the side suddenly opened and a ramp lowered to the ground.
“Maybe I can just have a quick look inside,” thought Lesedi.
Slowly, she walked up the ramp.
There were bright lights and red and blue buttons everywhere.
But it was the giant orange button just below one of the windows that grabbed her attention.
“I wonder what will happen if I press that?” she said aloud.
BEEPwent the button as she pressed it.
Then the door slammed closed and a there was a loudBOOMas the engine started up.
Next, she heard a voice over a speaker say, “Spaceship launching in 3, 2, 1…”
Lesedi felt the spaceship move!
It shook from left to right; it shook up and down, and then it lifted off with a bang.
“Mama is going to be so cross,” thought Lesedi, but she had a big smile on her face.
She was finally going to space!
Through the spaceship windows, she could see her house getting smaller and smaller as they flew upwards.
She waved and said, “Bye-bye, Mama!
I won’t be long!”
Up, up, up went the spaceship.
It weaved in and around the stars.
It looped round and round the planets and soared further and further into space.
“Wait until I tell Tshepo and Amina about this at school,” she thought.
Lesedi was still looking out of the window when she saw something up ahead.
Yes, it was!
Could it be…?
Yes, it was!
It was the moon … and there was a man standing on it.
He seemed to be waving at her.
“It’s the man on the moon!” shrieked Lesedi with excitement.
The man kept waving until the spaceship landed on the moon with a soft thump.
The man kept waving until the spaceship landed on the moon with a soft thump.
“Hello,” he said through the glass.
“I don’t get many visitors.
What’s your name?”
“I’m Lesedi,” she said proudly.
“I’m not supposed to be here.
This isn’t my spaceship.
It landed in our garden, so I got in and then it took off!”
“That must be because you are a born explorer,” said the man.
“I am.
I love space and I especially love stars.
In fact, my name, Lesedi, means light,” she said.
“That’s wonderful!
Here’s something to take home with you.” Lesedi opened the window and held out her hand.
The man gave her a small rock.
“It’s a special moon rock.
Now you have something that will help you always to remember your adventure.”
“Thank you so much, Man on the moon!”
Even though Lesedi was enjoying her adventure, she was starting to feel a bit tired.
“Goodness!
Mama is going to be worried about me!” she thought, yawning.
She looked around.
“Maybe if I press that orange button again, the spaceship will take me back home.”
So she pressed it.
Immediately, a voice came through the speaker again, saying, “Return journey beginning in 3,2,1…”
“Goodbye, Man on the moon,” called Lesedi quickly.
“Goodbye, Lesedi.
I hope I see you again,” he said, waving to her.
The spaceship lifted off the moon and slowly turned around.
Lesedi could see Planet Earth far below.
It looked like the blue bouncing ball she and her friends loved to play with.
Then she felt the spaceship whoosh down, down, down, until it landed in her garden with a bump.
The door opened, and the ramp came down.
“I’m home!” shouted Lesedi.
She ran down the ramp and looked up at the big, round, yellow moon, and thought that she saw a tiny man waving.
When Lesedi’s mother came outside looking for her, she found her daughter lying fast asleep on the grass.
“Oh my little girl, you must have been so tired,” she said picking her up.
She carried Lesedi inside and tucked her into bed.
Then she felt something in Lesedi’s hand.
“Funny little girl,” she smiled, kissing Lesedi’s forehead.
Then she switched off the light and left the room, not noticing that the round, grey stone was glowing in the dark.
Long ago, in the peaceful village of Mudavula, there lived a very lazy chameleon.
At that time, all the animals farmed the land to feed themselves and their families.
All except Chameleon.
All except Chameleon.
Because of his laziness, he did not want to work like everyone else.
Instead, he thought up a crooked plan so that he could borrow from others and live well.
One Monday morning, Chameleon went to Hare to borrow maize meal.
Before he arrived at Hare’s house, he changed his skin colour from brown to green.
“Please lend me some maize meal,” Chameleon asked.
“And when will you pay me back?” Hare asked.
“At the end of the month!” Chameleon promised.
Hare filled the empty bucket that Chameleon had brought.
Chameleon took the maize meal home, smiling as he went.
He was thinking about his crooked plan to trick the other animals.
He made up a little song to help him remember his plan.
‘I will change my colours
But no one will ever know.
I was green when Hare saw me,
Frog will see a black chameleon
Frog will see a black chameleon
Frog will see a black chameleon
I will change and change my colours.
They will never know it’s me!’
On Tuesday, Chameleon woke up hungry.
“I can’t eat porridge every day.
I need rice!” Chameleon thought.
“I will change my skin colour to yellow and go to Lizard.
If I can trick everyone, I will not pay anyone anything!”
Chameleon went with his empty bucket to Lizard, who kindly filled it with rice.
Chameleon promised to pay Lizard back at the end of the month.
On Wednesday, after cooking some rice, Chameleon looked unhappily at his plate.
No!
No!
Plain rice is not nice.
“Frog will give me meat!” he decided.
Chameleon changed his skin colour to black and ran to Frog’s house with his empty bucket.
Frog filled his bucket with meat.
Again, Chameleon promised to pay Frog back at the end of the month.
“I am missing fruit.
I need it!” Chameleon thought on Thursday.
“Who has fruit?” Chameleon thought, scratching his head.
“Tortoise!
Yes, Tortoise!”
Chameleon changed his skin colour to brown and went to Tortoise with his empty bucket.
He asked Tortoise for fruit, and Tortoise filled his bucket with bananas, oranges and apples.
“Thank you, thank you, Mr Tortoise.
I will pay you back at the end of the month,” he promised.
All the time Chameleon kept singing his song so that he would remember his colour tricks.
‘I will change my colours
But no one will ever know.
I was green when Hare saw me,
‘I will change my colours
Frog will see a black chameleon
Frog will see a black chameleon
I will change and change my colours.
They will never know it’s me!’
When the end of the month came, the animals waited for Chameleon to come and pay them back what he had borrowed.
But Chameleon did not come.
First, Hare went to Chameleon’s house.
“Those of here!
Those of here!” Hare called loudly at the gate.
Chameleon peeped through the window.
When he saw Hare, he remembered his song.
“Aah, Mr Hare, I was green when I borrowed your maize meal,” Chameleon said to himself.
Quickly, he changed his skin colour to yellow and went to the gate to meet Hare.
“I am looking for a green chameleon,” Hare said surprised.
“A green chameleon?
I moved in not long ago,” Chameleon lied to Hare.
Hare left and Chameleon went back into his house.
“I am the clever one,” Chameleon boasted aloud, jumping onto the couch.
In the days that followed, Lizard, Frog and Tortoise also came looking for the chameleon who had borrowed rice, meat and fruit from them.
Chameleon tricked each one by changing his skin colour so that they would not recognise him.
Another month passed by.
Then Hare, Lizard, Frog and Tortoise met by a big marula tree to gather its delicious golden fruit.
Looking at his basket of marulas, Tortoise said, “A green chameleon has moved in at the brown chameleon’s house.
That brown chameleon owes me a bucket of fruit.”
“No,” said Hare.
“A yellow chameleon stays at that house.
I am looking for the green chameleon who owes me a bucket of maize meal.”
“No,” Lizard said.
“A black chameleon stays at that house.
I am looking for the yellow chameleon who owes me a bucket of rice.”
“No,” Lizard said.
“A black chameleon stays at that house.
I am looking for the black chameleon who owes me a bucket of meat.”
Then Lizard said, “Could it be that one chameleon has tricked us all by changing his skin colour?
Let’s all go to the house at the same time.”
So Hare, Lizard, Frog and Tortoise marched to Chameleon’s house and shouted for him to come out.
Chameleon peeped through the window at the angry animals.
He felt ashamed that his laziness had brought him so much trouble, so he went out and begged Hare, Lizard, Frog and Tortoise to forgive him.
Hare, Lizard, Frog and Tortoise agreed to forgive Chameleon.
“But never again will you get anything from any one of us,” they said.
And from that day on, the lazy chameleon had to work for his food just like everyone else.
* Was Chameleon borrowing or stealing when he took things from Hare, Frog, Tortoise and Lizard?
What is the difference between stealing and borrowing?
* Why do you think it is good to pay back what you borrowed?
* Imagine that you don’t want people to know who you are.
Use old clothes, hats, pieces of material and sunglasses to change how you look.

It was a hot day in the African savannah when Rabbit decided to walk down to the stream to drink some water.
She was hopping along slowly in the heat along an open dusty path when she saw a mirror flashing in the sunlight.
Rabbit had never seen a mirror before, so she wondered what the strange animal was.
As she got closer, to her surprise, she saw the veld inside it and a little white rabbit just like herself looking back.
Rabbit ran as fast as she could to call for help.
“Help!
Somebody please help me!” she cried.
Jackal was resting in the shade of a big tree after hunting.
When he heard Rabbit’s calls for help, he pretended he had not heard anything and hoped that other animals would help her because he was tired.
But before he knew it, Rabbit ran towards where he was resting.
“Jackal, help!
A monster, a monster!” cried the little white rabbit.
“A monster?
Where?” asked Jackal, yawning.
“Down by the path on the way to the river.
It has swallowed the whole veld and a little white rabbit like me,” sobbed Rabbit.
At first Jackal chased Rabbit away because he could not believe such a thing had happened.
“If the monster has swallowed the veld, why are we here and not inside the monster?”
Rabbit could not answer that question, but she kept on asking for help.
Jackal went to call Leopard so that all three of them could go together to see the strange monster.
Jackal and Leopard followed Rabbit to where the monster was.
Slowly, they crept up to the mirror.
When they got up close, they saw three animals looking at them.
The animals inside the monster’s stomach looked just like them!
They screamed in fright and ran down to the river to call Hippo.
“Hippo, please come and help us.
A monster has swallowed the veld and three animals just like us!” said Jackal, talking as fast as possible.
Hippo didn’t pay much attention to them and continued to enjoy her swim because she thought the animals were trying to trick her.
But when she saw how terrified they were, she got out of the water.
Then Hippo, Leopard, Jackal and Rabbit rushed to the place where the mirror was.
When they got there, Rabbit and Jackal stayed behind because they were scared that the strange animal would swallow them too.
Leopard and Hippo ran forward to attack the strange animal … but when they saw another hippo and leopard running towards them, they ran away screaming, “A monster!
A monster!”
The four animals ran to find Lion and told him the story of the strange animal.
“It swallowed a rabbit, a jackal, a leopard and a hippo,” explained the animals, all talking at the same time.
“It also swallowed the whole veld,” added Rabbit.
“And the animals in its stomach wanted to attack us!” said Hippo.
Lion had never heard of such a thing, so he immediately called his pride of lions together and they rushed off to attack the monster.
On their way, they came across Monkey, who looked like he was searching for something.
He jumped in front of Lion.
“Oh Lion, I am so glad to see you,” he said.
“Please help me find my mirror.
I think someone has stolen it.”
“Out of the way, Monkey.
We have something more important to do.
We are rushing to attack a monster that has swallowed animals and the veld,” said Lion impatiently.
The monkey moved out of the way but decided to follow the animals because he wanted to see what this monster looked like.
When the animals got near to where the mirror was, the lions, Hippo and Leopard stood still and prepared to attack.
Then they ran towards the mirror!
Then some of them lay flat on the ground, some hid behind bossies and some climbed into the trees.
Then some of them lay flat on the ground, some hid behind bossies and some climbed into the trees.
When the monkey realised that what the animals were terrified of was his mirror, he burst out laughing.
He ran to it and, looking at himself laughing, said, “I have been looking for you the whole day, my mirror.”
When the other animals saw Monkey in front of the strange animal and how friendly the monster was to him, they crept out from where they were hiding and started asking Monkey questions about the strange animal.
“This is a mirror, it’s not an animal.
You look at yourself in it.
See, that’s me in the mirror,” explained Monkey, holding up the mirror.
When the other animals saw Monkey in front of the strange animal and how friendly the monster was to him, they crept out from where they were hiding and started asking Monkey questions about the strange animal.
Once upon a time, there was an old woman who sold the best soup at the village market.
It was delicious, hot chicken soup.
Nobody in the village knew the old woman’s name.
Nobody knew where she lived.
And nobody knew why her soup was so tasty nor why it was so hot.
They did not even think about these things.
They just bought the soup and ate it.
Each morning, the old woman would come to the market.
She always carried the big black pot filled with chicken soup on her head and then sat down with it under a tree in the shade.
Before long, she would have sold all the soup.
Then she would carefully fold her money in a cloth, put it in her pocket, put the empty pot back on her head and leave.
There was a boy called Fezile who lived in the village not far from the market.
He liked the chicken soup very much.
Actually, he loved it and could not get enough.
He wanted to find out where the old woman who made such delicious soup came from.
One day when the old woman put her empty pot on her head and left the market, Fezile followed her.
He was careful to stay in the shadows, and behind the trees and bushes, so that she did not see him.
He followed her a long, long way down a path that led away from the village and then up a steep hill.
He was still climbing up, up, up when evening came.
Fezile was afraid, but he kept on walking.
At last, the woman came to a little house on the steep hill.
She put the pot down in front of the house.
Fezile waited until the woman had gone inside the house and closed the door.
Then he crept closer to look inside the pot.
Suddenly, Fezile heard the door opening.
Quickly he hid in a place where he could see the old woman easily.
She walked up to the pot and began to sing:
“Magic pot, magic pot,
Make soup for me, so hot, hot, hot.
Make chicken soup.
Make chicken soup.
Make soup for me to sell and for people to buy.
Oh magic pot, oh magic pot!”
Very soon the pot was filled with chicken soup!
Steam came out of the big black pot and the smell was so good that it made Fezile hungry.
He looked under it.
Although the pot was filled to the brim with hot chicken soup, there was no fire burning under it.
“I must have some of this soup,” Fezile said to himself.
“I am so hungry!” He stretched forward and put his hand into the pot to take a piece of chicken.
Suddenly the old woman came out of her house and saw Fezile with his hand in the pot.
“OH!
“OH!
Oh!” she cried.
“NO!
NO!
NO!” Fezile turned and ran as fast as he could.
The old woman ran after him, shouting, but she couldn’t catch him.
Fezile ran and ran until, at last, he was safely home.
He told his mother and father all about the old woman and her magic pot.
They all went outside and looked up at the hill, and there they saw steam rising into the sky.
“Yes,” said Fezile’s parents, “look at that.
We can see the steam from the magic pot.” The old woman never returned to the market and no one went up that steep hill to visit her.
They were all too afraid.
But from then on, when anyone in the village sees clouds around the top of the hill, they say, “Look!
Look up there!
We can see the steam from the magic pot.” The old woman never returned to the market and no one went up that steep hill to visit her.
Once upon a time in the Kgalagadi, there was a powerful old man named Rapula.
Rapula had one of the greatest gifts in the world.
He had the power to bring the clouds close together when they were far apart.
He had the power to make it rain.
He was known all over the land as Rapula, the rainmaker.
For Rapula, making rain was a very painful process.
It took all the energy he had, but it also gave him joy to see his people benefit from the water falling from the clouds.
When it rained, the people would collect the water and use it for drinking and cooking.
The rivers would fill up and so the animals had water to drink.
The rain also fed the farmlands of the Kgalagadi.
After many years of making rain, Rapula, the rainmaker, became ill and his power weakened.
The land of the Kgalagadi slowly started to dry up.
The green grass and the trees started to disappear.
Although the old man kept trying, he could only make small amounts of rain.
And each time he tried, he became weaker and weaker.
Soon the old man became so ill and weak that he could not make any rain at all.
When that happened, there was a great drought.
The lands dried up and the crops failed.
There was not enough food.
Animals died, plants died, and people died.
Animals died, plants died, and people died.
They still hoped that the rainmaker would get well again.
While they waited, they shared what little they had with each other and they gave the rainmaker the best food they had.
“Maybe he will get back his strength soon,” they said.
Eventually the people realised that Rapula would never get better.
The wise men of the village knew that all they could do now, was wait for Rapula to pass on his special power to someone else.
When Rapula, the rainmaker, died, the people of the Kgalagadi were sad.
They had lost a valuable member of their community.
However, the elders of the village took comfort in knowing that Rapula’s gift would not be lost.
It would be passed on to a younger person.
There was a big funeral to honour the great rainmaker.
People came from the faraway parts of the Kgalagadi to be there.
They brought with them the little food and drink they had to share with everyone.
Before Rapula, the rainmaker, could be buried in the ground to rest forever, a strange thing happened – something that would show the people of the Kgalagadi who the new rainmaker would be.
The colours of the rainbow left the old rainmaker’s body and entered into a young girl named Mapula, who was Rapula’s great-grandchild.
This was the most amazing thing anyone had ever seen, but everyone knew that it was the way that rainmakers passed on their power.
It happened very seldom because rainmakers lived for many, many years.
Mapula was now the new rainmaker of the Kgalagadi.
For days after the funeral, the people celebrated the young girl’s new power.
They celebrated with music and food.
Everyone in the Kgalagadi brought her gifts of new clothing, flowers, special foods and other things.
It took a few days for Mapula to get used to her power, but soon they became stronger.
Now she had to use her gift properly.
If she was angry while making rain, she could create a thunderstorm or a flood.
This could destroy her entire community.
Even though the Kgalagadi had been without rain for so long, Mapula had to learn slowly how to use her power.
First, she learnt to make it rain a little by bringing small clouds together.
She practised doing this once a week.
Just like her great-grandfather, she became very tired after making the clouds rain.
At times she had to sleep for two days to regain her strength.
The people of the Kgalagadi were clever.
They learnt how to build dams and make big tanks to store water in.
After many months of practise, Mapula was finally able to bring good rains to the Kgalagadi again.
Everyone celebrated the big rain with dancing and singing.
It had been many years since they had seen that much rain and they knew that the drought was finally over.
They were happy that there was a new rainmaker – a rainmaker who would make everyone’s life better.
Get creative!
After you have read The rainmaker, suggest that your children create rain pictures.
They could use cotton wool for the clouds and then cut out raindrops from blue paper.
Or, they could finger paint the clouds and the rain.
They could use cotton wool for the clouds and then cut out raindrops from blue paper.
Flossie, the field mouse, scurried through the grass as fast as her little legs could carry her.
“Eish!
Eish!” she gasped, “I will never get home in time!”
The sun was already setting.
Dark shadows lay all around her.
“Eish!
Soon it will be night.
And then the silver moon monster will be looking for me!”
Flossie was terrified of the moon monster.
She often had nightmares about him.
But now she couldn’t run any further.
Her legs were hurting, her chest was aching.
She was just too tired.
She stopped beside an old tree and crept in amongst its roots.
Would she be safe here?
“Good evening!” said a deep voice from somewhere above her.
Flossie looked up and squeaked in fright.
Two round eyes were staring down at her.
Two gigantic shiny eyes!
Flossie’s heart beat hard and fast inside her chest.
Any creature with such huge eyes must surely be very, very big!
“Who are you?” asked Flossie in a shaky voice.
“Are you the moon monster?”
The deep voice laughed a furry laugh.
“No, I’m not a monster.
I’m just a moth.
You can call me Maxwell.”
I’m just a moth.
Flossie couldn’t believe it!
What kind of moth had such gigantic eyes?
“Are you a giant moth?” she asked
Maxwell laughed his furry laugh again.
“Hawu!
Those aren’t my eyes,” he said.
“Those shiny circles are just patterns on my wings.
Look here!” And Maxwell flapped his wings so that Flossie could see how the shiny round patterns moved: up and down, up and down.
Maxwell scuttled down the side of the tree trunk, closer to the field mouse.
It was nice to have someone to talk to.
Not many creatures were out and about at night.
“Tell me,” he said.
“Why were you in such a hurry?
I saw you scurrying through the grass as fast as your little legs would go.”
“I was trying to get home before dark,” said Flossie.
“But it’s no use now.
Night is already here, and my home is still far away.” She began to cry little field mouse tears.
Maxwell didn’t understand.
“But why do you want to be home?” he asked.
“Why do you want to be inside now?
Hawu!
Night is the loveliest time of all.
You can watch the moon rise above the hills.
You can see the grass turn silver.
You can hear the wind whisper through the leaves.”
Flossie shook her head.
“No, no!
Night is a terrible time.
Night is when the silver moon monster comes out and goes hunting.”
“The silver moon monster?
Never heard of him!” Maxwell said.
So Flossie explained: the silver moon monster flew on silver wings that stretched out wider than a tree.
He flew out from the light of the moon, his dark shadow sweeping along the ground.
He flew in terrible silence; searching, searching for little mice.
He flew out from the light of the moon, his dark shadow sweeping along the ground.
Maxwell shook his head and let out another deep, furry laugh.
“Hawu!
That’s not a monster!
That’s just an owl.
He’s not silver at all; he’s just a dull brown colour.
Who’s scared of a boring old owl?”
“Eish!
Don’t say that!” squeaked Flossie in alarm.
“Maybe the silver moon monster hunts for moths as well!”
“Ha!” said Maxwell confidently.
“I’d like to see him try!”
Just then, something moved in the air above them.
Flossie looked up to see a huge silver shape flying down from the light of the moon.
Two huge silver wings spread wide, casting a dark shadow across the tree roots.
Flossie was too terrified to move.
She closed her little eyes tightly as the whooshing sound came closer … and closer.
She knew what was going to happen next.
All her most terrible nightmares were about to come true.
Suddenly there was a loud, ugly screech, then a flurry of huge wings.
And then silence.
“You can open your eyes now,” said Maxwell.
Flossie opened her eyes to see the owl disappearing over the treetops.
“What happened?” she asked in amazement.
“What happened?” she asked in amazement.
“Why did the moon monster fly away?”
Maxwell was very pleased with himself.
“It’s the patterns on my wings.
The owl thought they were eyes – just like you did.
And just like you, he thought anyone with such gigantic eyes must be a huge creature.
He got quite a fright, let me tell you!
Did you hear how he screeched?”
“How clever!” said Flossie.
“Yes, I am, aren’t I?” agreed Maxwell.
“Now you just sleep here close to me.
You’ll be safe until sunrise.”
So Flossie snuggled up amongst the roots of the tree.
Soon she was fast asleep.
And she didn’t dream about the silver moon monster at all.
Not once.
* Use toilet rolls, paper, glue, toothpicks and paint or crayons to make a moth.
Cut out the shape of the moth’s wings, colour them and, when they are dry, glue them to the toilet roll.
Paint the toothpicks black and attach them to the moth to create its feelers.
In the old days, Oxpecker had a bright yellow bill.
He lived in a little hut in a patch of long grass.
Each day he would sweep his hut before setting off into the grass to catch his favourite food.
At night he would climb into his nestbed, his belly full of green grasshoppers, flies and wriggly worms.
If anyone came into the patch of long grass, Oxpecker would fly up and shout at them.
He would peck them and make a fuss until they went away.
He liked to live alone, and he didn’t want to share with anyone.
One day, while Oxpecker was out searching for insects, he heard a low rumble,
“What now?” shrieked Oxpecker, flying up out of the long grass to get a better view.
A big, black animal with heavy horns was walking through the long grass.
A big, black animal with heavy horns was walking through the long grass.
“Hello,” said Buffalo.
“I haven’t eaten anything in weeks.
This long grass is exactly what I need.
May I have some?”
“No!
Go away!” shouted Oxpecker.
“Well, I’ll die if I don’t eat something.
There hasn’t been any rain for months.
This is the only patch of long grass around here.
Won’t you let me eat some of it, please?” “Didn’t you hear me?
Won’t you let me eat some of it, please?” “Didn’t you hear me?
Go away!” said Oxpecker flying around Buffalo’s head.
“But you don’t even eat grass,” Buffalo said.
“We could share the grass.” “I don’t share!
This is mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Now go away!” shouted Oxpecker.
Buffalo’s forehead wrinkled and his eyes narrowed to slits.
He got so angry that his tail swished back and forth,
making a loud clapping sound as it struck the sides of his rump.
“Well, if you are going to be rude, I’m going to eat it anyway.
I eat grass, that is what I do, and I am hungry, so here I GO, you rude bird,” said Buffalo about to chomp on some grass.
“You wouldn’t dare!” shrieked Oxpecker.
“How are you going to stop me?
Look at how big I am.
And because you’re being so rude,
I’ve decided that I’m going to eat and eat and eat until I’m full.” And with a loud MUNCH!
CRUNCH!
Buffalo started to eat.
This made Oxpecker so angry that the end of his beak turned bright red.
Oxpecker flew around Buffalo’s head shouting and shrieking and whooping,
Oxpecker flew around Buffalo’s head shouting and shrieking and whooping,
Soon all the long grass was gone.
To make matters worse, Buffalo put his big hoof right through the roof of Oxpecker’s hut.
Oxpecker flew up onto Buffalo’s back and started pecking away at his skin.
“That’s not going to work,” said Buffalo.
“My skin is very thick.
Even Lion has tried to bite me with his sharp teeth and I got away.
You are too small, Oxpecker.
“My skin is very thick.
I was willing to share.”
You are too small, Oxpecker.
“I was only angry and rude because that was my home.
Now I have no home and no food – all those delicious green grasshoppers, flies and wriggly worms that lived in the long grass are gone!
Everything’s gone.”
Buffalo looked back at Oxpecker, who was crying, and then to the bare patch of earth and the broken hut.
“I’m sorry I destroyed your home,” he said,
I have a problem with insects, you see.
I mean, just take a look at my back.
There are always far too many insects hanging on and crawling all over me.
You could eat them, and it would be really nice to have someone finally get rid of them for me.”
Oxpecker looked up and down Buffalo’s body and noticed all the little insects clinging to Buffalo’s skin.
but the thought of doing Buffalo a favour after everything he had done, made Oxpecker angrier and angrier.
The bird’s tummy rumbled,
“First you ate all my lovely grass!” shouted Oxpecker.
“Then you wrecked my house.
You actually put your big hoof right through the roof!
Now you want me to eat all these insects as a favour!” He walked up and down Buffalo’s back, pecking at the insects as he talked.
Now you want me to eat all these insects as a favour!” He walked up and down Buffalo’s back, pecking at the insects as he talked.
“You really are the worst, Buffalo!
As if I would help you,” he said with his little mouth full of insects.
Buffalo simply shrugged and walked off with Oxpecker riding on his back, shouting and eating insects.

Timi and his mother lived in Mozala Town.
There was something very unusual about Timi – his hair!
It grew very quickly.
It grew so quickly that every Saturday, Timi’s mother had to take him to the barber to have his hair cut.
And if there was one thing that Timi really didn’t like, it was having his hair cut!
Haircut time was worry time for Mom because Timi would cry.
“I don’t want to have my hair cut!” he always said.
Mom would cuddle him before they set off to the barbershop, but as soon as they arrived, Timi would burst into tears.
Then Mom would have to do all sorts of things to try to get Timi to sit still while he was having his hair cut.
Sometimes she would give him some biscuits.
Timi loved biscuits, but he would gobble them down and start crying again.
Sometimes Mom would break into a dance.
She would dance to the left.
She would dance to the right.
She would shake her body, but Timi just cried and cried.
As soon as Jango, the barber, got ready to cut Timi’s hair, Timi got ready to cry even more!
First, he would sniffle, then he would sob, and then he would let out a loud cry, “Hiyaa, hiyaa, hiyaa!” “It’s only a haircut, Timi.
It’s not painful,” Jango would say, trying to calm Timi down, but that made Timi cry even louder.
Sometimes Jango would sing to comfort Timi, but still Timi kept crying.
One day, Timi cried so loudly that some passers-by peeped into the barbershop to see what would make a boy cry so loudly!
“Oh, my goodness!
It is only a young boy having his hair cut,” they said.
Timi did not care that people came to stare at him.
He cried and cried until Jango had finished cutting his hair.
Another day, he wailed so loudly that Grandma Binite came limping in with her walking stick.
She lived next door to the barbershop, but had been woken up from her afternoon nap by Timi’s loud wails.
“Oh, my word!” Grandma Binite said.
“I thought something terrible was going on!” Then she limped back to her house to get Timi a piece of tasty grilled fish she had made.
“I’m sure this will make him stop crying,” she thought.
But when she gave Timi the fish, he popped it into his mouth, chewed and swallowed … and then went on crying!
After Timi had left with his mother that day, Jango sat down with a cup of tea and thought and thought.
Surely there had to be a way to stop Timi from crying while his hair was being cut!
And that’s when Jango had his good idea!
“That’s it!
I’ve solved it,” he shouted excitedly.
On Timi’s next visit, as soon as Jango took out his scissors, he began to tell Timi a story.
“Once there was a young boy who did not like to get his hair cut, so he let it grow and grow,” said Jango.
“It grew until his head was full of knotty strands of hair.
Soon the knotty strands became twisted together.” “What happened next?” asked Timi, who had stopped crying.
Soon the knotty strands became twisted together.” “What happened next?” asked Timi, who had stopped crying.
“The young boy began to pull at his hair and to scratch because the insects that were crawling around on his head made it very, very itchy.
He pulled and scratched, and pulled and scratched all day long.
Soon, his head and his hands began to hurt from all the pulling and scratching,” said Jango.
“Oh, how awful!
What happened next?” asked Timi, feeling sorry for the boy.
“His head and hands became swollen,” continued Jango.
“One day, his mom brought him to my shop.
As soon as they got here, he hopped on the chair to have his haircut.
He sat still so that I could give him the best haircut ever.”
“Really?” asked Timi.
“Oh, yes!” said Jango.
“And when I had finished cutting the boy’s hair – just as I have done yours now – the boy gave me a very big hug.” Timi looked at his head.
His haircut was finished!
He had been enjoying the story so much that he hadn’t noticed Jango cutting his hair.
He jumped out of the chair and gave Jango a big hug.
And do you know what?
Timi never cried again at the barbershop because Jango had a new story to tell him at every visit!
Timi never cried again at the barbershop because Jango had a new story to tell him at every visit!
It was Tuesday and there was no school.
All the children were meeting at the library for a special day.
It was International Literacy Day and people all over the world were going to read and write and listen to stories on the same day.
Neo was so excited.
His favourite author, Joan Rankin, was coming to the library to read from the books she had written, and his dad had promised to take him to see her.
Neo had written a special book about her, and he couldn’t wait to give it to her.
But when Neo got up on Tuesday morning, there was a funny noise coming from the kitchen.
He went to look.
The washing machine was making a terrible rattling, coughing noise as if it was going to explode.
Neo’s dad came to see.
“Oh no!” he said.
“The pump must be broken.
It’s going to cost so much to get it fixed.
We might have to buy a whole new washing machine.”
“We can’t afford a new washing machine,” Neo’s mom said.
“Please, can’t you fix it?
I have to go to work, and there’s so much dirty washing.”
Dad hated seeing Neo’s mom so upset so he said, “I’ll fix it.
Neo will help me.
I’ll find a website that shows me how to mend broken washing machines.”
“But, Dad, you promised to take me to the library,” said Neo.
“That will have to wait, Neo.
The washing machine is more important.
Maybe Gogo can take you,” said Dad.
“I’m going out today,” said Gogo, shaking her head.
“I’m sorry, Neo.
You’ll have to go next week.”
Neo was very upset.
“But, Dad, you promised me you would take me to the library,” he said.
“We have to go soon.”
Dad fetched his toolbox and googled, “How to fix a washing machine pump” on his cellphone.
“Here you go,” he said to Neo, showing him the page.
“This doesn’t look too difficult.” And with that, he pulled the washing machine out and turned it around so he could take off the back.
But fixing the machine was more difficult than it looked.
“There’s a drawing here,” Dad grumbled, looking at his phone.
“But it’s so small, I can’t see what goes where.”
Then Dad dropped one of the screws and it rolled under the fridge, so he had to pull the fridge out to get the screw.
Neo looked at the clock.
It was half past nine.
Only half an hour until Joan Rankin arrived at the library.
“Please, Dad,” he said, hopping from one leg to the other.
“Please, hurry so we can go to the library.
We have to go now.”
“I’m busy here and you are not helping, Neo!” Dad looked cross.
Neo was upset.
His father had promised to take him, but now everything was going wrong.
“NO, NO, NO,” yelled Dad.
“I don’t believe it!”
“What?” Neo asked in a small voice.
“Now my phone’s battery is flat!” Dad shouted.
“Please fetch me the charger.”
But at that very moment the power went out.
“Oh no,” said Neo.
“Now the electricity is off.”
Dad seemed very angry.
“This is the worst Tuesday ever.
I’m halfway through fixing the machine and now I can’t read about what to do next.”
Neo nodded.
“Yes, it is the worst Tuesday ever.
You can’t fix the machine, and I’m missing Joan Rankin,” but he didn’t say any more because he could see that Dad was very upset.
Neo slumped down at the kitchen table and hid his head in his arms.
Dad packed away his tools.
“There’s not much we can do now,” he said.
Neo lifted his head a little bit.
The clock said ten to ten.
They could still make it to the library – they’d be late, but he’d still see Joan Rankin and he could still give her his present.
He turned the pages of the little book he’d made.
He’d written the story and drawn the pictures, and Gogo had helped him put it together and make a cover.
Dad was calming down.
He picked up Neo’s book.
“What’s this, Neo?” he asked.
“My book,” Neo said in a tiny voice.
“I was going to give it to my favourite author at the …” He didn’t finish the sentence.
“Come on,” called Dad, grabbing his car keys.
“We have to go NOW!
We can still get to the library in time if we hurry.”
Joan Rankin had begun to read her story to the children when Neo and Dad hurried into the library.
Neo found a seat at the back and settled down to listen.
Her story was wonderful, and so were her pictures.
Neo hoped he’d be able to draw like that one day.
And the best of all?
When she’d finished and Neo showed her his book, she thought it was wonderful.
“Did you really write this story all by yourself?” she asked him.
“Yes,” said Neo.
“And I drew the pictures too.
It’s a present for you, Ma’am.”
Then Joan Rankin opened her bag and took out one of her books.
Inside she wrote, “For Neo, who makes beautiful books”, and she signed her name in big letters and gave it to him.
Neo was so happy.
He held the book so tightly he never wanted to let it go.
Just then Dad came over.
“You won’t believe it,” he said.
“I found a book on how to fix washing machines, and look − the drawings are big and clear.
Why didn’t you tell me the library had books like this, Neo?”
Dad gave Neo a hug.
“Books are awesome.
Their batteries never run flat, and you can even read them when the electricity goes off.”
Neo smiled a happy smile and nodded.
That was true.
You can read a book anywhere and anytime.
Once upon a time, many, many moons ago, there was a bush rat calledLegotlo.Legotlowas a close friend ofMamanthwane– the bat.
The two of them were always together.ButMamanthwanewas jealous ofLegotlo.Legotlohad many friends and everyone liked him more than the bat.Legotloalso had a wife who loved him very much.
When the bat cooked, the food was always very good.“How is it that when you make the soup it is so tasty?” asked the bush rat.“I always boil myself in the water, and my flesh is sweet.
He got a pot of warm water that was not hot enough to burn anyone, but he toldLegotlothat the water was boiling hot.

“It’s a secret!” saidLegotlo.Legotloasked his wife to boil some water, which she did.
Help me!” he screamed.
The bush rat’s wife rushed to pull him out, but the damage had already been done.Legotlowas so badly burned that he had lost all his fur.
“Why would you get into a pot of boiling water?” his wife asked.

WhenMamanthwaneserved the soup, it tasted as good as usual.Legotlowas amazed.
They ordered all the people of the village to find the bat so that he could be punished.
They were right – they foundMamanthwanehiding there in a tree.
They waited until he was asleep, then they caught him and took him straight to the king and queen.When they arrived at the royal house,Legotloand his wife were already there.Mamanthwanewas ashamed to look his friend,Legotlo, in the eye.
His skin was red and pink from the hot water.
We were best friends!”Legotlosaid to the bat.
The bush rat’s wife rushed to pull him out, but the damage had already been done.Legotlowas so badly burned that he had lost all his fur.
They wondered whyMamanthwanehadn’t just asked his friend how he had managed to get everyone to love him.Then the king said, “Well, you have just given everyone a reason to hate you even more.”The king and queen ordered the guards to takeMamanthwaneto jail.
He got a pot of warm water that was not hot enough to burn anyone, but he toldLegotlothat the water was boiling hot.
The king and queen were also very angry.
The bat was jealous of all these things thatLegotlohad.
They ordered the people in the village to search for the bat again.All day long the people tried to find and catchMamanthwane, but they failed.Mamanthwanehad found a cave far away from the village that no one knew about.
And so, that is why even today, you will never seeMamanthwane, the bat, during the day.
Mama Tau was coming home!
She had been away for a long time studying, and her family missed her.
Everyone was very excited.
But Thapelo, the youngest of all her children, was the most excited.
On the day of Mama Tau’s arrival, the family spent the morning preparing.
The sun was shining outside.
Thapelo kicked his ball around on the grass.
He wanted to show his mother how much better his soccer was since the last time she had seen him.
“Catch this one, Bless,” he shouted to the dog.
But Bless just looked at the ball and went inside.
Thapelo followed the dog and went to find his older sister, Refilwe.
Refilwe was a DJ.
She was so cool that she wore her sunglasses even inside the house.
Refilwe was in her room getting music to play for when Mama walked through the front door.
“I’m not going to play any of that rap she complains about,” Refilwe said.
“Today we will only hear jazz.
Just how Mama likes it.” She took off her sunglasses and winked at Thapelo.
“Maybe you can dance with Mama.”
Then Refilwe put on her headphones and started nodding her head to the music.
“Can I help you?” asked Thapelo.
“What?” said Refilwe, taking off her headphones.
“What did you say?”
“Can I help you?” Thapelo shouted.
“No need to shout,” Refilwe said.
“I can hear you perfectly.” Then she shook her head.
“This is all on the computer, Thapelo.
So, you can’t help.
You’re too small.
Thapelo went to find his brother, Saul.
He was in the kitchen, baking one of his very special cakes.
Whenever there was a special occasion, Saul made a cake.
For Thapelo’s last birthday, he had made a chocolate cake with Smarties on top.
Saul was wearing a striped apron and was stirring the cake mixture in a big bowl.
“This is a lemon cake,” he told Thapelo.
“Mama’s favourite.”
“Can I help you?” asked Thapelo.
“No,” he said.
“Last time you dropped an egg.
Sorry, Thapelo.
You’re too small.”
He went to find his other sister, Mampotoko, who was putting up decorations in the lounge.
There were paper chains and balloons.
“Can I help you?” he asked.
“Here, see if you can blow these up,” she said, handing Thapelo some balloons.
He chose a red one and started blowing.
He tried and he tried but he couldn’t get enough air into it.
“Oh no,” he said sadly.
“I’m too small.”
He was sitting at the table, wrapping up a bead necklace for Mama.
He was sitting at the table, wrapping up a bead necklace for Mama.
“This necklace has her favourite colours,” he said.
“Purple and green.
Isn’t it beautiful?”
Thapelo saw the wrapping paper with stars on it.
“Can I help you wrap the necklace?” asked Thapelo.
“No, sorry, Thapelo, you’re too small,” his father said.
Thapelo felt sad.
He looked at their dog, Bless, sitting next to Ntate.
“Come, Bless,” he called.
But Bless just sat there.
“Even Bless thinks I’m too small,” Thapelo thought.
Thapelo went outside and sat on the front step.
“I wish I could grow as tall as a giant,” he thought.
“Then they’d all be scared of me and nobody would say, ‘You’re too small.’”
Just then he heard a loud shout from inside the house.
“Bless!
Bless, come back!”
Bless ran past Thapelo and around the corner of the house.
And after Bless ran Ntate.
Then Saul.
Then Refilwe.
Thapelo joined them and ran after Bless too.
“That dog has stolen Mama’s present!” Ntate shouted as he passed Thapelo.
Thapelo joined them and ran after Bless too.
Bless jumped through a hole in the fence, into the yard next door.
“Come back, Bless!” they called.
And after a while Bless did come back ... but without the present!
“Oh no, he’s left it next door!” Ntate groaned.
“And the Sitholes are away till tomorrow!
So, it’s stuck on the other side of the fence till they come back!”
“I could climb through the hole and fetch it,” suggested Thapelo.
“No,” they all said together.
“You’re too ...” They stopped.
They looked at Thapelo.
“Will you fit?” asked Refilwe.
“Are you small enough?” asked Saul.
Thapelo crouched down and squeezed himself through the hole.
He just fitted through.
There, on the grass in the Sithole’s yard, was the wrapped present, with just a little bit of the wrapping paper torn.
He picked up the present and squeezed back to the other side of the fence.
“Oh, Thapelo,” said Ntate.
“Three cheers for Thapelo!” Saul said, and they all hugged him.
Later that afternoon there was a knock on the door.
It was Mama!
Thapelo rushed into her arms.
“How you’ve grown, my boy,” she said.
“Look at how tall you are now.”
“But I’m still too small, Mama,” he said.
“No!” everyone shouted.
“But I’m still too small, Mama,” he said.
 The Bible presents a clear path to eternal life.
 The Bible presents a clear path to eternal life.
First, we must recognize that we have sinned against God: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
We have all done things that are displeasing to God, which makes us deserving of punishment.
 The Bible presents a clear path to eternal life.
"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
However, Jesus Christ, the sinless (1 Peter 2:22), eternal Son of God became a man (John 1:1,14) and died to pay our penalty.
"God demonstrates His love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).
Jesus Christ died on the cross (John 19:31-42), taking the punishment that we deserve (2 Corinthians 5:21).
Three days later He rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4), proving His victory over sin and death.
"In His great mercy He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" (1 Peter 1:3).
By faith, we must change our mindset regarding Christ - who He is, what He did, and why - for salvation (Acts 3:19).&nbsp;If we place our faith in Him, trusting His death on the cross to pay for our sins, we will be forgiven and receive the promise of eternal life in heaven.
By faith, we must change our mindset regarding Christ - who He is, what He did, and why - for salvation (Acts 3:19).&nbsp;If we place our faith in Him, trusting His death on the cross to pay for our sins, we will be forgiven and receive the promise of eternal life in heaven.
"For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son so that anyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).
"If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9).
Faith alone in the finished work of Christ on the cross is the only true path to eternal life!
"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, here is a sample prayer.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and deserve punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
No one deserves to be forgiven.
No one deserves to be forgiven.
 Acts 13:38 declares, "Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
What is forgiveness and why do I need it?
 The word "forgive" means to wipe the slate clean, to pardon, to cancel a debt.
When we wrong someone, we seek their forgiveness in order for the relationship to be restored.
Forgiveness is not granted because a person deserves to be forgiven.
No one deserves to be forgiven.
Forgiveness is an act of love, mercy, and grace.
Forgiveness is a decision to not hold something against another person, despite what they have done to you.
The Bible tells us that we are all in need of forgiveness from God.
We have all committed sin.
First John 1:8 says, "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."
As a result, we desperately need God’s forgiveness.
If our sins are not forgiven, we will spend eternity suffering the consequences of our sins (Matthew 25:46; John 3:36).
Forgiveness – How do I get it?
 Thankfully, God is loving and merciful – eager to forgive us of our sins!
2 Peter 3:9 tells us, "…He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."
The only just penalty for our sins is death.
The first half of Romans 6:23 declares, "For the wages of sin is death…" Eternal death is what we have earned for our sins.
God, in His perfect plan, became a human being – Jesus Christ (John 1:1,14).
Jesus died on the cross, taking the punishment that we deserve!
Second Corinthians 5:21 teaches us, "God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God."
As God, Jesus’ death provided forgiveness for the sins of the entire world.
1 John 2:2 proclaims, "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."
Praise God, through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the second half of Romans 6:23 is true, "…but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Do you want to have your sins forgiven?
Do you have a nagging feeling of guilt that you can’t seem to get to go away?
Forgiveness of your sins is available if you will place your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.
Ephesians 1:7 says, "In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace."
All you have to do is ask God to forgive you through Jesus, believing that Jesus died to pay for your forgiveness – and He will forgive you!
John 3:16-17 contains this wonderful message, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him."
Forgiveness – is it really that easy?
 Yes it is that easy!
You can’t earn forgiveness from God.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and to thank Him for providing for your forgiveness.
You can only receive it, by faith, through the grace and mercy of God.
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and receive forgiveness from God, here is a prayer you can pray.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and to thank Him for providing for your forgiveness.

 Do you know for certain that you have eternal life and that you will go to heaven when you die?
 Do you know for certain that you have eternal life and that you will go to heaven when you die?
 Do you know for certain that you have eternal life and that you will go to heaven when you die?
God wants you to be sure!
The Bible says: “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (1 John 5:13).
Suppose you were standing before God right now and He asked you, “Why should I let you into heaven?” What would you say?
You may not know what to reply.
What you need to know is that God loves us and has provided a way that we can know for sure where we will spend eternity.
The Bible states it this way: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
We have to first understand the problem that is keeping us from heaven.
The problem is this - our sinful nature keeps us from having a relationship with God.
We are sinners by nature and by choice.
“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).
We cannot save ourselves.
“For by grace are you saved, through faith, and this not of yourselves – it is the gift of God.
Not by works, so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9).
We deserve death and hell.
“For the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).
God is holy and just and must punish sin, yet He loves us and has provided forgiveness for our sin.
God is holy and just and must punish sin, yet He loves us and has provided forgiveness for our sin.
Jesus said: “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
Jesus died for us on the cross: “For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous to bring you to God” (1 Peter 3:18).
Jesus was resurrected from the dead: “He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification” (Romans 4:25).
So, back to the original question – “How can I know for sure that I will go to heaven when I die?” The answer is this – believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved (Acts 16:31).
“To all who received Him, to those who believed in His Name, He gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).
You can receive eternal life as a FREE gift.
“The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).
You can live a full and meaningful life right now.
Jesus said: “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
You can spend eternity with Jesus in heaven, for He promised: “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you may also be where I am” (John 14:3).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and receive forgiveness from God, here is prayer you can pray.
Saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Jesus Christ that can provide forgiveness of sins.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your forgiveness.
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.&nbsp;But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.&nbsp;But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
What is the prayer of salvation?
 What does it mean to accept Jesus as your personal Savior?
   Return to:
 In order to get “right” with God, we must first understand what is “wrong.” The answer is sin.
 In order to get “right” with God, we must first understand what is “wrong.” The answer is sin.
Jesus declared His purpose was “to seek and to save what was lost” (Luke 19:10), and He pronounced His purpose accomplished when He died on the cross with the words, “It is finished!” (John 19:30).
“There is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 14:3).
“The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4).
The bad news is that the penalty for sin is death.
“The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4).
The good news is that a loving God has pursued us in order to bring us salvation.
Jesus declared His purpose was “to seek and to save what was lost” (Luke 19:10), and He pronounced His purpose accomplished when He died on the cross with the words, “It is finished!” (John 19:30).
The good news is that a loving God has pursued us in order to bring us salvation.
A beautiful illustration of repentance and forgiveness is the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32).
“For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved” (Romans 10:10).
This repentance must be accompanied by faith – specifically, faith that Jesus’ sacrificial death and miraculous resurrection qualify Him to be your Savior.
“If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9).
Many other passages speak of the necessity of faith, such as John 20:27; Acts 16:31; Galatians 2:16; 3:11, 26; and Ephesians 2:8.
Being right with God is a matter of your response to what God has done on your behalf.
He sent the Savior, He provided the sacrifice to take away your sin (John 1:29), and He offers you the promise: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Acts 2:21).
A beautiful illustration of repentance and forgiveness is the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32).
The younger son wasted his father’s gift in shameful sin (verse 13).
When he acknowledged his wrongdoing, he decided to return home (verse 18).
He assumed he would no longer be considered a son (verse 19), but he was wrong.
The father loved the returned rebel as much as ever (verse 20).
All was forgiven, and a celebration ensued (verse 24).
God is good to keep His promises, including the promise to forgive.
“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18).
If you want to get right with God, here is a sample prayer.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against You and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.

Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness – the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
How do I begin my journey with God?” The five steps mentioned below will give you direction from the Bible.
 Congratulations!
You have made a life-changing decision!
Perhaps you are asking, “Now what?
How do I begin my journey with God?” The five steps mentioned below will give you direction from the Bible.
When you have questions on your journey, please visit www.GotQuestions.org.
1.
Make sure you understand salvation.
 First John 5:13 tells us, “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.” God wants us to understand salvation.
God wants us to have the confidence of knowing for sure that we are saved.
Briefly, let’s go over the key points of salvation:
 (a) We have all sinned.
We have all done things that are displeasing to God (Romans 3:23).
(b) Because of our sin, we deserve to be punished with eternal separation from God (Romans 6:23).
(c) Jesus died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins (Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus died in our place, taking the punishment that we deserved.
Jesus’ resurrection proved that His death was sufficient to pay for our sins.
(d) God grants forgiveness and salvation to all those who place their faith in Jesus—trusting His death as the payment for our sins (John 3:16; Romans 5:1; Romans 8:1).
That is the message of salvation!
If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior, you are saved!
All of your sins are forgiven, and God promises to never leave you or forsake you (Romans 8:38–39; Matthew 28:20).
Remember, your salvation is secure in Jesus Christ (John 10:28–29).
If you are trusting in Jesus alone as your Savior, you can have confidence that you will spend eternity with God in heaven!
2.
Find a good church that teaches the Bible.
 Don’t think of the church as a building.
The church is the  people.
It is very important that believers in Jesus Christ fellowship with one another.
That is one of the primary purposes of the church.
Now that you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ, we strongly encourage you to find a Bible-believing church in your area and speak to the pastor.
Let him know about your new faith in Jesus Christ.
A second purpose of the church is to teach the Bible.
You can learn how to apply God’s instructions to your life.
Understanding the Bible is key to living a successful and powerful Christian life.
2 Timothy 3:16-17 says, “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”
 A third purpose of the church is worship.
Worship is thanking God for all He has done!
God has saved us.
God loves us.
God provides for us.
God guides and directs us.
How could we not thank Him?
God is holy, righteous, loving, merciful, and full of grace.
Revelation 4:11 declares, “You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.”
 3.
Set aside time each day to focus on God.
 It is very important for us to spend time each day focusing  on God.
Some people call this a “quiet time.” Others call it  “devotions,” because it is a time when we devote ourselves to God.
Some people call this a “quiet time.” Others call it  “devotions,” because it is a time when we devote ourselves to God.
Some prefer to set aside time in the mornings, while others prefer the evenings.
It does not matter what you call this time or when you do it.
 It is very important for us to spend time each day focusing  on God.
What events make up our time with God?
(a) Prayer.
Prayer is simply talking to God.
Talk to God about your concerns and problems.
Ask God to give you wisdom and guidance.
Ask God to provide for your needs.
Tell God how much you love Him and how much you appreciate all He does for you.
That is what prayer is all about.
(b) Bible Reading.
In addition to being taught the Bible in church, Sunday School, and/or Bible studies – you need to be reading the Bible for yourself.
The Bible contains everything you need to know in order to live a successful Christian life.
It contains God’s guidance for how to make wise decisions, how to know God’s will, how to minister to others, and how to grow spiritually.
The Bible is God’s Word to us.
The Bible is essentially God’s instruction manual for how to live our lives in a way that is pleasing to Him and satisfying to us.
4.
Develop relationships with people who can help you spiritually.
 1 Corinthians 15:33 tells us, “Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character.’” The Bible is full of warnings about the influence “bad” people can have on us.
Spending time with those who engage in sinful activities will cause us to be tempted by those activities.
The character of those we are around will “rub off” on us.
That is why it is so important to surround ourselves with other people who love the Lord and are committed to Him.
Try to find a friend or two, perhaps from your church, who can help you and encourage you (Hebrews 3:13; 10:24).
Ask your friends to keep you accountable in regard to your quiet time, your activities, and your walk with God.
Ask if you can do the same for them.
This does not mean you have to give up all your friends who do not know the Lord Jesus as their Savior.
Continue to be their friend and love them.
Simply let them know that Jesus has changed your life and you cannot do all the same things you used to do.
Ask God to give you opportunities to share Jesus with your friends.
5.
Be baptized.
 Many people have a misunderstanding of baptism.
The word baptize means “to immerse in water.” Baptism is the biblical way of publicly proclaiming your new faith in Christ and your commitment to follow Him.
The word baptize means “to immerse in water.” Baptism is the biblical way of publicly proclaiming your new faith in Christ and your commitment to follow Him.
The action of being immersed in the water illustrates being buried with Christ.
The action of coming out of the water pictures Christ’s resurrection.
Being baptized is identifying yourself with Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection (Romans 6:3-4).

The word baptize means “to immerse in water.” Baptism is the biblical way of publicly proclaiming your new faith in Christ and your commitment to follow Him.
The action of being immersed in the water illustrates being buried with Christ.

Based on the watch’s design, I would assume it had a designer.
 We know that God is real because He has revealed Himself to us in three ways: in creation, in His Word, and in His Son, Jesus Christ.
My assumption would be that there is an intelligent sender of the message, someone who created the code.
“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse” (Romans 1:20).
“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.” (Psalm 19:1).
If I found a wristwatch in the middle of a field, I would not assume that it just “appeared” out of nowhere or that it had always existed.
Based on the watch’s design, I would assume it had a designer.
But there is far greater design and precision in the world around us.
Our measurement of time is not based on wristwatches, but on God’s handiwork—the regular rotation of the earth (and the radioactive properties of the cesium-133 atom).
The universe displays great design, and this argues for a Great Designer.
If I found an encoded message, I would seek out a cryptographer to help break the code.
My assumption would be that there is an intelligent sender of the message, someone who created the code.
Does not the complexity and purpose of DNA argue for an Intelligent Writer of the code?
Not only has God made an intricate and finely tuned physical world; He has also instilled a sense of eternity in the heart of every person (Ecclesiastes 3:11).
Mankind has an innate perception that there is more to life than meets the eye, that there is an existence higher than this earthly routine.
Our sense of eternity manifests itself in at least two ways: law-making and worship.
Every civilization throughout history has valued certain moral laws, which are surprisingly similar from culture to culture.
The universe displays great design, and this argues for a Great Designer.
For example, the ideal of love is universally esteemed, while the act of lying is universally condemned.
This common morality—this global understanding of right and wrong—points to a Supreme Moral Being who gave us such scruples.
In the same way, people all over the world, regardless of culture, have always cultivated a system of worship.
The object of worship may vary, but the sense of a “higher power” is an undeniable part of being human.
Our propensity to worship accords with the fact that God created us “in His own image” (Genesis 1:27).
God has also revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible.
Throughout Scripture, the existence of God is treated as a self-evident fact (Genesis 1:1; Exodus 3:14).
When Benjamin Franklin wrote his autobiography, he did not waste time trying to prove his own existence.
God has also revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible.
The life-changing nature of the Bible, its integrity, and the miracles which accompanied its writing should be enough to warrant a closer look.
The third way in which God revealed Himself is through His Son, Jesus Christ (John 14:6-11).
“In the beginning was the Word: the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:1,14; see also Colossians 2:9).
In Jesus’ amazing life, He kept the entire Old Testament law perfectly and fulfilled the prophecies concerning the Messiah (Matthew 5:17).
He performed countless acts of compassion and public miracles to authenticate His message and bear witness to His deity (John 21:24-25).
Then, three days after His crucifixion, He rose from the dead, a fact affirmed by hundreds of eyewitnesses (1 Corinthians 15:6).
The historical record abounds with “proof” of who Jesus is.
As the Apostle Paul said, this thing “was not done in a corner” (Acts 26:26).
We realize that there will always be skeptics who have their own ideas concerning God and will read the evidence accordingly.
And there will be some whom no amount of proof will convince (Psalm 14:1).
And there will be some whom no amount of proof will convince (Psalm 14:1).
It all comes down to faith (Hebrews 11:6).
Is Jesus God?
— Jesus claimed to be God.
It is correct that the Bible never records Jesus saying the precise words, “I am God.” This does not mean, however, that Jesus never claimed to be God.
 Take for example the words of Jesus in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” We need only to look at the Jews’ reaction to His statement to know He was claiming to be God.
Jesus does not correct him.
They tried to stone Him for this very reason: “You, a mere man, claim to be God” (John 10:33, emphasis added).
The Jews understood exactly what Jesus was claiming—deity.
 Some who deny that Jesus is God make the claim that Jesus never said that He is God.
When Jesus declared, “I and the Father are one,” He was saying that He and the Father are of one nature and essence.
John 8:58 is another example.
Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth … before Abraham was born, I am!” This is a reference back to Exodus 3:14 when God revealed Himself as the “I AM.” The Jews who heard this statement responded by taking up stones to kill Him for blasphemy, as the Mosaic Law commanded (Leviticus 24:16).
 John reiterates the concept of Jesus’ deity: “The Word [Jesus] was God” and “the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14).
These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh.
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Jesus Christ.
Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood?
Therefore, Jesus is God.
Thomas the disciple declared concerning Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28).
Jesus does not correct him.
Titus 2:13 encourages us to wait for the coming of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ (see also 2 Peter 1:1).
In Hebrews 1:8, the Father declares of Jesus, “But about the Son He says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.’” The Father refers to Jesus as God, indicating that Jesus is indeed God.
 Some who deny that Jesus is God make the claim that Jesus never said that He is God.
In Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10).
Several times in Scripture Jesus receives worship (Matthew 2:11; 14:33; 28:9, 17; Luke 24:52; John 9:38).
Jesus does not correct him.
If Jesus were not God, He would have told people to not worship Him, just as the angel in Revelation did.
These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh.
 The most important reason that Jesus must be God is that, if He is not God, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).
 The most important reason that Jesus must be God is that, if He is not God, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).
Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death.
If the Bible is the Word of God, then to dismiss it is to dismiss God Himself.
 Our answer to this question will not only determine how we view the Bible and its importance to our lives, but also it will ultimately have an eternal impact on us.
If the Bible is truly God’s Word, then we should cherish it, study it, obey it, and fully trust it.
If the Bible is the Word of God, then to dismiss it is to dismiss God Himself.
The fact that God gave us the Bible is an evidence and illustration of His love for us.
The term “revelation” simply means that God communicated to mankind what He is like and how we can have a right relationship with Him.
These are things that we could not have known had God not divinely revealed them to us in the Bible.
Although God’s revelation of Himself in the Bible was given progressively over approximately 1500 years, it has always contained everything man needs to know about God in order to have a right relationship with Him.
If the Bible is truly the Word of God, then it is the final authority for all matters of faith, religious practice, and morals.
The question we must ask ourselves is how can we know that the Bible is the Word of God and not just a good book?
The question we must ask ourselves is how can we know that the Bible is the Word of God and not just a good book?
These types of questions must be seriously examined if we are to determine the validity of the Bible’s claim to be the very Word of God, divinely inspired, and totally sufficient for all matters of faith and practice.
There can be no doubt that the Bible does claim to be the very Word of God.
This is clearly seen in Paul’s commendation to Timothy: “… from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:15-17).

There are both internal and external evidences that the Bible is truly God’s Word.
The internal evidences are those things within the Bible that testify of its divine origin.
The internal evidences are those things within the Bible that testify of its divine origin.
Another of the internal evidences that indicates the Bible is truly God’s Word is the prophecies contained within its pages.
Even though it is really sixty-six individual books, written on three continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years, by more than 40 authors who came from many walks of life, the Bible remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction.
There simply is no logical way to explain the fulfilled prophecies in the Bible other than by divine origin.
This unity is unique from all other books and is evidence of the divine origin of the words which God moved men to record.
The Bible contains hundreds of detailed prophecies relating to the future of individual nations including Israel, certain cities, and mankind.
Unlike the prophecies found in other religious books or those by men such as Nostradamus, biblical prophecies are extremely detailed.
Not only was it foretold where He would be born and His lineage, but also how He would die and that He would rise again.
There simply is no logical way to explain the fulfilled prophecies in the Bible other than by divine origin.
There is no other religious book with the extent or type of predictive prophecy that the Bible contains.
Another of the internal evidences that indicates the Bible is truly God’s Word is the prophecies contained within its pages.

This authority and power are best seen in the way countless lives have been transformed by the supernatural power of God’s Word.
Drug addicts have been cured by it, homosexuals set free by it, derelicts and deadbeats transformed by it, hardened criminals reformed by it, sinners rebuked by it, and hate turned to love by it.

The Bible does possess a dynamic and transforming power that is only possible because it is truly God’s Word.
There are also external evidences that indicate the Bible is truly the Word of God.
One is the historicity of the Bible.

Because the Bible details historical events, its truthfulness and accuracy are subject to verification like any other historical document.
Through both archaeological evidences and other writings, the historical accounts of the Bible have been proven time and time again to be accurate and true.
Through both archaeological evidences and other writings, the historical accounts of the Bible have been proven time and time again to be accurate and true.
The fact that the Bible accurately and truthfully records historically verifiable events is a great indication of its truthfulness when dealing with religious subjects and doctrines and helps substantiate its claim to be the very Word of God.
Another external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the integrity of its human authors.
As mentioned earlier, God used men from many walks of life to record His words.
Their lives and deaths testify to the fact that the Bible truly is God’s Word.
The men who wrote the New Testament and many hundreds of other believers (1 Corinthians 15:6) knew the truth of their message because they had seen and spent time with Jesus Christ after He had risen from the dead.
The fact that the Bible accurately and truthfully records historically verifiable events is a great indication of its truthfulness when dealing with religious subjects and doctrines and helps substantiate its claim to be the very Word of God.
Their lives and deaths testify to the fact that the Bible truly is God’s Word.
A final external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the indestructibility of the Bible.
A final external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the indestructibility of the Bible.
From early Roman Emperors like Diocletian, through communist dictators and on to modern-day atheists and agnostics, the Bible has withstood and outlasted all of its attackers and is still today the most widely published book in the world.
A final external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the indestructibility of the Bible.
Throughout time, skeptics have regarded the Bible as mythological, but archeology has confirmed it as historical.
Opponents have attacked its teaching as primitive and outdated, but its moral and legal concepts and teachings have had a positive influence on societies and cultures throughout the world.
It continues to be attacked by pseudo-science, psychology, and political movements, yet it remains just as true and relevant today as it was when it was first written.
It is a book that has transformed countless lives and cultures throughout the last 2000 years.
No matter how its opponents try to attack, destroy, or discredit it, the Bible remains; its veracity and impact on lives is unmistakable.
The accuracy which has been preserved despite every attempt to corrupt, attack, or destroy it is clear testimony to the fact that the Bible is truly God’s Word and is supernaturally protected by Him.
A final external evidence that the Bible is truly God’s Word is the indestructibility of the Bible.
After all, Jesus said, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Mark 13:31).
After looking at the evidence, one can say without a doubt that, yes, the Bible is truly God’s Word.

To those who are redeemed and have their sin forgiven, God gives eternal life, an existence so glorious that “no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9, NLT).
At death, the body ceases to function and begins the process of returning to the earth, but the spiritual part of man lives on: “The dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7; cf.
To those who are redeemed and have their sin forgiven, God gives eternal life, an existence so glorious that “no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9, NLT).
The Bible tells us that, yes, there is life after death.
Jesus Christ, God incarnate, came to the earth to pay for our sins and give us the gift of eternal life: “He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).
Jesus Christ, God incarnate, came to the earth to pay for our sins and give us the gift of eternal life: “He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).
In Jesus’ prayer in this passage, He equates “eternal life” with a knowledge of God and of the Son.
Three days after His crucifixion, Jesus proved Himself victorious over death by rising from the grave—He is life personified (John 11:25) and the ultimate proof that there is life after death.
The apostle Paul invited people to question the over 500 eyewitnesses who saw Jesus after His resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:6).
Jesus Christ, God incarnate, came to the earth to pay for our sins and give us the gift of eternal life: “He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).
The resurrection of the Christ is a well-documented event.
The apostle Paul invited people to question the over 500 eyewitnesses who saw Jesus after His resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:6).

The resurrection of Christ, which gives us the sure hope of life after death, is the cornerstone of the Christian faith (1 Corinthians 15:12–19).
Because Christ was raised from the dead, we have faith that we, too, will be resurrected.
The fact of life after death does not mean everyone will go to heaven, however.
The resurrection of Christ, which gives us the sure hope of life after death, is the cornerstone of the Christian faith (1 Corinthians 15:12–19).
Just as God raised up Jesus’ body, so will our bodies be resurrected upon Jesus’ return (1 Corinthians 6:14).
The fact of life after death does not mean everyone will go to heaven, however.
Each person must make a choice in this life, a choice that will determine his or her eternal destination.
It is appointed for us to die once, and after that will come judgment (Hebrews 9:27).
Those who have been made righteous by faith in Christ will go into eternal life in heaven, but those who have rejected Christ as Savior will be sent to eternal punishment in hell (Matthew 25:46).
Hell, like heaven, is a literal place.
It is a place where the unrighteous will experience the never-ending, eternal wrath of God.
It is a place where the unrighteous will experience the never-ending, eternal wrath of God.
Hell is described as a lake of fire where the inhabitants will be tormented day and night forever and ever (Revelation 20:10).
In hell, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, indicating intense grief and anger (Matthew 13:42).
In hell, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, indicating intense grief and anger (Matthew 13:42).
God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked but desires them to turn from their wicked ways so that they can live (Ezekiel 33:11).
But He will not force us into submission; if we choose to reject Christ, the one and only Savior, we reject the heaven that He has prepared, and we will live eternally apart from Him.
Life on earth is a preparation for what is to come.
For believers in Christ, life after death is eternal life in heaven with God.
How can we receive eternal life and avoid hell?
There is only one way—through faith in Jesus Christ.
Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life.
The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die” (John 11:25–26).
The free gift of eternal life is available to all.
“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them” (John 3:36).

 The Bible, God’s Word, tells us what God is like and what He is not like.
Without the authority of the Bible, any attempt to explain God’s attributes would be no better than an opinion, which by itself is often incorrect, especially in understanding God (Job 42:7).
To say that it is important for us to try to understand what God is like is a huge understatement.
Failure to do so can cause us to set up, chase after, and worship false gods contrary to His will (Exodus 20:3-5).
Only what God has chosen to reveal of Himself can be known.
One of God’s attributes or qualities is “light,” meaning that He is self-revealing in information of Himself (Isaiah 60:19; James 1:17).
The fact that God has revealed knowledge of Himself should not be neglected (Hebrews 4:1).
Creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh (Jesus Christ) will help us to know what God is like.
Let’s start by understanding that God is our Creator and that we are a part of His creation (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 24:1) and are created in His image.
Man is above the rest of creation and was given dominion over it (Genesis 1:26-28).
Creation is marred by the fall but still offers a glimpse of God’s works (Genesis 3:17-18; Romans 1:19-20).
By considering creation’s vastness, complexity, beauty, and order, we can have a sense of the awesomeness of God.
Reading through some of the names of God can be helpful in our search of what God is like.
They are as follows:
       Yahweh - LORD “I Am,” meaning the eternal self-existent God (Exodus 3:13, 14).
God is eternal, meaning He had no beginning and His existence will never end.
He is immortal and infinite (Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2; 1 Timothy 1:17).
God is immutable, meaning He is unchanging; this in turn means that God is absolutely reliable and trustworthy (Malachi 3:6; Numbers 23:19; Psalm 102:26, 27).
God is incomparable; there is no one like Him in works or being.
He is unequaled and perfect (2 Samuel 7:22; Psalm 86:8; Isaiah 40:25; Matthew 5:48).
God is inscrutable, unfathomable, unsearchable, and past finding out as far as understanding Him completely (Isaiah 40:28; Psalm 145:3; Romans 11:33, 34).
God is just; He is no respecter of persons in the sense of showing favoritism (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 18:30).
God is omnipotent; He is all-powerful and can do anything that pleases Him, but His actions will always be in accord with the rest of His character (Revelation 19:6; Jeremiah 32:17, 27).
God is omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere, but this does not mean that God is everything (Psalm 139:7-13; Jeremiah 23:23).
God is omniscient, meaning He knows the past, present, and future, including what we are thinking at any given moment.
Since He knows everything, His justice will always be administered fairly (Psalm 139:1-5; Proverbs 5:21).
God is one; not only is there no other, but He is alone in being able to meet the deepest needs and longings of our hearts.
God alone is worthy of our worship and devotion (Deuteronomy 6:4).
God is righteous, meaning that God cannot and will not pass over wrongdoing.
It is because of God’s righteousness and justice that, in order for our sins to be forgiven, Jesus had to experience God’s wrath when our sins were placed upon Him (Exodus 9:27; Matthew 27:45-46; Romans 3:21-26).
God is sovereign, meaning He is supreme.
All of His creation put together cannot thwart His purposes (Psalm 93:1; 95:3; Jeremiah 23:20).
God is spirit, meaning He is invisible (John 1:18; 4:24).
God is a Trinity.
He is three in one, the same in substance, equal in power and glory.
God is truth, He will remain incorruptible and cannot lie (Psalm 117:2; 1 Samuel 15:29).
God is holy, separated from all moral defilement and hostile toward it.
God sees all evil and it angers Him.
God is referred to as a consuming fire (Isaiah 6:3; Habakkuk 1:13; Exodus 3:2, 4-5; Hebrews 12:29).
God is gracious, and His grace includes His goodness, kindness, mercy, and love.
If it were not for God’s grace, His holiness would exclude us from His presence.
Thankfully, this is not the case, for He desires to know each of us personally (Exodus 34:6; Psalm 31:19; 1 Peter 1:3; John 3:16, 17:3).
Since God is an infinite Being, no human can fully answer this God-sized question, but through God’s Word, we can understand much about who God is and what He is like.
May we all wholeheartedly continue to seek after Him (Jeremiah 29:13).

 The Four Spiritual Laws are a way of sharing the good news of the salvation that is available through faith in Jesus Christ.
 The Four Spiritual Laws are a way of sharing the good news of the salvation that is available through faith in Jesus Christ.
The first of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life."
John 3:16 tells us, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."
John 10:10 gives us the reason that Jesus came, "I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."
John 10:10 gives us the reason that Jesus came, "I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."
What is blocking us from God’s love?
What is preventing us from having an abundant life?
The second of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Humanity is tainted by sin and is therefore separated from God.
As a result, we cannot know God’s wonderful plan for our lives."
Romans 3:23 affirms this information, "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
Romans 6:23 gives us the consequences of sin, "the wages of sin is death."
God created us to have fellowship with Him.
What is blocking us from God’s love?
What is the solution?
The third of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "Jesus Christ is God’s only provision for our sin.
Through Jesus Christ, we can have our sins forgiven and restore a right relationship with God."
We have ruined the relationship with Him that God intended us to have.
Romans 5:8 tells us, "But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 informs us of what we need to know and believe in order to be saved, "...that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures..." Jesus Himself declares that He is the only way of salvation in John 14:6, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me."
How can I receive this wonderful gift of salvation?
The Fourth of the Four Spiritual Laws is, "We must place our faith in Jesus Christ as Savior in order to receive the gift of salvation and know God’s wonderful plan for our lives."
John 1:12 describes this for us, "Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God."
We can be saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone (Ephesians 2:8-9).
If you want to trust in Jesus Christ as your Savior, say the following words to God.
Saying these words will not save you, but trusting in Christ will!
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and deserve punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
The phrase "born again" literally means "born from above."
The question logically comes, "Why does a person need to be born again?"
 The classic passage from the Bible that answers this question is John 3:1-21.
The Lord Jesus Christ is talking to Nicodemus, a prominent Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin (the ruling body of the Jews).
Nicodemus had come to Jesus at night with some questions.
As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, “‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’ ‘How can a man be born when he is old?’ Nicodemus asked.
As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, “‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’ ‘How can a man be born when he is old?’ Nicodemus asked.
‘Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be born!’ Jesus answered, ‘I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.
You should not be surprised at my saying, “You must be born again”’” (John 3:3-7).
The phrase "born again" literally means "born from above."
He needed a change of his heart—a spiritual transformation.
New birth, being born again, is an act of God whereby eternal life is imparted to the person who believes (2 Corinthians 5:17; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:3; 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1-4, 18).
John 1:12, 13 indicates that being "born again" also carries the idea of "becoming children of God" through trust in the name of Jesus Christ.
The apostle Paul in Ephesians 2:1 says, "And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins" (NKJV).
To the Romans he wrote, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
Sinners are spiritually “dead”; when they receive spiritual life through faith in Christ, the Bible likens it to a rebirth.
Only those who are born again have their sins forgiven and have a relationship with God.
How does that come to be?
Ephesians 2:8-9 states, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."
When one is saved, he/she has been born again, spiritually renewed, and is now a child of God by right of new birth.
Trusting in Jesus Christ, the One who paid the penalty of sin when He died on the cross, is the means to be "born again."
"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation: the old has gone, the new has come!"
If you have never trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior, will you consider the prompting of the Holy Spirit as He speaks to your heart?
You need to be born again.
Will you pray the prayer of repentance and become a new creation in Christ today?
"Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God" (John 1:12-13).
If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and be born again, here is a sample prayer.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness—the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
The word “Christian” literally means, “belonging to the party of Christ” or a “follower of Christ.”
 A dictionary definition of a Christian would be something similar to “a person professing belief in Jesus as the Christ or in the religion based on the teachings of Jesus.” While this is a good starting point, like many dictionary definitions, it falls somewhat short of really communicating the biblical truth of what it means to be a Christian.
The word “Christian” is used three times in the New Testament (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Peter 4:16).
Followers of Jesus Christ were first called “Christians” in Antioch (Acts 11:26) because their behavior, activity, and speech were like Christ.
The word “Christian” literally means, “belonging to the party of Christ” or a “follower of Christ.”
  Unfortunately over time, the word “Christian” has lost a great deal of its significance and is often used of someone who is religious or has high moral values but who may or may not be a true follower of Jesus Christ.
Many people who do not believe and trust in Jesus Christ consider themselves Christians simply because they go to church or they live in a “Christian” nation.
But going to church, serving those less fortunate than you, or being a good person does not make you a Christian.
Going to church does not make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile.
Being a member of a church, attending services regularly, and giving to the work of the church does not make you a Christian.
The Bible teaches that the good works we do cannot make us acceptable to God.
Titus 3:5 says, “He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.
He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.” So, a Christian is someone who has been born again by God (John 3:3; John 3:7; 1 Peter 1:23) and has put faith and trust in Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 2:8 tells us that it is “…by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.” 
 A true Christian is a person who has put faith and trust in the person and work of Jesus Christ, including His death on the cross as payment for sins and His resurrection on the third day.
John 1:12 tells us, “Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” The mark of a true Christian is love for others and obedience to God’s Word (1 John 2:4, 10).
A true Christian is indeed a child of God, a part of God’s true family, and one who has been given new life in Jesus Christ.
                                                                                         Answer
 The core beliefs of Christianity are summarized in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.
Jesus died for our sins, was buried, was resurrected, and thereby offers salvation to all who will receive Him in faith.
Unique among all other faiths, Christianity is more about a relationship than religious practices.
Instead of adhering to a list of “do’s and don’ts,” the goal of a Christian is to cultivate a close walk with God.
That relationship is made possible because of the work of Jesus Christ and the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
Beyond these core beliefs, there are many other items that are, or at least should be, indicative of what Christianity is and what Christians believe.
Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired, “God-breathed” Word of God and that its teaching is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
Christians believe in one God that exists in three persons—the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit.
Christians believe that mankind was created specifically to have a relationship with God, but sin separates all men from God (Romans 3:23; 5:12).
Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ walked this earth, fully God, and yet fully man (Philippians 2:6-11), and died on the cross.
Christians believe that after His death, Christ was buried, He rose again, and now lives at the right hand of the Father, making intercession for the believers forever (Hebrews 7:25).
Christianity proclaims that Jesus’ death on the cross was sufficient to completely pay the sin debt owed by all men and this is what restores the broken relationship between God and man (Hebrews 9:11-14; 10:10; Romans 5:8; 6:23).
Christianity teaches that in order to be saved and be granted entrance into heaven after death, one must place one’s faith entirely in the finished work of Christ on the cross.
If we believe that Christ died in our place and paid the price of our own sins, and rose again, then we are saved.
There is nothing that anyone can do to earn salvation.
We cannot be “good enough” to please God on our own, because we are all sinners (Isaiah 53:6; 64:6-7).
There is nothing more to be done, because Christ has done all the work!
When He was on the cross, Jesus said, “It is finished” (John 19:30), meaning that the work of redemption was completed.
According to Christianity, salvation is freedom from the old sin nature and freedom to pursue a right relationship with God.
Where we were once slaves to sin, we are now slaves to Christ (Romans 6:15-22).
As long as believers live on this earth in their sinful bodies, they will engage in a constant struggle with sin.
However, Christians can have victory in the struggle with sin by studying and applying God’s Word in their lives and being controlled by the Holy Spirit—that is, submitting to the Spirit’s leading in everyday circumstances.
So, while many religious systems require that a person do or not do certain things, Christianity is about believing that Christ died on the cross as payment for our own sins and rose again.
Our sin debt is paid and we can have fellowship with God.
We can have victory over our sin nature and walk in fellowship and obedience with God.
That is true biblical Christianity.

 Crucial Questions
 What is the meaning of life?
 What is the meaning of life?
How can purpose, fulfillment, and satisfaction in life be found?
How can something of lasting significance be achieved?
Many people have never stopped to consider these important questions.
People have testified that, while they achieved their goals of wealth, relationships, and pleasure, there was still a deep void inside, a feeling of emptiness that nothing seemed to fill.
He replied, “I wish that someone would have told me that when you reach the top, there’s nothing there.” Many goals reveal their emptiness only after years have been wasted in their pursuit.
In our humanistic culture, people lose sight of the meaning of life.
Some of these pursuits include business success, wealth, good relationships, sex, entertainment, and doing good to others.
People have testified that, while they achieved their goals of wealth, relationships, and pleasure, there was still a deep void inside, a feeling of emptiness that nothing seemed to fill.
He describes the feeling of emptiness he felt: “Meaningless!
Meaningless!
Everything is meaningless” (Ecclesiastes 1:2).
King Solomon, the writer of Ecclesiastes, had wealth beyond measure, wisdom beyond any man of his time or ours, hundreds of women, palaces and gardens that were the envy of kingdoms, the best food and wine, and every form of entertainment available.
An athlete who had reached the pinnacle of his sport was once asked what he wished someone would have told him when he first started playing his sport.
And yet he summed up life “under the sun”—life lived as though all there is to life is what we can see with our eyes and experience with our senses—is meaningless.
What explains this void?
God created us for something beyond what we can experience in the here-and-now.
In the book of Genesis, we find a clue to the meaning of life in the fact that God created mankind in His image (Genesis 1:26).
In our hearts we are aware that the “here-and-now” is not all that there is.
In the book of Genesis, we find a clue to the meaning of life in the fact that God created mankind in His image (Genesis 1:26).
This means that we are more like God than we are like anything else.
We also find that, before mankind fell and the curse of sin came upon the earth, the following things were true: 1) God made man a social creature (Genesis 2:18–25); 2) God gave man work (Genesis 2:15); 3) God had fellowship with man (Genesis 3:8); and 4) God gave man dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26).
What explains this void?
God intended mankind to have fulfillment in life, but our condition (especially touching our fellowship with God) was adversely affected by the fall into sin and the resulting curse upon the earth (Genesis 3).
God intended mankind to have fulfillment in life, but our condition (especially touching our fellowship with God) was adversely affected by the fall into sin and the resulting curse upon the earth (Genesis 3).
At that time, He will restore full fellowship with redeemed mankind, while the unredeemed will have been judged unworthy and cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11–15).
The curse of sin will be done away with; there will be no more sin, sorrow, sickness, death, or pain (Revelation 21:4).
God will dwell with mankind, and they shall be His children (Revelation 21:7).
Thus, we come full circle: God created us to have fellowship with Him; man sinned, breaking that fellowship; God restores that fellowship fully in the eternal state.
To go through life achieving everything we set out to achieve only to die separated from God for eternity would be worse than futile!
But God has made a way to not only make eternal bliss possible (Luke 23:43) but also life on earth satisfying and meaningful.
How is this eternal bliss and “heaven on earth” obtained?
The meaning of life restored through Jesus Christ
 The real meaning of life, both now and in eternity, is found in the restoration of our relationship with God.
This restoration is only possible through God’s Son, Jesus Christ, who reconciles us to God (Romans 5:10; Acts 4:12; John 1:12; 14:6).
God intended mankind to have fulfillment in life, but our condition (especially touching our fellowship with God) was adversely affected by the fall into sin and the resulting curse upon the earth (Genesis 3).
Salvation and eternal life are gained when we trust in Jesus Christ as Savior.
Once that salvation is received by grace through faith, Christ makes us new creations, and we begin the progressive journey of growing closer to Him and learning to rely on Him.

A “full” life is logically one that is meaningful and devoid of aimless wandering.
Any time we substitute our own glory for God’s, we miss the meaning of life.

So how about a religion that is just right for you?
 Fast food restaurants entice us by allowing us to order our food exactly the way we want it.
Some coffee shops boast over a hundred different flavors and varieties of coffee.
Even when buying houses and cars, we can look for one with all the options and features we desire.
Even when buying houses and cars, we can look for one with all the options and features we desire.
Choice is king!
So how about a religion that is just right for you?
How about a religion that is guilt-free, makes no demands, and is not encumbered with a lot of bothersome do’s and don’ts?
Aren’t all religions basically the same?
But is religion something to be chosen like a favorite flavor of ice cream?
There are a lot of voices vying for our attention, so why should anyone consider Jesus above, say, Muhammad or Confucius, Buddha, or Charles Taze Russell, or Joseph Smith?
After all, don’t all roads lead to Heaven?
Aren’t all religions basically the same?
The truth is that all religions do not lead to Heaven, just as all roads do not lead to Indiana.
Jesus alone speaks with the authority of God because Jesus alone conquered death.
Muhammad, Confucius, and the others molder in their graves to this very day.
But Jesus, by His own power, walked away from the tomb three days after dying on a cruel Roman cross.
Anyone with power over death deserves to be heard.
Anyone with power over death deserves to be heard.
The evidence supporting the resurrection of Jesus is overwhelming.
First, there were over five hundred eye witnesses of the risen Christ!
Five hundred voices cannot be ignored.
The tomb was empty!
The enemies of Jesus could have easily stopped all talk of the resurrection by producing His dead, decaying body, but there was no dead body for them to produce!
Could the disciples have stolen His body?
The tomb was empty!
To prevent such a contingency, the tomb of Jesus had been heavily guarded by armed soldiers.
Considering His closest followers had fled in fear at His arrest and crucifixion, it is most unlikely this ragtag band of frightened fishermen would have gone head to head against trained, professional soldiers.
Considering His closest followers had fled in fear at His arrest and crucifixion, it is most unlikely this ragtag band of frightened fishermen would have gone head to head against trained, professional soldiers.
The simple fact is that the resurrection of Jesus cannot be explained away!
Again, anyone who has power over death deserves to be heard.
Jesus proved His power over death; therefore, we need to hear what He says.
Jesus claims to be the only way to salvation (John 14:6).
He is not a way; He is not one of many ways.
Jesus is the way.
And this same Jesus says, "Come to me all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).
This is a tough world and life is difficult.
Most of us are pretty well bloodied, bruised, and battle-scarred.
Agree?
So what do you want?
Restoration or mere religion?
A living Savior or one of many dead "prophets"?
A meaningful relationship or empty rituals?
Jesus is not a choice—He is the choice!
Jesus is the right "religion" if you are looking for forgiveness (Acts 10:43).
Jesus is the right "religion" if you are looking for a meaningful relationship with God (John 10:10).
Jesus is the right "religion" if you are looking for an eternal home in Heaven (John 3:16).
Place your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior; you will not regret it!
Place your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior; you will not regret it!
If you want to have a "right relationship" with God, here is a sample prayer.
Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you.
It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin.
This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation.
"God, I know that I have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment.
But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven.
I place my trust in You for salvation.
Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgiveness - the gift of eternal life!
Amen!"
                                                                                         Answer
 The sinner’s prayer is a prayer a person prays to God when they understand that they are a sinner and in need of a Savior.
Saying a sinner’s prayer will not accomplish anything on its own.
A true sinner’s prayer only represents what a person knows, understands, and believes about their sinfulness and need for salvation.
The first aspect of a sinner’s prayer is understanding that we are all sinners.
Romans 3:10 proclaims, "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one."
The Bible makes it clear that we have all sinned.
We are all sinners in need of mercy and forgiveness from God (Titus 3:5-7).
Because of our sin, we deserve eternal punishment (Matthew 25:46).
The sinner’s prayer is a plea for grace instead of judgment.
It is a request for mercy instead of wrath.
The second aspect of a sinner’s prayer is knowing what God has done to remedy our lost and sinful condition.
God took on flesh and became a human being in the Person of Jesus Christ (John 1:1,14).
Jesus taught us the truth about God and lived a perfectly righteous and sinless life (John 8:46; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
Jesus then died on the cross in our place, taking the punishment that we deserve (Romans 5:8).
Jesus rose from the dead to prove His victory over sin, death, and hell (Colossians 2:15; 1 Corinthians chapter 15).
Because of all of this, we can have our sins forgiven and be promised an eternal home in Heaven - if we will just place our faith in Jesus Christ.
All we have to do is believe that He died in our place and rose from the dead (Romans 10:9-10).
We can be saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone.
Ephesians 2:8 declares, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God."

 Questions about Salvation
 Unlike the question “Does God exist?” the question of whether Jesus Christ existed is asked by relatively few people.
 Unlike the question “Does God exist?” the question of whether Jesus Christ existed is asked by relatively few people.
Most accept that Jesus was truly a man who lived in Israel 2,000 years ago.
The debate begins with the discussion of Jesus’ full identity.
Almost every major religion teaches that Jesus was a prophet or a good teacher or a godly man.
C.
S. Lewis in his book Mere Christianity writes the following: “I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him [Jesus Christ]: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God.’ That is the one thing we must not say.
He has not left that option open to us.
A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.
He would either be a lunatic—on a level with a man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of hell.
You must make your choice.
Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse.
You can shut him up for fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God.
But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.
He has not left that option open to us.
He has not left that option open to us.
So, who did Jesus claim to be?
Who does the Bible say He is?
Jesus said in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” At first glance, this might not seem to be a claim to be God.
They tried to stone Him “for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God” (John 10:33).
The Jews rejected Jesus’ identity as God Incarnate, but they understood exactly what He was saying.
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
In John 8:58 Jesus claims pre-existence, an attribute of God: “‘I tell you the truth,’ Jesus answered, ‘before Abraham was born, I am!’” In response to this statement, the Jews again took up stones to stone Jesus (John 8:59).
In claiming pre-existence, Jesus applied a name for God to Himself—I AM (see Exodus 3:14).
The Jews rejected Jesus’ identity as God Incarnate, but they understood exactly what He was saying.
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
The apostle Peter says the same, calling Jesus “our God and Savior” (2 Peter 1:1).
So, who did Jesus claim to be?
The apostle Paul describes Jesus as “our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).
The apostle Paul describes Jesus as “our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).
God the Father bears witness of Jesus’ identity as well: “But about the Son he says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom’” (Hebrews 1:8; cf.
The apostle Paul describes Jesus as “our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).
Psalm 45:6).
 • As C. S. Lewis pointed out, if Jesus is not God, then Jesus is the worst of liars and untrustworthy in every way.
Jesus had to be both God and man.
• If Jesus is not God, then the apostles would likewise have been liars.
In the following verses, Jesus never corrects the Jews or attempts to clarify His statement.
The Jews rejected Jesus’ identity as God Incarnate, but they understood exactly what He was saying.
Other biblical clues that Jesus is God in the flesh include John 1:1, which says, “The Word was God,” coupled with John 1:14, which says, “The Word became flesh.” Thomas the disciple declared to Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28), Jesus does not correct him.
Why is the question of Jesus’ identity so important?
Why does it matter whether Jesus is God?
• If Jesus is not God, His death would have been insufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2).
Only God Himself could provide an infinite, eternally valuable sacrifice (Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
As God, Jesus could satisfy God’s wrath.
As a man, Jesus had the capability of dying.
Salvation is available only through faith in Jesus Christ.
Salvation is available only through faith in Jesus Christ.
As He proclaimed, “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
